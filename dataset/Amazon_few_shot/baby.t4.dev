we live 1.5 story home where master only thing upstairs my husband runs isp home - lots computers house , so we find good monitor would drown out static electronics outside world , but allow us hear our little pip-squeek clearly . first i thrilled sony when i used it downstairs during her daytime napping loved i could set it voice-activated only hear it when she reallllly awake ! but night when we used it upstairs it kept picking up interferrence form loud static chirp after several hours silence even though it voice-activated mode . i tried moving it several times , but finally ended up going back old fp sounds lights one we which really wasn't any better ! ( run up down stairs try all combinations 9 channels receiver transmitter sony royal pain ! ) next day i went target found first years digital 2.4 ghz monitor what difference ! it same price sony , but it searches clear channel like your phone . i afraid it would interfere out 2.4 ghz phones , but after week , no problems we no static/interferrence ! it crystal clear no matter where house ( hubby even took it into computer room able hear her wake up just fine ! ) i know everyone environment different , but sony definately didn't work us	-1
worst product ever ! safety 1st should recall this item if they any sense all . i'd like smack so called engineer designed this infant tub . my 10 month old son pinched his little privates so bad it gave him blood blister . yeah , ouch !!! stinkin bar goes legs slides out place when baby moves -- snap ! it pinches their private part . everything just fine then suddenly my son looked me such panic then screamed cried . i realize what happened quickly moved bar . ouch ! it still makes me grit my teeth when i think it . horrible product especially baby boys .	-1
we really cheap monitor before we bought this one because it just so noisy .. so we bought this one thinking it going quieter . well , it alot quieter than our monitor , but like others said , it makes this awful beeping noise ! it gone off twice middle night before ! we also digital phone , so it constantly switching channels well trying find available channel . i would look elsewhere monitor .. beeping what gets me - i dont like woke up very loud beep middle night !	-1
if you infant enjoys mental stimulation , this item not you . since she brought home my daughter enjoyed looking held so she see all around her . she bored tears ( literally ) every time we put her lounger ( baby faces ceiling .. not too exciting ) . i thought it cool concept , however , my daughter not . she much better her papasan , or bouncy seat where she could nap if she wanted , but option look around play well . looking up ceiling not fun my daughter	-1
when i ordered this product , i hoping my baby girl enjoy it . i so excited when my baby likes spend time it . this happiness only lasted two days before mobile , lights , music stopped working . i am little bit concerned quality this product . i return swing consider type swing my baby .	-1
i love my medela pump style but their breastmilk storage bags awful . twis t-t ie closure complicated . they also spill milk easily when pouring into bottle after thawing . i recommend lansinoh bags . they easy-to-use double zip closure ensure milk stay fresh it very easy get air out bag before closing . you also lay them flat freeze so they won't take up much space freezer . they pour great - no spills !	-1
we bought this 6 weeks ago , it already stopped beeping when nipple sterlised or milk warm . now markings its measuring cup coming off . basically , i believe minchkin cut corners poor quality product . not recommended all ... i would prefer some other brand	-1
i loved this first . but after two months daily use thing broke . i cant get it back together . i think i just go back walking diapers regular trash outside	-1
i just received this product after much research , i am really disappointed it quality . mattres so stiff hard especially baby , sheets provided like emory board , scratchy stiff . my baby too long this , so her feet fall off edge mattres . i just thought it would much better than this . looks like i returning it . my daughter now sleeping her bouncy chair , tied down back reduce bounce fluffy pillow underneath it also reduce bounce	-1
we read directions product still works sporadically . my wife physician ! leaking problem incredibly frustrating , especially when baby crying . buy anything else - you very disappointed , especially this price point	-1
we asked 2 these got both . material itchy scratchy never got softer . it very thin you could see pattern through sheet . it easy put mainly b/c it bit big . they ended up closet no time	-1
don't buy this sheet !! it not much thicker than piece tissue paper ! spit up would go right through it . i much better solution you -- buy couple sheet savers use your pack-n-play . they couple $$ less sold " especially baby " (which b-r-us house brand ) . they great . i use them both my son crib pack play . they come number colors so you should able match them just any pattern	-1
i told these wonderful , keep your baby safe while sleeping his side or back . but my little man slides down where his face foam sides . this worries me more than if he sleep his stomach	-1
this very cute bouncer chair . however , i feel it poorly designed . it sets baby almost laying down so it difficult play toys . addition , our baby acid reflux it not good chair him because it sets him back too far . we find one set more upright	-1
we this stroller aren't really thrilled it . fact , we're going buy different double stroller replace it . our children aged 2 years 4 months . while 3 month old still his car seat/carrier , this stroller worked well him . he now out grown carrier , we've put him seat stroller . shoulder straps too tight him don't adjust well . seat isn't padded well there no head support . our 2 year old not like back stroller . infant front , we keep it reclined , so my daughter lean forward if she sitting back . she hates standing it because she very short she can't see anything . she would much prefer sit front . we find basket bottom practically useless . we can't reach it so we never use it . there no cup holder or tray parents . it also bit bulky when folded heavy . so , i think we put this stroller storage until kids older get double stroller 2 seats now	-1
i received this gift loved it first . but after using it just 3 times one support poles snapped when we putting it up . i bummed too because i loved it so much . if you buy it , careful when you handle it - it not durable it seems	-1
i bought this sling when i still pregnant . after my son born i tried putting him it but he just didn't seem secure , so i threw it back closet . when he turned one , i dug it out again , thinking it would work well hip carrier , but it even worse this ! i him this total five minutes it awful . first all , buckles should not placed so they hit wearer either neck or shoulder bone , it very painful heavier baby . i took him out it never touch thing again	-1

lucky me i didn't pay this pump but hospital gave it me . i could only get two drops milk every ten pumps . what waste time . you would figure hospital would know if pump worked	-1
i looked amazing computer but let me tell you it ugly ! we recived it my mail it cheap plastic fake wood !!! needless say it went back !!! i also upset way it delivered it left my front patio blocking my door pouring rain ... so i am sure crib wet well	-1

i bought this seat my son when he probably around 6 months old just starting solid foods . ten months later , i hardly ever use darn thing . it worked okay us little while but it not one my better baby purchases . my complaints product : - not particularly sturdy . backrest portion particular seems pop off way too easily . - straps secure it kitchen chair annoyingly long way . not such problem when seat secured chair because you just tuck straps somewhere . however , everytime i remove seat chair straps prove real pain rear . unfortunately it seems i need unstrap remove seat after every meal clean bits food inevitably end up big chair which this seat secured ( complaint ) . - second tray which pops over swing away tray ( least my particular model ) very easily removed my son . he lifts it up dumps his food floor . point this second tray make food prep cleanup easier but it fails miserably . - this seat not all sturdy or useful stand alone seat . it strapped chair or it easily tip over . good things this product it relatively inexpensive good spacesaving alternative regular highchair which sucks up so much floor space . it also fairly easy clean due plastic design . overall it not bad product but not my list favorites . if i it over , i would bought similar type chair but probably different brand	-1
i agree first reviewer , " cindy " -- i love concept , but proportions this swaddler just aren't right , unless you really tiny baby or one doesn't kick his/her legs much ( my one-month old boy weighs 11 lbs 23 inches long . ) . velcro doesn't hold because patches too small , knit fabric too stretchy . however , i put him larger size swaddleme today , it fits much better	-1
don't buy peg-perego their customer service horrible !! i never buy them again !!	-1
i read other reviews said it headache , but i went ahead purchased this item because it less expense than anything i else i saw . i should listened ... i ordered it feb , it now may we still don't dresser together . there pieces missing , major piece broken . when you try call , line busy . i hang up redial , what felt like forever . they said my piece would come 3 weeks , it more like 7 weeks . piece broken drawer rails it , but when it came , it no rails . so , i said i wanted return entire thing , they fine it , but it take up 8 weeks get your money back . so , this point time , we going go hardware store buy what we need so i dresser my son room .	-1
nursing mother i researched many different brands bottles find easiest one my little one make transition . i read so many sources soothie would make transition easiest babies . i bought starter kit several other bottles . i greatly dissapointed learn out all bottle i purchased only one not leak . i tried repositioning nipple i tried tighten lid . nothing helped . my son soaked everytime we tried use them . i switched brand now we very dry	-1
don't waste your money this high chair . time your infant safely sit it , they almost outgrown it . you're just paying name brand , not quality . stick w/ graco instead	-1
not purchase this product if you plan use your play yard bassinet . tent snaps same spot you not use both	-1
ok so how many people think their baby exceptional ? well , pretty much everyone i know , they all right course . each baby exceptional , their own way . but how many babies rated exceptional pediatricians , nurses early childhood educators ? well , i know one - mine ! i faithfully used babyplus system when i pregnant . one time when using it , he started knocking back . yeap , i actually felt him knock back it , rhythm . it only happened once , but i told my husband i think this going one special kid . i 7 months pregnant then . well , lo behold , after he born people ( professionals ) don't stop telling us how amazing he . he most aware newborn you ever meet . he 2 months old now , sleeping through night ( 11 hours time ) since he 2 weeks . he cries when he needs something , never cries no reason ( but i make sure respond quickly his needs so i don't know how much it . ) . yesterday he started reaching objects . can't quite grab them yet , but it doesn't stop him trying . pediatrician nurse remarked how incredibly physically strong he , how aware he seems fact he vocalizes music unheard this age . he holding his head up since day he born ( 3 days late ) making eye contact since 2 weeks . so , i don't really know what if anything baby plus system it . i mean it could just accident but ... all i say i definitely use this product our future children . i would pay thousands if i ( we not rich people ) because its worth every penny	1
this item invaluable preventing plagiocephaly ( flattening head ) ... i wish we known it our twins . newborns especially need very soft surface their very soft malleable skulls . we used it our third baby result , he perfectly round head proportioned features . incline greatly reduced spit up ' flap ' their esophagus stomach not developed yet . gravity prevents milk/formula traveling back up causing gas or spit up . i've noticed biggest complaint this item infants seem slip down it during night . this true , however , rolling up receiving blanket real tight placing it " u " shape under our son bottom prevented this happening ever again . result , he slept soundly , never spit up once , never woke us up gas pain perfectly round head . i strongly recommend boppy noggin nest well keep pressure off head when your baby not his crib . also , if your baby old enough roll over , this item not you . one other note : foam wedges either side trap some body heat , so don't over-swaddle or put too many layers ... adjust thickness your blanket ambient temperature . i would say this good item newborns 5 months . it made enourmous difference well our third child compared his older twin siblings	1

when my daughter born , i didn't know swaddling , it would take me hours get her sleep ! i would feed or rock her my arms until she falls asleep , then put her her crib ... she'd flail her arms , wake up cry , i start all over ! what nightmare ! then i figured out since her arms wake her , it would make sense wrap her something so she couldn't move them much ... so i started wrapping her regular receiving blankets . it worked ! it became much easier get her sleep . but then she wiggled out those receiving blankets wake up again . when she little over month old , somehow i came across swaddleme blankets internet immediately bought it . it worked great ! it so easy wrap my daughter it , it stayed put . my daughter started sleeping so much better ! i wish i found those blankets sooner - it would've saved me so many sleepless nights ! 2 years later , my son born , thankfully i already knew those blankets start . he goes sleep great swaddleme blanket ! out curiosity , i tried put him sleep without this blanket , his arms wake him right away - exactly same my daughter ! i consider this blanket one most important baby items you could buy . it should must new mother who wants get some sleep	1

i using diaper genie i wasn't all impressed . i shop needing pick up genie refills saw this pail sale $14 . i bought it . day one i loved it i threw out genie i won't go back . it only got 4 stars because you need buy fresh disks every so often . they nice because when you open pail you smell fresh clean sent . also i feel pail could taller , when i change kitchen bag ( which only time you really smell foul diapers ) my bag only 3/4 way full . but other than its great investment , no smelly nursery no dang refills buy	1
i own this seat my son who age 6 . it law my state children must booster or car seat until age 8 . seat material high quality cushioning very comfotable . headrest perfect long trips since my son fall asleep without annoying crick his neck . price decent too . only issue i this seat cupholders . if you regular sedan want fit others your car , cupholders aren't very usable . additionally , cupholders don't slide out very well when child sitting seat . personally , i leave cupholders pushed . i carseat young infant my sedan must fit my 10-year old back seat . i wish carseat booster seat makers would instead make mesh bag pocket hang right off botton front kid toys such . furthermore , booster seats general , i think they very impractical families who need fit 3 kids across backseat . my son very hard time buckling his seat belt because he must reach side where space premium . i would love forward-facing booster seat 5-point harness would lock into latch loops older child . not only 5-point seat harness safer but it much easier child buckle themselves instead reaching around side . far options available child who outgrown convertible seat but too small regular seat belt , this nice option .	1

i bought this my son when he just shy 4 months old . initially , he would just sit seat , occassionally moving sideways ( probably because he lost his balance ) . after 5-10 minutes he ready hit eject button ( he'd enough ) . lasted 4 or 5 days during which we'd put him jumperoo 2 or 3 times per day hopes he'd grow enjoy it . 5th day he began jumping up-and-down like crazed kangaroo ! his face wide smile some drool , he excited ! point forward ( still going ) he consistently loved his time j-roo . he regularly jumping sessions 30-45 minutes while watching clifford , dragon tales , ... this great way little upright position while strengthening his little legs . also , it not bad break us parents now again	1

my son 13 months old 25 pounds . one mother wrote her 10 month old 24 pound baby could not fit it , but my son fits into it fine room grow he even considered amp ; quot ; big babyamp ; quot ; . i think people need take into consideration height weight proportion when buying product . every child different , different weight height which means different shapes . instead my huge high chair kitchen , i now small booster stays one kitchen table seats slides right under table w/ chair when my son not it . it great space saver .	1
i love this potty !! my 16 month old daughter sits it long time before wanting off , it seams comfortable . her little feet touch ground so she feels stable . i would recommend this chair	1

i got this pump because i wasn't sure if i would need electric stay-at-home mom . this pump easy use clean . ergonomic pump handle pretty easy hands wrist ( i could pump even when i tendonitis which hurt when i moved my thumb ) . it not take up much room when disassembled so it'll great travelling . i'm not thrilled soft comfort flange provided . i prefer regular plastic medela flanges come their electric pumps . i find i get much milk out this manual pump i medela pump style electric same time this one makes lot less noise ( great middle night pumping sessions ease engorgement without waking my baby husband up ) . also , just note some people problems getting milk out medelas ... it may not pump itself but size flanges . every woman breast nipples different sizes . initially , i using standard 24mm flanges ( suction cup things go over your breasts ) . it painful pump my milk would not come out even though i engorged plenty milk . it would take me 2 hours just get 2 oz milk ! i went see lactation consultant who suggested i try next size up flanges ( 27mm ) . she got me one try it made world difference . i could immediately pump 2oz under 5 mins . now , i pump daily my electric stock up get 4 oz both breasts under 10 mins ( estimate since i don't really time it cause it so fast ) . i use either my electric my manual depending my mood , whether i need double pump , if i need my hands free ( then i use electric ) or if i'm going pump somewhere besides my bedroom ( i.e. living room while watching tv my husband ) . i am now planning pump donate my milk milk bank . this pump made world difference . i think medela makes flanges 3 different sizes . standard 24mm comes all their pumps , 27mm 30mm .	1
all i say bed quality , strong , kids enjoy it . i didnt know bed so big . this worth your bucks . kids actually feel like they train	1
it great product below $100 price range . pros : it almost all necessary features which other travel system got . low price . cons : there no suspension front wheels	1
i used this co sleeper my son up until he 7 mos old . he now 2 we expecting our second any day now . i can't wait set it up . it lifesaver when i returned work because my son nursed every 2 hours up until 6 mos old . i didn't get out bed feed him it made him feel safe next his mommy daddy . mattress they provide too firm so i suggest you get portable crib mattress fit . i haven't tried one i got yet so i'm not sure which one ideal . i personally didn't set it up so i can't relate concerns others . my husband sets it up takes it down which not often . we use second-hand playpen trips . he hasn't complained it . maybe some sighs frustration . still well worth it	1
this third one these we . our daughter 19 months old we sorry when she out grows this product . it keeps her warm cozy can't come off during night . she seems really like it too	1
i put this stroller system my registry we've using it since my son born last year . he now 11 months still fits infant carrier . we like carrier used multiple cars so we bought extra base . stroller height seems great my husband ( 6'2 " ) me ( 5'8 " ) . we don't feel like we hunched over when pushing i t.t he stroller seems like it folds very compactly , but it still doesn't fit into my vw cabrio trunk ( trunk opening just bit small ) . so we use it my husband car we thinking getting compact stroller fit my car . my major complaint using stroller without infant carrier . now my son older wants see everything around him , he doesn't like recline . back adjustable , but we can't get it fully upright , so he always 20 degree angle recline . he started pulling himself forward leaning tray . it ok now , but i think he'll start get annoyed tired when sitting forward like this . overall i would recommend this stroller system	1
our first son slept us we learned mistake our second . our second son sleeping his crib throughout night but i wanted him warm but most importantly safe . when he sleeps night his sleepsack , we feel ease . i highly recommend this product	1
i newborn extremly picky unlike my first baby , she won't sleep anywhere hardly but because this padded she sleep it , i packn'play bassinet also this fits great . it alittle expensive that why i rated it 4 instead 5 becuase not everyone money spend extras like this	1
well , everything i said below true but now 10 months later tub developed it 3rd leak so we inflate it every night foot pump . i'm giving up ordering one . not bad every day use 10 months though . my original review : when our large 6 month old outgrew her tub we looked around other inflatable tubs only realize diameter they gave outside so once it inflated actual tub size even smaller than infant tub we using . we couldn't find snug tub any stores ( babies us carries their own brand , baby depot target only carried munchkin duck tub which so small ) . our 70 year old cast iron tub we definitely liked idea inflatable tub protect her little head harm . she loves bath time so we wanted make it safe possible . well this tub answer . it everything reviewers said - convenient ( blow up once store suction hook ) , big ( lots room toys splashing ) , secure ( fits very snugly , thus name ) bonus obviously you travel it . if you pay couple dollars more get snug tub deluxe versus snug tub you get toys . not i cared but she really love squeaking fish . so bath peace mind fun little one	1

i saw this fisher price sight i fell love it ! i able find it @ toys-r-us store . my 3 y.o daughter seems love it too ! it comes carry so you take it anywhere . i usually keep it back my suv . it especially very convenient when there no place stop when she really go . i just pull over parking lot , open it she sits it goes ! it helps avoid accidents her car sea t.t he only drawback though it built cup . it not removable . my daughter doesn't seem mind it . i don't know if fisher price makes one little girls	1
no more nasty indentions your seats . no more out control chocolate milk spills . i purchased stageseat saver my brand new suv mainly because my daughter eats like caveman ( no offense any living neaderthals ) . she now enjoy beverage snack without getting crumbs all over floor seat below her carseat . seat saver wonderful job containing all spills removed cleaned very easily . it made hard rubber material not move around once your child carseat securely fastened . it also lower flap sits low enough so your toddlers muddy shoes not scuff up front edges your vehicle seats . i recommend this all car seats your vehicle	1
my daughter i love this . i actually saw this before i pregnant loved it because i love turtles . i always said i would buy this . i know it bit pricey what it , but i justified it making it my daughters gift her first christmas ( she only 1 month old ) . i put her bed it turned blue light play soft relaxing music . she honestly goes down pretty well . it casts starts across her crib up her walls both my mom husband complimented how soothing i made her night time . only thing amber light doesn't seem work well showing stars , but there blue green . there actually star constellations it casts it comes little book showing which ones they .	1
i originally bought these bottles b/c they recommended almost every breastfeeding person i asked since i planning breastfeeding i decided go w/ this starter kit . i appreciated variety things kit offer . my baby born prematurely never really took breastfeeding but i decided pump breastmilk feed it her via bottle . i tried several other brands , but none worked well these her . i always found myself buying few more these . i fed my child 6-8 bottles day using avent bottles since day she came home hospital only 1 incident leakage i recognized what i wrong able correct problem w/o further error . i also use these storage time time w/ addition sealing disc . it would nice couple sealing discs included this pack	1
how i count ways ? this tub greeeeeat ! i little trouble first trying inflate it since it indicates only use your mouth but all effort worth it . it very light suction hook latches bathroom title future use .	1
i didn't realize tentacles horns when i purchased it -- i thought they electric touch-sensors . i like horns much more since batteries not required i know it not break easily . my 4-month old son cannot squeeze tentacles make noises ( yet ) but i'm so much fun playing it him ! he loves different textures colors fabrics . i've already purchased two more friends ... this toy bargain $10 ! it definitely worth much more .	1
i never problems these bottles leaking if stored correctly . i use discs nipples when traveling so i don't need full caps except storage . honestly i don't use these freeze , because it would too expensive . i use lansinoh bags these work great fridge shorter term storage . strange little nipples first ones help my son latching problem . he always sucked air when he fed , no problem these , really only reason i buy this product opposed other less expensive bottles storage	1
it excellent product , childproof , easy install works intended . locks only open when key placed , magnet it easy figure out where lock case you forget . you even stick key fridge if you use locks kitchen	1
my baby 8 months old loves this swing . i love it too ! it much easier than other brands fasten unfasten baby swing . i love how tray moves out way get baby out easily . it came hooks too so all we hook it up our existing swing set .	1
these easy use , convenient , make clean-ups breeze . reviewer who complained these don't stick tablecloths -- uh , you're worried germs cleanliness restaurants tablecloths ? i've found these adhere quite well variety surfaces , my son enjoys designs . people frequently stop our table ask where we found these table toppers , then exclaim , " if only they'd those when we baby ! " you've gotta love	1
i really like this mobile . it keeps my 13 week old infant entertained she also falls asleep it time time . she gets so mesmorized it she fall asleep . my only problem it first one they sent me not work but amazon such great job returning it all i email them it not work they sent me one right away replace it all i print label out postage everything taken care , just drop it off post office . i actually got replacement within 4 days so pretty good . they top things .	1
i bought this mat my six-month-old baby . he so excited colorful display mat . you tell his expressions , he just loves colors . i am not sure , if he understands characters yet but colors dazzle him . i guess it good stimulus his brains . also , this mat very inexpensive , good quality very decent size . i highly recommend this product	1
tummy time mat baby enjoys lot . i gave this gift my friend kid they liked it very much . esply aquarium theme it looks nice . kids enjoy waterpart mat . i wud definitely recommend this item anyone	1
this chair good places small , i started using it when my daughter sitting support , it really good her , it saves space , provides support , comfortable , i fully recommend this chair anyone , it very affordable well ..	1
i love this item because it perfect diaper bag or car . it handy me when my baby wasen't feel well i able take her temp . then give her medicine without open five differnt bags	1
we got this instead diaper genie because we wanted something simple easy use -- no turning cranks -- something would still usable after baby out diapers . we love diaper dekor ! we bought 2 refill packs before my son born . he 13 months now , i'm just now shopping more . reviewer mentioned problems installing refills . we trouble first time , but once we'd each it once it breeze . highly recommend this product , though right now it looks like amazon no longer stocking refills . means i go actual babies us store , which i hate . so , if they no longer stock , could serious strike against this product . ( but they still stock diaper dekor + , so i'd get instead .	1
clamp hangs door frame very secure , strap adjustable baby height . it rather hard get baby into it , however . it also rather large bulky my baby gets his hands stuck leg holes . i wish it didn't metal frame fit more snugly around his body so he felt more free jump around . this problem probably not such issue when he gets bigger , though . overall , it good product	1
i especially love this warmer middle night changes . cold wipes shocking baby skin cause lot upset . these warm wipes soothing not shocking . follow instructions add 1/2 cup water over wipes each time you fill warmer . this keeps wipes drying out . nightlight not show much light , but job	1
when deciding which froggy tales items i would need , i wondered how useful this hamper would . i thought it might flimsy not very practical . new mom never ordered nursery stuff before , i didn't know these hampers come separate lining easily lifts out its themed shell ! i happy i bought it . not must-have but definitely 5-star functional accessory .	1
my son 6 months old becoming way heavy me carry bjorn anymore . my low back shoulders we really starting aching . so i decided see if their something else out there i found it ! i torn playtex hip hammock ellaroo . playtex carrier so much good feedback i thought i would love too . i decided get them both give them try . i took hip hammock back immediately . material scratchy uncomfortable . it felt so synthetic looked cheap ugly . i wanted something i could wear out still look stylish . when ellaroo arrived i so happy ! fabric soft beautiful , it really natural feel it . now real test my son love it too . he ! second day he actually feel asleep it . i am able carry him around long time out feeling crippled afterwards . it great shopping well . it folds up small goes instant . my son wont deal sitting his infant carrier while i grocery shop so i would always end up pushing cart , holding him seat way , minding my 3 year old same time . i know you moms relate . now he content riding my hip things lot smoother everyone ! i highly recommend it ! just checking back in- my son one year old now i am still using carrier daily basis . we both comfy happy . now he walking it great keep him up when i don't want him crusing touching everything like doctors office . if i just holding him he would just squirm away get down . carrier also gone through several washings holding up just fine . my husband jokes one day my son wearing me it ! haha	1
this prettiest car seat best fit my baby ! she loves it	1
first time we ordered this bed half parts missing . i called wonderful customer service people they sent replacement bed . after long wait it finally came . it little hard put together but good amp ; quot ; know howamp ; quot ; this bed put together within 30-45 min . it very sturdy , i my husband test it out , he jiggled jubbled it it stayed together perfectly . my daughter loves it	1
i recommend this product all new moms without hesitation . this product awesome ! my baby slept much longer using swaddleme . i'm only sad my baby outgrown size large only 15 pounds ( 4 months ) , but he seems lost startle reflex , which reason he badly needed swaddleme first place . this one those items " must , " i buying all baby showers . i tried brand similar blanket wasn't nearly impressed ; velcro not stay attached . microfleece warm washes well .	1
i * love * this product . it far better velcro swaddler than other brands because it uses bigger patches velcro . comparison blanket , this much easier use provides much more durable swaddles . i'm quite good blanket , but six weeks age , my son could wriggle out . other hand , three months , he never wriggled out cotton flannel swaddleme . however , even cold weather , microfleece too hot . several times i've felt under blanket find my son sweaty . it even worse when we combine swaddle sling . other hand , cotton knit ( solid colors ) blankets too stretchy - my son quickly converts his knit swaddleme into toga , leaving both arms flying free . cotton flannel ( gingham prints ) less stretch than other two fabrics , plenty enough cover keep baby warm indoor temperatures . it trickier find , but worth search . microfleece swaddleme , however , make great non-swaddle blanket cold days , particularly when baby front carrier . velcro quite versatile .	1
we splurged little get this monitor but we very happy we so . i sleep much better night knowing my baby breathing monitored . instructions indicate sensor pad should placed under mattress directly under your baby no bedding or padding . however , i've found sensor work even through mattress , bedding , one inch thick sleep positioner . it super sensitive which great ! one thing keep mind - you should not ceiling fan night or strong draft room ( such ac vent blowing directly onto your baby crib ) . unit pick up air movement room . i highly recommend this product ! i would not resting night peacefully i am without it	1
halo sleepsacks great ! best part it zips bottom . i thought this weird first until i needed change her . you just unzip her stomach , change diaper , zip back down . we few cheaper sacks they zip top which always wakes our little girl up . it totally worth spending little extra money these	1
i decorated my entire nursery this theme am so pleased i could not found better set than this one ... i highly recommend this set everyone ..	1
we this toy since my son 3 weeks old ... he almost 7 months now , he loved it all . it still looks great still barks , when we travel we always sure take " red " thomas ' favorite toy ! it lots ' chewable ' pieces it attatches almost all his travel gear	1
after trying avent bottles my newborn hating them , friend recommened playtex nurser . my daughter very well them 2 weeks old 7 months old . soft nipples more like breastfeeding .	1
my baby enjoy this toy . he likes kick it hear music , i like it 3 modes - it just play music 10 minutes , baby kick it play songs , or it set play like keyboard when kicked . only problem ( one i see many crib toys right now ) it doesn't fit my crib . it 3 ties meant attached spindles crib . problem most cribs now ( such mine ) solid ends , you can't tie anything them . this toy meant used end crib , it simply won't fit . if you crib slats or spindles ends then you fine . i don't , so only way me use this toy hold it while my baby kicks it . fun him , but not me .	1
this good car seat . i can't quite get it level ground like it suppose when base attached , but it works same still . also , clips buckles get turned around sometimes strap . biggest pain i this . my daughter loves it	1
this exactly what we needed keep our baby getting hurt bath tub spout	1
we this system our baby crib , he seems like it more than just music playing nearby stereo . sound quality good low volumes , which appropriate crib bed or naptime , but quality deteriorates quickly once you raise it all . so , if you planning using this yourself , think again - but that not what it designed . i agree no-a/c adapter option stinks , but caught our baby holding ipod charging cord when ipod this device , i realize a/c adapter would just hazard - rechargeable batteries would great addition - that only reason i'm giving it four stars . our baby loves look lights . 15 minute timer great too , that all he really needs . i'd buy it again , plan getting it friends new babies	1
my daughter hospitalized forgot how nurse would naw get frustrated . nipples shield long she able re-learn how nurse using these shields . i highly recommend these moms who trouble nursing	1
i received this travel system yesterday couldnt wait put it together . car seat comes fully assembled but stroller needs put together . i didnt find it difficult all since everything just snaps into place . i gave this 4 stars because i find it little difficult attach carseat stroller . i find myself try quite few times before it snaps into place . other thing closing stroller needs some practice before you get it right . other than those two issues , stroller system very classy different others out there . material very soft touch huge wheels make it whizz push around .	1
this seller provided this great item ( hard find locally ) quickly conveniently , great price . diaper pail works great - wonderful you don't need special bags . very pleased	1
i such difficult time breastfeeding it near impossible me it without crying . after seeing tons lactation consultants i finally decided pump all my sons feedings . i given slightly older model pump style original not very comfortable . so i rented medela symphony month ($90 + starter kit ) . pump amazing but 90 month not so practical . so i bought pis advance . although it not efficient hospital grade symphony this pump amazing job . it much quiter than original 2 phase suction . not only 2 phase suction more efficient , i found initial short suck phase preps my body more intense longer pulls follow . most i'm sure original fantastic but if you're very sensitive pump style advance what you need ( unless you want shell out $90 month . symphony retails around $1250.00 . ouch ! ) good luck	1
i bought this booster seat because we just bought new table chairs , our previous hard plastic booster seat rubbed some paint off our old chairs . this seat wonderful ! it soft enough comfortable , my three year old climb into it herself without it sliding around chair . it rests against wood chairs without damaging them any way . i highly recommend it older toddler , but you might want something little more support younger child	1
attractice , lightweight comfy . grown-up enough kindergartener who would rather not booster all	1
both my 4 year old my little daughter 5 month old hate their noses suctioned ! my little girl reflux spits up lot , due she always quite some milkbuggers up her nose add , she teething like mammoth right now which makes her congested well . first she wanted sqirm away , but hummingsound comes it nice tune it plays destracted her ! since it vibrates quite bit i first touch her cheek it so she knows what expect she immidetly calmes down today started even giggle because it tickled her nose ! long short tip both very soft no sharp edges suction very gentle . yes , i agree it won't suck crusties out nose but even bulb , hard stuff should soaked couple seconds squirt saline up nose soften it . once you bigger buggers come out big tip ! i personally find bulbs invasive aspirators hospital pretty strong , so strong not even stuff use them unless babys oxygen drops due stuffiness nose ! i know i just spent 1 week hospital february my duaghter due rsv , yes those aspirators there shouldn't used unless there no other way ( but even there they use always saline first soften stuff then use suction)oh , way , aspirator comes handy little sack store tips easy take apart clean aspirator ! sure , suction not strong hospital one but hospital cannot used often you want , this one gentle enough even fun little ones while giving them relieve used needed it gentle ! that why it gets 5 stars me	1
this bunting soft inside like breaker outside . it well constructed good buy newborn . it looks feels better than other carriers out there	1
we purchased this walker our son because he loves elmo sesame street . we love it ! our son loves pushing " musical buttons " spinning red circle middle . it glides easily breeze get our son out . cover also comes off easily washing , if necessary . i'm not sure what " papa bear paul " talking , because there no paint our walker there no way our son hand get caught ... even if your little one doesn't enjoy sesame street much ours , you love this walker !	1
don't fooled ! this carseat cover no where near weather proof . that not say it isn't nice product . i like it much better than any other cover i've found . it keep my 3-month-old nice warm , however , flap goes over her head not secured anything . wind easily catches it blows it off	1
if you travel toddler this great item . we one " cheaper " ones before you get what you pay . cheaper one didn't last through first leg our trip ! this one very heavy duty well made .	1
easy use , fast , flexible tip . i believe readings where accurate beeping nice signal fever before you even looked thing . flexible tip also comes handy when you're doing underarm temp taking .... i hate doing rectal one , but this makes me feel like i'm not totally invasive . :	1
these toys don't hold water . they're colorful cute . they also pretty durable when dropped	1
these bags great ! my son extended nicu stay so i pump exclusively very careful hygiene . these i quickly easily sterilize my pump attachments , his bottles , his pacifiers or even couple his toys . all i add some water , microwave , drain . no boiling water , no timing , no accidentally melting things bottom pot , no hassle complicated electronic sterilzers , almost no storage space ! each bag good around 20 uses then you toss it out get new one , so package them lasts quite while . very handy when traveling too , since many hotels gas stations microwaves so you sterilize what you need go without trying haul bunch junk around you	1
this bag very useful , many pockets so everything order . looks very cool , i sometimes use it myself aswell . downside sometimes it hard remember which pocket you put your stuff . it would easier use if it symetrical so i carry it either my left or right shoulder . but result i am glad i it :)	1
i purchased this when my child already going 4 months old . he long tall boy , it winter time , i haven't occassion use this much except church around house . why oh why didn't i get this initially ? i nojo baby sling , which great when i my twenties but really pinched nerve ( literally ) me over decade later . my back feels so much better this product . especially if you already top heavy person , this sling relief . i love color , we'll going florida two months . i intend use this beach maybe zoo	1
we just ordered this crib last weekend already received it put it together . it looks really great . however , when we received box ups , it looked terrible we really afraid crib would damaged . it looks fine , although we touch up few places stain pen . i would recommend you inspect each piece carefully before putting crib together . also , directions came crib said nothing washers included hardware . we just sort figure out use them bolts . so , if you order this crib it comes washers , don't forget put them , because directions won't tell you ! we impressed how fast crib arrived free shipping great too . it wasn't terribly difficult put together , pretty sturdy , i would say it worth what we paid it	1
i love glass bottles , i now peace mind ! during late night feedings my husband i just place glass bottles bottle warmer without fear chemical contamination . only down side glass bottles heavier than plastic ; however , time your baby learn how hold them !!	1
we diaper genie , it total waste money plastic . diaper genie so hard use didn't anything stop odors . my son room smelled if we threw diapers open garbage . we replaced it first years clean air diaper disposal system . it awesome ! greatest thing it it store 6-7 days my son diapers without no yucky odors . wow !! it " clean air " venting system which totally 100% silent . i actually though it broken because it made no noise ! it runs batteries last 9 months . there little light briefly flashes let you know lid secure vent system working . it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags -- saving us money . only drawback occasionally you shut lid it won't fully secure . you'd know two clues , first little green light won't flash . later you'll get second clue -- your baby room start smell ! i now check see if light each time i put diaper make sure lid secure . we love this product so much . our son room smells clean no poopy odors , we save money using our own tall kitchen bags . it also very easy change -- no confusing bag twisting . i highly recommend using this diaper holder , it best	1
after sleepless nights listening my husband snore i mission find something help me sleep while pregnant . i found this pillow target sleeping soundly ever since . must if you pregnant!it little expensive but worth every penny !	1
i searched online sage colored crib bedding weeks before my daughter born finally settled something close . i satisfied it matched well enough maintain cuteness her nursery ( utmost importance ) affordable same time . i seen breathable bumpers but opted " cuter " bedding , confident my child would safe . my daughter started sleeping through night 8 weeks which meant i not going into her room 7-9 hours time , depending night . even though i swaddle her sleeping , she still manages travel around her crib during night well during longer naps . one morning when i heard her wake up , i went into her room find she wiggled her way down southwest corner her crib her face pressed up against " adorable , nursery-matching , affordable " crib bumper . i jerked bumper out bed ran down order breathable bumper . since i put it her crib she pressed up against it two or three times able breath . i am delighted because i think it actually cuter than one i before i don't worry all ( least ! ) . it very clean look green gingham matches crib skirt i got perfectly . only reason i didn't give it 5 stars because fit . it comes 2 pieces : one side crib moves up down one other 3 sides . this leaves 2 openings , one each end front crib , arm or leg could potentially get stuck . it hasn't problem us yet she quit southwest travelling now just spins place . however , i would much rather risk let getting stuck than suffocated baby . i no regrets buying this am advising all my pregnant friends consider breathable option over puffy ones	1
my husband i looked several cribs in-store little unsure buying one over internet , however everything worked out we very pleased w/ our purchase . price , no shipping handling etc . can't beat . crib went together relatively well quite sturdy . wood mark rather easily , but our budget hardwood crib out question . we also purchased davinci emily changer/dresser . they look great together . overall , we very happy w/ our decision	1
this crib heavy duty very sturdy great quality- i am so impressed . i thought it easy put together- packaging took serious beating transit there wasn't scratch or missing piece-for price it exceptonal value .	1
we bought this sleeper our son help plagiocephaly 5-months . unfortunately , we didn't get this product soon enough . time we began use it , our son moving flipping around his crib more . it soon became more hazard since he would slide down his head would end up sleep positioners . we bought other sleep positioners use when he newborn wished we used this instead . product itself great . it easy wash care .	1
good quality car seat . only reason i'm rating it 4 instead 5 it big - it not fit easily rear-facing seat sedan car , but fits well when used forward facing . straps easy adjust . velcro sides seat helpful keeping straps side when putting child into seat	1
