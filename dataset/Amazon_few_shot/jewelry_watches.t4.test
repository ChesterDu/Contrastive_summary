i'm rn bought this watch mainly work purposes . it stylish simple , not overly flashy . convenient second hand which essential me . size perfect , my wrists really small i hate huge watches . i'd say this face size nickel . weight light , making it barely noticable while but same time durable . my only complaint i thought " self adjustable " links meant you take links out yourself . since my wrists small , every watch i've owned i've take jeweler get links taken out . i bought this watch mainly because bonus self adjustable links . my husband finally able take 4 links out but only after getting tiny , tiny screwdriver which noted enclosed instructions . so don't expect these links just pop out i . other than , good value price	1
