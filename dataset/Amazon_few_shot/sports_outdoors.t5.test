well , they looked so cool tv i ordered 2 them i regret it . it awkward get hook back into " rocket " once bait . i took my son fishing them what we ended up doing not launching them out gun/rod . we left pod open bait hook dropped it into water let it drift current . i've come find buying cheesey little rods reels simply waste money . if you're going take little one out fishing , just use your own let them reel yours until their big enough handle decent set up . only reason i gave this 2 stars because it neat idea .

i seen some really dumb things my 46 years but this flashlight near top list . flashlight whose power reserve lasts only 30 minutes after 15 hours spent charging . sad thing after not much more than 3 minutes flashlight down half brightness . 8 minutes after turning it light it gives out useless such you would better turning this flashlight off allowing your eyes adjust darkness least you see more than what you this lame light . i heard some wild stories but reality this flashlight me thinking people who made this monstrosity quite totally completely insane living fantasy land . this flashlight what you buy when you just want prop take up space look good because tool illuminating space it totally , utterly profoundly useless . your good money invested this flashlight instantly becomes money wasted no hope any meaningful return whatsoever . don't say we not warn you ! this flashlight should sign it says i am awesomely pathetic buy your own risk !	-1
i purchased this item based picture . i didn't want cheap looking air-hockey table because i planned keep it long time . price seemed good looks table even though shipping $150 . arranging delivery carrier bit awkward , but not too bad , but box itself clearly abused showed general lack care handling . i don't know if abuse carrier delivering it me or prior carrier , but it me worried condition contents . i couldn't see any parts through holes tears box , so i hoped best . when i opened box , there no obvious shipping damage , however there one spot surface could caused improper packaging . assembly instructions poor quality photocopy cut top line off most pages . there separate sheet paper instructing me line up letter tags during assembly , however , tags not properly placed assembly per diagram sheet would impossible . assuming all parts symmetrical worked just well . i also disappointed quality assembly main components . alignment poor , making final assembly difficult , there excessive adhesive all over place , even playing surface . i able remove most adhesive playing surface except one spot may damage shipping . table comes 90 warranty materials workmanship , but doesn't include shipping . table surface largest component , i'm imagining it would cost most $150 shipping fee it replaced . this point , i'm not willing sink any more money into this table . after table set up , i hoping it would least play well . i disappointed there too . there some plastic guards goals make scoring very difficult . i've never seen anything like them other tables . time you get puck moving fast enough evade your opponents blocking small opening your shooting , it fly off table . fact you spend more time retrieving puck than you playing . maybe this something extra adhesive down sides playing surface , but it still ruins game . there lot excited kids when table arrived . they all played one game now table sits unused . all all , this my most disappointing online purchase . i guess there some things you see first hand before you buy	-1

i wanted bike ride around unpaved trails my few acres country . this retro designed , one speed , steel framed , coaster braked , comfort bike seemed ideal choice . when it arrived , i pulled out tool box set work assembling it . first frustration instructions assembling this bike not included manual ( which seems cover every bike but this one ) . how hard could it write up instructions ( tool specifications)for each model they manufacture ? one page flyer could trick . further complicate matters , some models manual assembled using metric tools others call standard sizes . it turned out i couldn't complete assembly , because i couldn't find tool handle quick release hardware seat attachment . i take bike bike shop complete assembly . even bike shop problems this bike , because there so little clearance fenders tires . i watched while they bend sides back fender out hand , so it wouldn't rub tire . when i got bike home , first thing i adjust seat correct height , take it out ride . within 10 seconds seat slipped all way down . quick release handle can't hold seat place weight rider it ( i'm not heavy ) . chrysler should taken retro design step farther this , drilled holes seat stem rod insert adjust seat height . rather than try dis- assemble this box it up return it ... i check see if i drill seat stem myself get seat secured ridable height . its too bad they couldn't come up workable design such essential part bike seat height adjustment ! points i give here otherwise sturdy frame , tires work well unpaved trails ... when i finally ride this .	-1

" if you never owned wiffle ball , you've never really alive , my dear friend ! although they tend crack oblong cutouts after some time ( especially if you hang too many curveballs my brother who swings great authority ) , they last countless hours baseballesque bliss excellent exercise ! they used anywhere outdoors because wiffle ball weighs only two-thirds ounce , if doug never knocked one through window , neither you ! although wiffle ball light , it not follow it should taken lightly . after san francisco giant ( man , i hate giants ! ) , kevin mitchell won 1989 national league mvp award , he publicly stated he really learned hit curveball playing lot wiffle ball previous off-season . one greatest hitters all-time , san diego padre , tony gwynn used hit wiffle balls off batting tee because he could tell spin where he struck ball . play wiffle ball you're big league company ! wiffle balls offered here regulation 9 inch variety . ( surprise ! they're still made u.s.a. day production moves communist china i'll jump . ) twelve wiffle balls currently going $14.95 , that only $1.25 per ball . you any idea how much fun you wiffle ball ? well , take my word it , you'll get more than dollar twenty-five cents worth ! now all you need get regulation , old school , plastic yellow ( " banana " ) bat . course , if you really want splurge you purchase newly invented aluminum wiffle ball bat . funny story : my dear ol ' ma bought aluminum wiffle ball bat gift my brother his birthday . but she wasn't sure what size get , so she called company .

" one great disappointments my life ( seriously ! ) they didn't think organize wiffle ball competitions until doug i our 40 . we scouted out competition " wiffle ball world series " here phoenix few years ago . ( players fly all over country ! ) we figured even our advanced age my arthritis , we could still give those young studs all they bargained more , if we polished our long-neglected technique over next year . alas , it never happened , what work , life , all other crap gets way wiffle ball play . but doesn't mean you can't fly into phoenix next year win title ! get it , man ! get yourself dozen wiffle balls , " banana " bat start practicing . hint : ball breaks direction solid half . want throw drop ? make sure solid section bottom your release point . then get inventive ; there innumerable variations theme ! you thank me hint when you see me . you'll recognize me because i'm always guy who picks up suitcase comes around airport luggage carrousel plastic yellow bat strapped across top it !	1

i am writing this review primarily let people know what expect this product , since amazon/toys us don't seem clue - even image provided thoughtful customer . i bought this in-store toys us because sizing information not available online ( except size box , some bizarre reason ) i didn't want take chance getting wrong size . so let me share information you - this helmet suitable head sizes 20.5 " 22 " . i think overall this great set , but i marked it down point because it not include elbow protection . my own experience learning skate or even snowboard , i say i would generally fall onto my knees or heels my hands , so knee pads wrist guards would perfect me . but young child who knows ?! this my neice ( i am not parent ) whilst i am generally happy set it , i think it would nice include elbow protection ( which afterall available other sets , but not appear available separately ) make complete safety package . perhaps we supposed buy extra set so we elbow pads two sets knee pads , or perhaps i am touch too cynical	-1
bowflex replacement one older models(original , schwinn)that my husband used consistently 12 years . it came one huge box , took two us half day put together . directions diagrams pretty clear . one piece broken , but they sent out new one within week it now complete . they changed power-rod holder , so we can't salvage most old ones . my husband figure out way position two 50-lb rods into new slots so he could use more resistance . it not compact older model , but it fold up somewhat . overall , he very pleased this purchase -- we paid less this one through amazon than we 1995	1

this excellent product certain needs . it unmatched ease transport ( i easily carry four them once ) . only drawback these tables limited how much weight they hold . this makes perfect sense , course . if they sturdier , they would heavier . common sense approach usage -- place heavier objects toward ends legs rather than middle hinge -- insure safety longevity product . all all , very good value	-1

this pedometer easy set up use . i tested its accuracy local highschool track walking 1/2 mile , sure enough , my pedometer read 1/2 mile . clip sturdy , i haven't any problem device falling off . leash good extra - if it fall off , it wouldn't hit ground . my doctor gave me goal 10,000 steps per day , so i wear this all day long . it light i don't notice i am wearing it throughout day . only downfall this device ( probably true others)is your stride measured walking , so when you running or doing other cardio activity ( elliptical ) it doesn't accurately measure your distance . since your stride longer during cardio activity ( running ) , device measuring your walking stride , distance measurement falls short . however , actual number steps taken still accurately measured . i suppose you could adjust setting running stride when running bridge this gap	-1

i laugh people who think any final fantasy replica sword wieldable . 1)it " china " stamped one side . since really cheap things come china , this piece stainless steel . high carbon steel more expensive than stainless steel . high carbon steel obviously lot carbon which atracts moisture causes rust , pitting , corrosion . stainless steel softer because there less carbon it , thus preventing rust , pitting , corrosion . 2 ) this sword too massive wield . any skilled martial artist easily defeat someone who tries wield it . any hardwood weapon such bokken , tonfa , staff , even nunchaku break weapon . 3 ) since this sword long heavy , it really only two easy modes slashing : vertical horizontal . if someone tried attack vertically , it blocked weapon , or doged either causing sword get stuck ground or damaged . when opponent move attack . if slashing horizontally , chances it swung somewhat hard fast . opponent easilly dodged it or block attack . 4 ) even high carbon " battle ready " sword not last long if struck against sword . if hard sword hit against something equal hard or harder it break . there reason why sword never slashed against tree . sword play seen movies purely show . swords used either : rubber , plastic , or thick stage steel . samurai tried never draw their sword unless it absolutly nessacery .

i've several " fat " swiss army knives over years , this my favorite . highlights me three things : screwdriver socket set , pliers , pull out pen . ( i also like option get this knife blue . i so used red ones i glad change ) . first , regarding screwdriver socket pieces , they pretty well made , tiny spring loaded bearing middle . this means when you plug pieces into socket they sort lock , won't drop out when you trying use them . 4 socket bits double sided ( separate driver head each side ) . they contains 3 different sizes phillips heads , 3 hex heads ( weird , but useful off chance you need them ) , 1 octagon head ( basically " blank " ) , 1 regular screwdriver head . ( keep mind knife set also contains standard screwdriver options well , so explains why only 1 socket regular screwdriver . you also get tiny screwdriver which stored within corkscrew , larger one flips out back knife ) . second , cool set pliers . they relatively thick , so actually some use , most swiss army knives don't come this feature . third , tiny pen which you separate knife entirely . i keep this knife my car , many occasions i don't pen lying around , i grab this one help me out . finally , i am quite pleased this set not contain usb drive like some other new swiss army knives . this might initially entertaining , but 6 months it going so outdated you going wish you plain old knife ! ( imagining trying give this knife your kid 10 years . dad , what this weird thing knife ? )great stocking stuffer	1

i recently ordered this watch amazon companion ltt observer wear field . while observer more updated model they both share very similiar features ease operation . my first recommendation you order this amazon.com wary same item offered " market place sellers " . time i initially placed order amazon.com out wait estimated 3 5 weeks . since item also offered seller amazon referral system i placed order wound up wrong watch ; turns out market place seller didn't carry black face model . fortunately amazon got supply shipped my watch within 24 hours .... good service . black face little hard come . now then , watch itself . first all it big ... but very light ; almost light titanium observer i . larger face makes it easier read suunto apparently gone back leather ( waterproof ) band , which i prefer . functionally , watch full blown time keeper ( non gps ) navigation system including stop watch/chronometer functions , accurate altimeter , barometer digital compass . both compass altimeter accurate i've found analog portable units . alarms sufficiently loud ( unlike only chink observer ) my only criticism back light weak compared observer , but fault doesn't draw anything away 5 star rating . add user replaceable battery ( suunto makes kit includes battery , water/dust seal new cap ) , intuitive operating system you ultimate back country time piece . suunto first offer this type time piece , my opinion , still offers best . i've used their diving computers field compasses years am fan company many products . i don't think there clunker catalog	1

i love cathe friedrich workouts . she energetic encouraging , but not too much so ( think denise austin ... i just can't take level perky ) . plus , her workouts don't pull any punches--they're designed challenge you push you challenge yourself . i regularly several other cathe friedrich workouts ( muscle endurance , pyramid upper lower body , supersets ) . i love them all variety , but i think muscle max my favorite . it 68 minutes complete workout -- upper body , lower body , core , barbell , dumbells , resistance band . you get it all . ( you don't need barbell , however . all exercises dumbells alone . ) better yet , you choose what you want . dvd comes " premixed " workouts loaded . if you don't time 68-minute full workout , you 42-minute upper body , 23-minute lower body , or 53-minute " time saver . " or you go " mix match " section choose your own specific exercises entire dvd . " mix match " section its drawbacks -- it takes while dvd switch out program , into menu , back into program , which makes this most inconvenient options . however , it great if you want match up one premixed workouts core workout , or if you just time one small group exercises ( say , triceps . ) i love this dvd . it most comprehensive flexible strength training workout i've ever , i've bunch , including many firm series . i highly recommend this one .	1
this lightest , most reliable , most commonly used computer low end market ( $15-25 range ) . you're buying what everyone else ( which both good b/c tells you many consumers who some research agree your decision ; bad because , well , you're not hip individualistic , oh well ) . this cyclocomputer great what it . installation pretty dang easy even though instructions basic best ( really , just make sure sensor close enough magnet your spokes wires turn handlebars ) . if you're market device tell you how fast you've gone how far how long , this it . only negative comment i operation not intuitive , but instructions make it clear . really , this issue common all similar devices cateye mity 8 no better or worse than others . next step up similar model also measures " cadence " ( speed which pedals turn , measured revolutions per minute . inexperienced cyclists tend ride higher gears than they should , pedaling slower cadence ; experienced riders 70rpm range ) . again , cateye way go , expected , more features means higher cost . beyond devices include heart rate monitors . this great , but there substantial extra cost " gadget " factor . separate monitor may better ( like wrist )	1

i love this tennis racquet . it perfect blend power control . it great players able generate their own power , but looking little more control . balance little head heavy , but its not so heavy it tires out your arm . oversized head ( 110 sq . ) gives this racquet more sweet spot area . this great racquet groundstrokes volleys . i little more trouble controlling my serves . overall , i would recommend this racquet any player recreational level or competative level .	1

once you ditch fenders , decals , kickstand cheap plastic grips this pretty cool looking cruiser . frame nice glossy black seems solid but rest parts low quality . my front wheel arrived " tweaked " instance , but i'm sure this corrected . wheels look like really cheap chrome . seat bracket lousy , too . no matter how hard you tighten it , seat moves side side . this replaced . seat wide comfortable , though . would've liked matching black stem , black handlebars black rims but hey you can't everything . look elsewhere if you're stickler quality , but this bike should suit most people needs	-1

i usually love cathe workouts . i like this , but not much her others . this quite effective ( if you make it through end ) , but usually interval training , you pick up intensity lower it only pick it up again . here you pretty much going full tilt entire way . i don't really classify this interval training . said , you get great workout this . six circuits ( each three segments ) , you work balance , agility functional fitness . you need somewhat fit already order this because otherwise you find it very discouraging may quit . each segments within circuits step aerobics , floorwork standing toning . even she tell you if you don't lot space work ( cause you'll football drills ) then ' take it higher ' . so she one tough cookie , but she give you results if you this consistantly . you looking workout well over hour . but while it tough makes you sweat , i just wouldn't call it interval training . her instruction cuing good ever i think if you fit or somewhat fit already , you lot gain this . i really like it	-1

this my third heart rate monitor ; i decided upgrade model could upload workout data pc , this least expensive polar model ability . specialized versions double bicycle computers cost only little more , but i don't ride much anymore , my road bike already computer , so i decided those capabilities worth nothing me . pro : * s610i works . period . * " wearlink " chest strap more comfortable than other chest straps i used . * it comes logging training software , you upload performance data website run polar comparing friends . * it works either " sonic " or infrared connection your pc or pda . i use infared . transferring data one-hour workout takes only couple seconds , watch store many workouts uploads . * you set watch time , date , other variables pc , which much more convenient than trying program it buttons watch itself . * it easy get extra parts , so you keep heart-strap home , gym , example . * though i never competitive athlete , i find this monitor , knowledge it logs all my workouts , help me stay motivated . i work out harder more often , i feel watch looking over my shoulder , i don't want leave blank spot automatic training diary . anti : * watch software design terrible . you click buttons over over again get anything , it not always clear which button what effect . * documentation clearly not written native speaker english , many passages opaque . you end up figuring out how use features watch trial error . i failed log most my first workout entirely because bizarrely phrased directions how pause monitor . * watch garish looks silly suit . * software pc only doesn't seem export everything if you want analyze your heart rate data other software , or machine ( it export some information recorded , including heart rates , but not others , including time stamps or workout descriptions ) . * polar usb/infrared adapter , which costs extra , completely incompatible macintosh . you buy software analyze polar data mac , but you can't use this adapter move data over . instead , you need buy serial infrared adapter , usb-serial adapter , connect them together . this slower somewhat maddening . * if polar publish all apis make their drivers software open source , they wouldn't lose dime hardware sales , people who would able make much better software their monitors , running many more platforms	-1
