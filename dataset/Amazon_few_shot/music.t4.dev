there now no trace delight left this band . all songs either moderately slow somewhat self-indulgent or frightfully slow quite self-indulgent . i love this band pronounce praises upon them whenever i receive doe-eyed look saying their name , but this cd cd previous ( which 1 tune , " apples , " which one could smile ) , first time , take away any anticipation their next collection chopfallen tunes . first , we loose roses , then ned disband , following , swervedriver breaks apart velocity girl gone forevermore . now my charlatans become charlatans great band they once .	-1
i want this guy succeed so badly , yet he just couldn't pull it off . his voice great sound it , pleasant ears , yet his interpretation just not there . his phrasing very lazy boring most times . it seemed like he didn't know where start next word . he also sounded out breath . he sounded so out breath i started gasping air ... i stop listening . add , john vibrato sounded washed out faded places where it needed stronger . i truly hope age experience he improves . there no reason why he should not . he not catagory buble ' or connick jr. yet .	-1

i bought this soundtrack 1984 when movie adaptation george orwell book came out , simply because it attached movie . i'll try not use any non-family words here , but this soundtrack sucks . muldowney original score available cd , simply imagining it used intended adds whole new dimension movie . far this soundtrack goes , though ; skip it	-1
she doesn't sing ... she yells !!! using one ednita songs she " lo que son las cosas " just sacrilege its " best " ( or worst ) . it really easy hit it big your first single when song already classic itself . she absolutely nothing beyonce or cristina aguilera . her cd just plain bad ! if you want hear good music latin women beautiful powerful voices ( actually sing ) , you might want look la lupe , celia cruz , ednita nazario lucecita benitez ... these only ones i remembered moment	-1
i love every track ne-yo cd " my own words ! " next let me thank ne-yo bringing true rb back industry ! i dont consider songs cheating your bf/gf/husband/wife rb . rb supposed love - thats why people call them slow love songs . 2001 - 2005 new slow love songs didn't exist . i ended up listenin same songs da 90 over over until i got so tired them , fortunate lucky enough my radio station ( plays mostly rap : genre music i dont like ) play " so sick " ne-yo . it great song . this literally first only rb album i never urge use fast forward feature get next song ! ne-yo lyrics strictly romantic sweet too ! he lyrical genius . his voice soothing melodic . most rb albums obviously rap tracks or rushed rb songs filler probably meet deadline or get cd out fast possible reducing enjoyability cd , but this album all songs great . all tracks this album great , but here ones superb : 1 . so sick - 9/10 ( would 10 if it wasn't played over over so many different versions . although i still listen it over over2 . when you're mad - 9/10 ( those guys who like look girls faces when they get mad . maybe michelle rodriguez fans . :) ) 3 . get down like 10/10 ( both versions ) ( i call it " dont get down like " ) ( this song guys completely faithful like me ) ( if you're not player , proud faithful , this da song you)4 . sexy love - 10/10 ( great song . um hmmm .. what i say this one its lyrics ?.... oh yes .... this song guys who girl when she touches them , it just feels like .... magic . ) this da only cd dat ever deserved 5 stars me , only reason i gave other rb albums 5 stars cuz i took into consideration : there no rb album existed nothing but good tracks , most poorly upbeat song	1
unless you frequented jazz clubs baltimore or philly fall 1955 , this would your first exposure miles davis-john coltrane collaboration ( few tracks recorded columbia , label miles would soon joining exclusively , few weeks before this session weren't issued until much later ) . davis settled coltrane his replacement departing sonny rollins almost default - no one else fit bill or new book . they would stay together long seemed unlikely because their temperaments differed so much ( davis hands-off leader , coltrane wanted constant input miles his playing music general ) . stablemates ( benny golson tune ) track seems draw most attention . it excellent composition , although coltrane sounds somewhat tentative ( nervous ? ) , performance attractive . but my favorite side there no greater love , even though coltrane sits this one out : miles plays beautifully , i love emotion he wrings tune . true , this early effort group would transform modern jazz , but it very good session nonetheless . group plays well , rhythm section rock solid , they all off running . full speed ahead	1

deutsche grammophon united all abbado mendelssohn recordings london symphony orchestra this inexpensive 4 cd set . without question , abbado mendelsson symphony cycle , recorded mid 1980 , remains among best . highlights include splendid performances 2nd , 4th 5th symphonies , others almost fine , abbado opting brisk tempi emphasizing scores ' broad orchestral textures . splendid surprise inclusion orchestrated version scherzo minor octet ( opus 20 ) , which mendelssohn regarded alternative 3rd movement his first full-fledged symphony ( symphony no . 1 minor , opus 11 . ) . other works included this compilation include all mendelssohn overtures , most notably quot ; hebridesquot ; ( opus 26 ) , overture shakespeare quot ; midsummer night dreamquot ; ( opus 21 ) . sound quality quite superb , though may bit dry comparison recordings made vienna philharmonic concert hall . avid fans abbado mendelssohn music surely want acquire this collection	1

my first exposure general public came 1984 . i listening original wktu radio new york city this song called " tenderness " came then . time , this radio station " disco/dance " radio station new york . what i distinctly remember this station it very different song than dance numbers typically played this station . nonetheless , this song caught my attention well attention many other fans . it turns out this true " crossover " song group general public . it part collection ten songs could easily fall into " crossover " 80s/techno-pop category general public debut album " all rage " . mid 1980s , term " supergroup " became very popular . supergroup basically group or project whose primary members other successful bands . two most common supergroups power station mike + mechanics . before either or these supergroups , there supergroup called general public . when english beat disbanded , vocalists dave wakeling ranking roger decided form new band . they recruited keyboardist micky billingham drummer andy " stoker " growcott dexy midnight runners . also recruited bassist horace painter ( " specials " ) guitarist kevin white . both english beat dexy midnight runners produced most unique 80s pop sound almost become synonymous decade itself . make no mistake this , sounds both these groups alive well this " alliance " . lot ways formation this alliance results so much more than " 80s music " . here quick synopsis album song song : " hot you're cool " : this might not deepest song terms lyrics , but there lot more than just 80s sound this particular track . there some terrific saxophone work makes melody so terrific . " tenderness " : this signature song group . there lot reasons this became signature song . you hear wakeling roger trademark vocals , - but you hear contributions just everyone band . i think billingham keyboards , painter bass , white guitar deserve lot credit . justine carpenter background vocals ( i.e. " where ... " ) make this song so special . mentioned above , this crossover song - although i see it more dance song . " anxious " : although not strongest track , here track breaks 80s mold . this song features brass section some trumpet trombone helps distinguish it many other 80s tracks . " never you " : this second single released this album . here song definitely walks tightrope rock dance music . this pretty good track more you hear it , more you want hear it . " burning bright " : this second best song behind " tenderness " . i am very surprised this song didn't get more airplay . this song opens some outstanding guitar light keyboard overtone . " stoker "' drumming strongest this track . there 1 minute introduction . this isn't much 80s techno-pop track others , but much more progressive rock sound . this song lines " moscow monterey maine mexico " printed back cd . " matter fact " : i don't think this strongest track , but it isn't bad track . this song moves back toward techno-pop sound much more dance music feel it . " stoker " shines here again some nice drum work here . " you leading me " : lyric melody standpoint - this song starts out classic 80s techno-pop feel it . 90 seconds into song there terrific reggae sequence nice change pace . general public finds great way integrate reggae into song they switch gears flawlessly . " day day " also starts classic 80s feel it . unlike " you leading me " , it doesn't switch gears . it sticks classic 80s feel . i would say this weakest track collection . " where line " : terrific mix 80s music carribean twist . this very catchy song one good dance floors . vocals top form once again horns find their way into track . " general public " : i think its great when group names after song after themselves ( or names group after song ) . this song perfect wrap-up song . it mix some theatrical qualities very european sound . this song too pretty catchy . liner notes contain all lyrics all songs . all participating musicians listed credits well some production credits . one drawback liner notes lyrics credits put into 6 thin columns per page . result small fonts very difficult read . following this debut album , general public subsequent albums would never achieve success this debut album both commercial or critical standpoint . much this due fact late 80s early 90s , music landscape would change move away synth-pop more natural rock sound . however , this more than just 80s album - there some real talent this collection . you get so much more than song " tenderness " . i highly recommend this collection	1
i'm big fan bowie , iggy , . rex other bands glam/early punk era . this album provides perfect mix those genres . it really hard listen this album not hear how their influence spread lot bands would proceed them . there really isn't anything i say this album hasn't said already . if you like bands i mentioned above , this must addition your collection	1
i'm long time belle sebastian fan , i've listening them since tigermilk , i just cannot get enough this album . it my favourite album theirs date , it also very best album i've heard so far this year . it takes all elements made this band so wonderful over years : witty lyrics , bacharach-esque melodies ; but there new sense humor fun , even some funky 70 glam rock swagger boot . it most fun album i've heard ages , it just makes me want get up sing dance . amazing band so known it retro mod sound come out one freshest sounding albums year .	1
fact not good all .. i really don't like good charlotte .. i don't own this cd , my brother . almost all songs singer feeling sorry himself , whining how miserable he . lyrics very , very simple . " hold " supposed song against suicide , but i find it totally unbelievable , when theres song cd called " day i die " , where he sings happiest his life he dies . i think he mentions death some other songs too . so maybe he not miserable , or " hold " just attempt gain more popularity heroic . it really makes no sense . i'm giving this cd 1 star because i really think it bad . not because i think " real punk " " classic rock " only good music , you should buy instead ( that just stupid ) . there lot great alternatives this cd . but there also lot bands this genre , almost bad good charlotte . comparing this blink 182 insane . blink 182 makes great melodies clever lyrics	-1
perhaps no musical group exemplified anti-counter cultural approach music better than band various ways . they influenced many people who influential their own right either time ( eric clapton george harrison approach music ) or would years come ( i.e. roger waters ' approach concept album writing pink floyd ) not mention one begetters 1970 style " folk country . " while more could said them than , there plenty say this album where review focused . album opens " across great divide " it sets tone very down home americana feel this album full uniformly excellent songs . latter song contains story man who tries explain himself his woman recounts some extent recklessness his " younger days " he tries persuade her not kill herself . it not grim it sounds words i assure you . second song " rag mama rag " which fun quirky song fiddles , offbeat drum pattern , mandolin , fiddle instead bass , bass parts played tuba . lyrics song woman who only wants play ragtime music ... there may sly message but whatever . brings us one best songs album . " night they drove old dixie down " musically lyrically masterpiece . it ironic canadian songwriter ( jaime robbie robertson ) could write such empathetic tune old south but it power song cannot denied . it delivered conviction only american group ( southerner levon helm ) . garth hudson gets some very textural sounds melodica overdubbed via his lowrey organ , which sounds like harmonica starting second verse song . it example multifaceted talents band members -all whom except robbie robertson played multiple instruments . i never get tired hearing this song , singing it , or playing it guitar . it followed " when you awake " , song lyrics family remembering grandfatherly advice given . there album moves " up cripple creek " which song very " back porch " feel which ( i must say it ) deliciously sleazy way . garth hudson playing clavinet through wah wah pedal create sound jew harp . when mixed danko bass playing , it gives significantly low range tune narrative man who wants lookup old girlfriend " assistance " if you how many areas she completes him . " whispering pines " follows , which robertson co-wrote richard manuel . song completely different tempo than one preceding it manuel delivers very wrenching vocal performance vocally piano . following " whispering pines " " jemima surrender " which heavier tempo boogie-woogie piano ( played not manuel but hudson ) , manuel drums , levon helm not drums but rhythm guitar , robertson lead guitar . ( alternate take -- half songs album alternative take this cd- members their usual instruments completely different approach song . ) song singer wanting girl named jemima give ... well ... all i tell you it . " rocking chair " possibly my favourite song album . it unconventional musically group there no drums ( helm mandolin this tune ) , hudson plays accordion , robertson acoustic guitar , timekeeping solely danko bass adequate . lyrics i find quite haunting now wake lost my childhood best friend last year other reasons not mentioned here . " look out cleveland " up tempo rocker sung danko some aggressive lead fills robertson backed danko equally aggressive bass picking " storm coming through " which ends up devastating everything . ( compared everything else album , this song stands out its strident phrasing . ) there next song " jawbone " it opens very slow start alternates time signatures verses pre-chorus chorus back again lyrics thief who unrepentant . album next moves into " unfaithful servant " which sung danko slow creeper ... well ... exactly what title says narrator tries examine reason faithlessness involved . album ends officially " king harvest " which frantic tune sung manuel . song unusual sound even album songs many which distinctive sense . shifting tempos verse verse gives distinctive sound robertson stinging lead playing which shows pleasing restraint it . lyrics show tensions paradoxical attachments ( city country , past present , etc ) tale union man who feeling pinch ala steinbeck " grapes wrath " wraps up album quite strongly . there also alternate takes six songs cd release well outtake song would appear future albums ( referring " get up jake " ) . but twelve songs album originally released focus this review they all cohere well making this album must anyone who likes good music .	1

wow !! awesome !! rhino it again . rhino records always puts out great anthologies . i remember growing up 60 these musicals always playing television saturday afternoon . i thank my mom . i remember most these tunes i can't wait order this . it took some time search it out amazon . congratulations !! you won't find collection good this . it closest you get owning best hollywood musicals without buying every soundtrack . if you remember lazy days family couch singing judy garland , fred astaire , gene kelly , this collection should hit spot . i agree , this collection needs more bing crosby . but i disagree it needs some sinatra . ( even though i love town guys dolls . ) there plenty great sinatra recordings own ( i 12 ) , but these recordings rare . man , they make room clark gable . what great choice . but never fear sinatra fans , maybe rhino box set . one only hope . " forget your troubles , come get happy . " if you remember when hollywood could sing , you get this . enjoy .	1

pinback blows me away . i consider my taste music very diverse , tendency love obscure indie rock-pop , last three decades ( talk talk , split enz elliot smith death cab ) . pinback delivers some best , most consistent music i've heard years . i started summer abaddon weak knees , then i acquired their debut album could barely stand ... now , blue screen life knocked breath right out me . i haven't gotten through entire back catalog because i can't stop listening three albums i my hands . words cannot express how fascinating this band - intricate complicated simple , straightforward delivery . their transitions sick . they put their contemporaries ( death cab , shins , killers ) shame . i love all aforementioned bands , but pinback slaughters them delivering well conceived , perfectly executed , diversified albums you listen front back , over over . how many albums you say ? they heavenly . standouts xiy , boo , concrete seconds , bbtone , prog , pene ... oh , screw it - every song great !	1

disclaimer : i give sound quality musicianship five stars this album . set list way some non-pj songs seem disconnected overall feel album what brings it overall three stars , though still recommended . avid pearl jam fan who listened nearly everything they've ever published recorded music realm , i again couldn't wait get my hands this live acoustical album ... sometimes simply known musical circles " unplugged " . album features few their classics like " girl " " daughter " well many covers , like dylan " masters war " . unplugged cd like this , you get hear band almost more true folk/spiritual sounding set opposed arena rocker . venue , benaroya hall , what i " hear " this album , superb place record live performance ( especially acoustic one , vedder voice almost echoes , but doesn't , it just enough give it more far reaching " boom " opposed falling flat through crowd which sometimes happen recording such this . thankfully , this not case ; it one best sounding live albums i've ever heard ! because i love sounds , could tell whatever this place obviously place when recording " unplugged " album , i some research it . i'll give you basics short but informative way . 1 ) benaroya hall opened up 1998 seattle state-of-the-art performance hall . it home seattle symphony . 2 ) state art facility designed music mind course . i mentioned before , vedder voice really comes through clear strong . hall made multitude angles well panels nooks disperse diffuse pitch sound it travels wavelength . physics this course , gives us much more quality music ... it enhanced million times better than if say , they playing stage middle basketball gymnasium . now you familiar how great sound science behind it , it time move my opinion this album . first off , set list . when i first listened it i enthralled hearing some my favorite songs . acoustical album it still felt like powerful music , vedder crew really sound like , usual , they putting their heart soul into playing their instruments delivering message or theme song portrays . i went later into album , i started feel little lost . several songs i never heard seemed suck some energetic feel i their classics right outta air ! it song , way they played song or their attitude general ? i think latter not apply , but former mentioned rings true . some these songs may seem like something band should play ( like " masters war " " i believe miracles " ) however , often i felt like band wasn't benaroya hall anymore , they regular stage singing cover songs . band me simply not seem evoke same energy or spirit they their own music . now , saying , maybe because their music just , something came their heart , mind , soul , not someone else , why i feel somewhat disenfranchised non-pj songs this album . continuing objective , i would liked see couple more their own songs , whether they hits or lesser known tunes , each disk . i think me it would made it little more pearl jam . however , fan , i ultimately still enjoy this album , am impressed quality sound hall they play presents . there still parts this cd simply amazing , like way your heart feel heavier when hearing song " low life " " girl " . these tracks i never get tired hearing so i may biased there , but taking electronics electric guitars out picture never seems strip down bands talent but unveil stronger , richer sound all it own ! interaction crowd course more subtle than playing say , some place like miami or houston front 50,000 people . feeling crowd appreciative , but also special kind considering they doing album ( what i gather vedders intermittent speeches ) youth benefit charity . pearl jam never called sellouts or greedy rock stars , they often known participate things help their community , world , fellow man . " sleight hand " also gem here comes deep eddie now usual soothing , almost reaching out sorrow serious toned vocals . it uses usual theme one person vs . themselves others , invoking sad tones regret memory . there seems some electronic things going here there , so i am assuming unplugged means lead guitarists playing acoustics , or perhaps someone using pedal machine via acoustic banks . regardless , overall it sound quality hall makes up some songs i don't put up pedestal . there other pj sources live music ; however , i don't think you really go wrong this album . 24 tracks performed great venue one greatest american rock bands all time , how could you go wrong ?	1
it took me while ( not long , thankfully ) get into tilly wall ever since then i tapping my feet beat . their music , lyrics tapping refreshing answer today boring pop music . i would say they " indie pop " . if you looking some music sing ( loudly proudly ) car or get your mood up this cd . listen first track , if you like it than cd highly recommended since many their songs similar beats sounds . there some beautiful slow songs ( lost girl ) , but some people hard time getting use derek voice ( main guy voice ) since it rather soft scratchy . i chance see them live even though they entertaining then , it not justice shown this album . i high recommend this anyone looking dance , need mood lifter or just looking new kind band listen .	1

this your classic west coast , gangster , " ride my enemies " album dog pound gangster kurupt . takes you back death row days early 90 when kurupt , daz , snoop , rest dpg crew would smash anyone anything got their way ! kurupt shows off his vast rapping skills every track . besides kurupt , some west finest , such snoop , dr. dre , xzibit , daz , others pop up album . highlight song without dought " live mic " featuring hip-hop legend krs-one . no hook ; just straight freestylin ' , both rapper specialty . track worth second listen " callin ' out names " ( bonus track ) . this classic dis record direct dmx , foxy brown , murder inc ., 50 cent ! any fan west coast gangsta music should definitely pick up this one .	1
well i'm 17 years old probably got into hip-hop around age 13 , so you say i never grew up greats like 2pac , biggie , etc . not until i heard this cd i could really appreciate hip-hop . sure radio ok but when i heard this i realized how much hip-hop lacking today , what happened ?? using skip track button my cd player isn't necessary , whole cd really classic me . it not just genius beats i impressed , but lyrics . lyrics ... wow , genius ... no other way describe it . i plan exploring many other areas hip-hop i never knew exisited . i wish hip-hop how it back early 90 , it lacks something today . you no longer " nod " ur head rap music radio .	1
not like this album all . poorly written musically failure . no wonder this guy trashes other artists	-1
alright , so main reason i got soundtrack pistolero juno reactor , real driving , pumped-up techno song . i started get into rest music soundtrack , i find it essential cd i carry me . great thing this soundtrack you listen mexican traditional music glimpse culture , still some real badass-sounding guitar ! whatever you may think film , you imagine actors playing their parts your head , since they play sing soundtrack ( first one ) . there aura music i can't put my finger ; there history , old feel it , but it lingers new musical ideas . kinda like movie , terms making it . i agree fullheartedly previous reviews : where movie fails , music fills gaps expands mexican music , making entire movie/soundtrack experience very deep epic . i dunno , maybe i'm rambling , but i emphasize this soundtrack adds culture kickass your collection , it mine	1

this group assimilated all influences great rock music 1967 1972 come up modern vision . everyone frank zappa quicksilver messenger service morgen guess who procol harum yes(plus hundreds others ) touched upon this eclectic recording then stretched almost jazzlike sound . i call it pure genius if any above mentioned bands your idea great music then i highly recommend this all their other recordings . too bad there no other bands mining this territory , but i'm sure glad these guys !	1

i only recently encountered this opera , acquired rattle recording few weeks ago , since , also bought listened naxos recording . fact may indicate i consider this little-known opera major find -- sumptuous , passionate , work i return many times , i am sure , would love see produced . i decided comment here because i really cannot agree either earlier comments . it probably true polish speaker would find hampson singing language bit uncomfortable -- i am not competent judge . but his singing , i always find it , sensitive intelligent , though he not throw himself into characterization ( andrzej hiolski naxos set ) , he projects clear sense dramatic conflict confronted king roger . i also cannot concur condemnation szmytka roxana . her voice light but well-controlled she manages negotiate vocal line effectively . true , it would interesting hear , example , renee fleming role , but i find this roxana completely satisfying . ( barbara zagorzanka , naxos set , bigger broader voice , but very wiry upper register -- i don't object it , but her sound also not kind warm , sensuous quality seems desired . ) i would agree tenor singing shepherd not outstanding ( but neither corresponding role naxos disk , though tenor stronger overall . ) whole , this recording powerful beautiful introduction superb opera . i think most opera lovers would find it much more than satisfactory	1
i bought this cd because i figured i couldn't go wrong isaac stern . i right . playing this cd taut powerful , crackling energy . same time , though , players keep superior sense musical precision , manage make music sound energetic without sounding heavy-handed . gramophone would say , it not without irony * felix * mendelssohn composed works such * felicity * , these performers keep felicity intact , which sets this cd way above myriads other mendelssohn piano trio recordings . ten dollars especially , you can't go wrong . this cd every mendelssohnian should his or her collection	1
missing essential " out street " , still only available bloated " river " 2 disc set . instead , includes tedious , unnecessary ubiquitous " 41 shots " , left-wing tirade against nypd one-time , nearly forgotten tragedy	1
unlike many reviewers , i enjoyed howie day previous release , " australia , " but i also found it inconsistent . " stop all world now " avoids sounding somewhat inconsistent ( hey even coldplay improved since their somewhat inconsistent " parachutes ) . but i digress . " stop all world now " starts off strongly ends off strongly , filled tons passion throughout great acoustic rock fill . " brace yourself " amazing song lyrically range motions within it ... great opener album . " perfect time day " calypso-esque acoustic feel it interesting . " collide " song catapulted howie day up charts it easy see why ... this love song , but love song almost bittersweet too moments . lyrical quality , acoustic nature , 25 piece orchestra just make this song even stronger more amazing . " trouble here " great acoustic song piano really makes this song stronger " sing " even more . " sunday morning song " probably one song could drag this album down though it different . " i'll take you " different kind song but crescendo middle song just intensifies passionate lyrics . this one better songs album . " she says " harkens back " ghost " although it cannot supercede " ghost " , it still great acoustic song . " numbness sound " song builds this album , beginning off vocals very little instrumentation , but song progresses , it builds emotion power . yet one better songs album . " you promise " ... this my second favorite song album . lyrics tackle some very difficult issues like pregnancy but lyrics trascendental enough they apply any hard time relationship when promises made . great song vocals , lyrics , music . " end our days " song relationships but it also beautiful love song ... one better songs album . " come lay down " would my favorite song entire album ... lyrics convey beckoning feeling , feeling protection . instruments vocals perfect well help create mood flying . " this time around " perfect song follow " come lay down " great lyrics . " standing sun " continues " flying " type mood course better songs album . acoustic versions " brace yourself " " collide " great end off because it strips howie day down his vocals just guitar ... fine way end off this amazing album	1
let me pull everyone aside honest minute . nook isn't very smart . i'm extremely attractive , uncanny fashion sense , am best cover band frontman ever my headband collection unparalleled , but i'm pretty freakin dumb . case , i don't get this band name . they aren't named thompson aren't twins . one them black . i'll sit down every third day try make sense it , but usual it leads me riding my bigwheel into busy intersection , stopping traffic until police arrive . it sad because music thompson twins , my opinion , most influential last 25 years . you hear their influence everyone nickelback . diddy other great artists today . why they pick such stupid name ? song 16 candles my favorite because i love movie . molly ringmall only hottest girl 80s . she breakfast club too ! song makes me think forgein kid yao ming , who just stole movie anthony michael jackson . anyway , thompson twins awesome i am too	1
not much say this compilation . all goth hit miss , but this compilation fair content . very different spectrums this album . most tracks organic , which whats wrong all other unquiet grave compilations . newer material , more electronic dissonant . volume 1 very retro goth feel it ... like some these songs could pouring out dark , evil goth club heart city . i'm not going review material b/c i believe style music speaks its self . i say if you looking variety , look no further . bells , organs , guitars , sitars , harps , violins , synthesizers ... all present . haunting female vocals , low thundering gothy male vocals ... they present too . perfect music halloween party held dusty old mausoleum ... enjoy this compilation this coming fall ... happy samhain	1
yeah , you saw right . i gave this album 5 stars , you know why ? kick ass . i've it two weeks it playing non-stop ( driving my roommate crazy ! ) . course this album spawned " bizzare love triangle " so why even write review without mentioning it ? also " all day long , " i like one too . then there paradise . i'll agree dude who said " paradise " greatest song this record- it dark , kind creepy , , well , you'd know if you heard it . i'm freaking obsessed this song . it really sad 80 get overlooked modern times ( unless it become adult contempoary hit ; think sting ) . you really hear their influence anything motion city soundtrack no doubt killers ( who totaly ripped off new order- right down their name , stolen music video " crystal . " don't get me wrong- i like them lot ) , tons other music , especially dance . vive la 80 	1

ok theres only like 4 good songs this cd : megalomanic , pistola , sick sad little world zee deevel . rest songs slow void interest , theres nothing really takes off . its slow more mainstreamed approach rock . i love other two incubus cds i : make yourself morning view but this one just doesnt sit right me . if you like other two cds you may not like this , you warned but if you like soft jazz rock which never really lifts off ground feel like sleeping bring your pillow cd player this cd drift off sleep . btw ( look your face after reading this review ' priceless '	-1
spinal tap returns ! most prolific nonexistant band ever back " break like wind , " wonderfully warped metal album celebrates rock'n'roll , bad lyrics exploding drummers . this bad album -- gloriously , magnificently bad , way only spoof . it opens roaring male dominance rocker " bitch school , " which would offensive if it weren't tongue-in-cheek , then lurches wonderfully bloated " majesty rock , " gloriously ghastly duet cher , insanely pretentious " sun never sweats " ( " bolder than pirates who used rule sea/braver than natives , who never heard tea ... " ) peak this album may song " break like wind , " which aspires deep inspirational despite lyrics like " we thumb stranger hand . " two most priceless songs end : mope ballad " all way home , " truly twisted christmas song , " christmas devil . " world first introduced spinal tap " this spinal tap , " classic rockumentary england loudest band . help cher ( yes , cher ) dweezil zappa , they take it upon themselves roundly mock metal , hard rock , rock ballads , quite few other things well -- they're funny because they put so much effort into doing nudge-wink bad job . music itself pretty standard hard rock riffs -- it merely okay , therein lies irony . what really startling while music not amazing technical sense , it actually much better than many real-life bands . scary , no ? it its moments brilliance , due zappa jeff beck mostly , well some gloriously ghastly sitar . it not music but lyrics genius . michael mckean , christopher guest , harry shearer true geniuses bad song -- what even better , these sort bad songs people write , but don't know they bad . " that majesty rock ! /the mystery roll ! /the darning sock , /the scoring goal ! " it get worse than ? yes , if you include lines like " rise ! you cream " " we may gods or big marionettes/but sun never sweats .

i would recommend buying any banhart albums . you could debate which better , but they all so good it hardly matters . his music original , sometime sounds poetic , silly , psychotic or all three . you could name any number influences , but his work really just it own thing .	1
first thing realize this 4 cd set ..... king phil ! no other grateful dead cd phil bass boom out so forcefully ... rattling windows shaking walls . if you're debating closing winterland ... should i buy dvd or cds ? my opinion , it far more enjoyable buy cds just hear music without visuals . cd 1 , highlights scarlet begonias fire mountain , both tracks long , excellent jerry jams . cd 2 you get very very good playing band ... terrapin station better than very over-produced studio track . cd 3 gives you extremely loose not fade away ... maybe it bit too loose ... harmonica solos some guitar solos not jerry ... but throughout jam , phil king deep bass satisfaction booming daylights out your sub-woofer ( if you sub woofer ) . cd 4 relatively short dark star/other one/dark star ... but it well worth hearing . all all , closing winterland essential any dead collection . fun , you always listen funny introduction cd 1 first track , dan aykroid " burning ember " happy new year countdown	1
i feel like crying right now , literally . i suppose i saw this coming , even though i'd give anything avoid it : goo goo dolls straight up sold out , no other band could dissapoint me more than they could . goo goo dolls sole band brought me through my teens , probably single most early influence my taste music . no other band intensity , musically emotionally , these guys captured their earlier albums ( albums like jed , hold me up , superstar carwash , or boy named goo all you who started dizzy ) . complete lack words describe feeling certain song gives you -- you know what i'm talking about- these guys it everything they . it , past tense . their progression critics tote " maturing , " alas , dolls slow descent into what they've become now . we ( longtime fans ) saw it silently groaned ourselves , not able admit ourselves it happening . it started dizzy up girl ( what , or five singles ? get serious ) . don't get me wrong , i enjoy album , but only because it still some magic made goo goo dolls what they . songs still felt real . gutterflower real omen ; but least songs still somewhat interesting , musically . so it comes this , great band ruining itself . trust me , i tried desperately like this cd . desperately . but it doesn't feel real . lyrics cheesy . musicianship way below par ( compard their creative ability talent ) . songs forgetable all sound same . only song i found somewhat enjoyable " listen . " ( only taste real ggd i could find this cd ) . ( only two songs robby vocals ? its shame . his raspy voice beautiful . ) its hurts me immensely say these things john robby . they've my idols more than half my life . it feels like part me dead . sounds cheesy , but ggd never dissapointed me . time face up facts : they finally . i guess all good things come end.so if you want hear some good music , go used cd store pick up superstar carwash , hear what this really great band used sound like .	-1
ok , first off i am sick debating whats " punk " what isn't " punk " . i like simple plan but i like other bands lot heavier .. like nile , cradle filth , lots others . this cd kind pathetic but i don't really care .. i just like catchy lyrics . labels pretty stupid band when you think it , i mean if media would not started calling this band punk , then there you wouldn't called poser listening them . simple plan said over over again they not punk band but won't stop everyone else because stupid , stupid , stupid , media	1

don't let whole " collection eps " thing scare you ; you don't need obsessive belle sebastian fan enjoy this album . it two cds solid material , quite bit better ( my opinion ) than their other albums i've heard . eps blend together well , offering songs rollicking subdued . most them catchy weirdly fun ... who doesn't need more ?	1
more acoustic folk-oriented than led zeppelin previous two efforts , but not lacking attitude or craft . slightly underrated ( if you'd consider certified 6x platinum album underrated ) , but still well . though not absolute essential like led zeppelin 4 , led zeppelin 3 excellent piece work worth your time money	1
truth i so transfixed visuals soundtrack movie didn't enter my consciousness . it superlative vedder/nasrat fateh ali khan duets radio drew me this fabulous compilation . truth also while knowing pearl jam , i'd never given eddie more than glancing attention . ali khan i'd heard since mid 1980s . their singing this cd compelling . then there challenge set song champs tim robbins write their impressions roughcut film . dividends aren't quite so great . springsteen , michelle shocked , susan vega , mary chapin carpenter , my favourite here , lyle lovett , all returned wonderful material . lovett pure diction phrasing ensures enunciating failed promises , failed words , cuts deep . springsteen sets mood fairly literal condensing film narrative . i consider it stronger than anything , ' tom joad ' . springsteen voice assembles sean penn screen face me , so carpenter erect susan saradons ' . star cast emerge collectively absorbing material , though none quite match vedder(who later bob dylan cbs bash , stole show ' masters war)and ali khans '	1

last reviewer , this album should not compared sting " nothing like sun " or " dream blue turtles " . it sting move different direction , move started " brand new day " . it more techno , " smooth good way " sting , which , my opinion , wise step . " dream " " sun " terrific albums ? yes . should sting making sequels them now ? no . " brand new day path " good musical evolution sting . " sacred love " itself , it very fine album . traks such " inside " , " dead man rope " , " book my life " standouts , but whole album sounds like cohesive whole . it superior " brand new day " sting stays away rap country tendencies evident " brand " . this said , really great tracks album ( " thousand years " , " desert rose " , " ghost story " title track ) , most part , better than great songs " sacred love " . what makes " sacred love " better it more album than " brand " . songs form suite instead just seperate tracks . basic point : buy " sacred love " if you like " brand new day " sting . if you love " turtles " " sun " , " sacred love " may not best choice you	1
' 1999 ' funky , fresh , very catchy .... he got some pop-friendly cuts like ' 1999 ' ' little red corvette ' impossible not love ... then he got some crazy ' out there ' but infectious songs like ' automatic ' ' all critics love you ny ' ' lady cab driver ' .... course clever balad " international lover " .... although i too young ( i might not even born yet ) remember those days , i think general consensus this album propelled prince super-star status solidified his position one most creative unique musicians his time , or any time period matter ...	1
much band professional career , corrs fallen outside bounds " irish pop , " where they've so often lumped , more area pop musicians who happen irish . but " home , " family band makes giant leap into ireland musical tradition without ever losing its unique pop sound . while sound pop , music this time around largely traditional . crossover works brilliantly , turning classic old irish songs into tracks would go over quite well any pop music radio station or dance floor . album conceived tribute late jean corr , siblings ' mother , who musician avid collector songs before she died 1999 . what more i say ? traditional irish songs given exciting new spin one ireland top pop family bands success written all over it . any luck , it bring new listeners into traditional fold -- encourage corrs explore more deeply their rich family legacy national treasure .	1

grand majesty carnegie hall , name , fame , quitessential respect . heir angry comedy finds his throne respectable stage last . i bought this album because it required buy his albums soon they hit stores when you own funny bone . i am also desperate after memorizing every bill hicks album i own . this isn't bite lewis , though , he funny mofo all his self . very outset , lewis black seems think he obliged explain why he there carnegie . he goes straight through factors his conception his influential jewhood . this seems very boring beginning , relaying his history , but i guess that mid-life combined playing famous opera house he says he dreamed playing when he started . entire two discs easily constitute , " my life " ordeal , contemplating his own thinking big stage where he feels reborn . he apparently thinking very big , put his entire history comic into this performance . gone oft breakup rants , replaced controlled rants . he combines what seems ' bibliography biography ' his political , intrapersonal , stage-presence comedy . hitting every current event , especially then-recent hurricane katrina , terry schiavo fiasco , forte few comics anymore . one thing i continuously revel , this album seems so huge , gigantic all-encompassing . lewis spent his time rules enragement , white album ideosyncratic , erratic , very comfortable . his luther burbank performance very fresh , but without whole lot lasting substance . end universe easily one his best albums , his breakthrough , his most original material combined stage-finesse could captivate anyone , both sides any spectrum culture . this very close second end universe , but different kind album first place . every artist goes carnegie , whether it carlin , or lenny bruce , finds introspective route goes long time respectable performance they find within themselves . every carnegie album like , except carlin hbo special , but he still really moving point still . actuality , i don't know what think this performance . great quality obvious , but it'll require test time see if it catches internet-generation audiences	1

like . woods , previous reviewer , i not really get into van hunt music until after hearing incredibly-sultry " seconds pleasure " during sexy pedicure scene movie " something new . " ( talk perfect soundtrack scene !! ) i no idea what i missing ; well , better late than never ! want better description , van hunt style his debut album best described " d'angelo/prince edge . " but even this fails capture seamless blending musical styles , melodies riffs van hunt album . this album easily make it into my neo-soul/jazz/funk hall fame , inimitable jill scott , floetry , sweetback , remy shand , brand new heavies ( those who remember back-in-the-day ) . i didn't think anyone could measure up kem my favorite soul-jazz-rb artist , but van hunt comes very close second ! his debut album chock-full good stuff ... swipe it up asap ! highly recommended	1

released june 1990 follow-up daydream nation - album placed sonic youth top late `80s independent rock scene - goo band major label debut geffen . given deluxe edition treatment , this pivotal work now available remastered form bonus tracks second disc extras . original album - nicely freshened up john golden - strung together heavy doses sonic youth signature dissonance ; however , bizarre tunings jagged distortion crammed into tight song structures , making this one their most accessible efforts . essential tracks like " dirty boots , " " mote " " kool thing " ( featuring public enemy chuck ) may dated , but remain potent , assaulting rock clichs art-school cynicism . deluxe edition package includes widely bootlegged 8-track demos goo featuring dinosaur jr. ' mascis handful unreleased tracks . demos aren't wildly different than finished product , but they provide more immediate raw take songs . previously unreleased material , only " lee #2 " - stripped down , poetic outtake written sung guitarist lee ranaldo - particularly noteworthy . however , liner notes make good read , providing nice snapshot group tumultuous time pop music history . goo may not sonic youth best , but it undoubtedly important album their career proves experimental underground band could make major label jump without sacrificing their credibility . reason alone , it nice see goo get paid respect it deserves . james baronesynthesis.ne	1
true i see how people say he started become pop this release he started singing lil mo christina milian but everyone feeling this . two lead singles hot but so " love me hate me " sweet violins keyboards bouncy beat , " you " horns scratches great track ride . " extasy " made you wanna dance " , " watching me " hot intro , other tracks pretty hot too . however , i don't like track " if god one us " . seriously that so disrespectful god talk him like , but if i give props it it great beat . there some filler songs here like shade sheist collabo but this still better than b.g. or master record anyday . now , before i go , i must ask question all criticisers out there : i know many can't stand ja singing ( i personally don't mind it but i see where it become nuisance ) but singing love songs doesn't take away you street cred . his crew whooped 50 physically ja sold drugs . just keep thought mind singing doesn't lower your cre	1
production good news backed off . there layers , but very rarely too polised guitars dominate mix . it more intricate but intricacy seems come mosaic simply-toned sounds . guitars scratchy or acoustic , vocals thin sort lispy . unless they're screamed , then they're just thin . only thing jumps way out mix dominant bass drum - used sparingly throughout whole disc - kicks halfway through first track . lots other instruments ( real musical instruments like horns strings , opposed synth or found sounds ) fill gaps left modest mouse usual thin sound . all this jumble creates rhythm but rhythm only goes so far . it not rocky it not dancy . it just musical . it goes well under what seems main focus , melody . melodies good , fairly catchy without annoyingly poppy . all this , working well fact songs consistently good paced well over course album , make it pretty good listen overall . while i might not like it more than moon antarctica , i certainly see it easier get all way through one sitting . ---- hummit.blogspot.co	1
classic wu tang , seems like all older rap music sounds better than garbage put out today like 50 cent , game , lil jon ( most annoying voice since mystikkal ) . listen old school hip hop if you never listened rap music	1

i don't know much frontman jari m�enp�� former band ensiferum apart fact they played what they called " heroic folk metal " , but what i know debut album wintersun one most beautiful metal albums ever emerge scandinavia , well taking high spot europe top 50 metal albums ( least my opinion ) . though some may not find it appealing due melodic black/death metal common usage scandinavian metal theatre , but music here absolutely stunning ; despite only eight songs , it almost reaches hour-long point . each instrument played beauty precision comes together end make one hell masterpiece . this may also appeal large number power metal fans who handle harsh vocals , jari also employs some wonderful viking metal vocals remind one early bathory arcturus if they recorded decade later . one thing sure , jari fits comfortably ranks quorthon simen hestaes ( most recent vocalist arcturus ) viking metal best . jari m�enp�� proves any doubters he , fact , virtuoso , especially when you consider he recorded this album alone , without help any other musicians except session drummer kai hahto , who also great job giving songs precise speedy beat like any good metal drummer should . his vocals among album highlights , he sounds comfortable belting out mournful , epic tunes well screeching skill seasoned black metal vocalist . his guitars chug intensity active volcano while he may not one greatest soloists ever , he knows how bust one out without sounding unnecessary , but they aren't very common this disc they aren't all important progression album . keyboards wonderful wherever they , whether spewing out atmospheric ambient tunes or playing fun , speedy solos reminiscent children bodom janne warman . bass , like most epic melo-death recordings , falls back ranks unnoticed , but it isn't too important recording other than need bass guitar works . bottom line : if you're melo-death fan , then you must get this , no matter how hard find it ( if you see it , buy it , because god knows when you'll ever see it again ) . but even average death metal fan power metalhead find something enjoy this album , its lacing grandiose musical structures heaviness sure winner . other good melodic death metal bands include norther , kalmah , children bodom . track selections : " beyond dark sun " , " death healing " , " sadness hate " . 10/1	1

ghostface delivery one both abstract , yet contains enough charm pull average listener into his world . his lyrics contain in-jokes , references mythical places , scattershot memories his childhood ... 90% time , you no idea what he talking ; but you feel it . although this ghostface first solo album , he sounds like seasoned veteran ; handling curves rza soulful , yet mysteriously minimalistic beats samples , allowing his personality shine through each verse . there absolutely no negative thing this cd ... but one point always confused me cover graphic design direction . what exactly ghostface , raekwon , cappadonna doing cover ? overseeing production latest wu-wear shoe line ? notice cheezy laboratory test tubes up shelf dry ice smoke coming out . haha ... what ??? i mean , that cool all , but you admit , it weird concept hip hop album . but then again , it ghostface	1
i seen this group live this album accurate documentation group progression footprints live present . i think it important we know where these songs come how they where interpreted first . albums like joy ryder , phantom navigator , atlantis good examples if you find them . some these same songs heard beyond sound barrier played electric band form previously listing albums , then here them 15 years later quartet form amazing . groups interplay each other so indepedent , sometimes you wonder where wayne shorter ?, then there he smack your face or tapping you your shoulder ever slightly saying , " hey i'm over here . " this quartet wayne shorter plays every role imaginable . he horn soloist , but also accompanist brian blade , danilo perez or john patitucci , all four them catalyst well . it many other facits make wayne shorter quartet truly amazing .	1

i first discovered matthew ward `the transfiguration vincent ' ( 2003 ) , which became one my favourite albums year . i've waited eagerly follow-up which finally arrived form `transistor radio : memories utopian radio power ' matthew ward similar my opinion old blues , gospel folk singers bygone era , which makes him sound way kind familiar . his voice what i would refer fragile rasp sometimes , husky quality similar crosby , stills nash elements mississippi john hurt . musically this well produced yet minimal giving these songs open airy sound . `transistor radio ' opens instrumental cover beach boys `you still believe me ' before album gets underway . standout tracks my opinion `fuel fire ' `lullaby + exile ' . lyrically these all these songs world-weary optimistic approach . i discovered matthew ward through listening devendra banhart , iron wine , grandaddy sparklehorse . if you like any these i'm sure you'll find something enjoy here , although it closer content first two production latter . check out . ward previous record `the transfiguration vincent ' also , which contains excellent fragile cover version david bowie `lets dance ' .	1

this , ward third cd , places him forefront modern movement clearly progressive while simultaneously sounding regressive , feeling dusty age , manifesting genius pure untempered . his music defies description except say it coming somewhere seeped early blues neil young overlay feel country , blues , pop , folk . i am beginning believe , more i listen this cd , if neil young heard it he would say : " that it ... what i trying sound like ... listen those chord progressions chord changes ... that it " . people point tom waits others ward forebearers but muse here genuinely unique sounds those only budding genius could make . opening rif " fool says " feels like it came abbey road but song end you dipped young dylan . i dare you listen " get table time " not imagine yourself there ward family calls their prodigal son come down attic dinner . ward makes beautiful music --- sounds like you never encountered --- he sings melodies if he can't help himself . who could if they this much soul ? it all coming very deep place inside him you owe it yourself before you pass --- main issue he addressing this cd --- hear these songs because they most soulful melodic tunes you heard quite some time . this man lives his own songful world i can't thank him enough sharing it us transfiguration . if you put this cd your stereo it long time before you take it off . more you listen deeper it gets --- just like ward , i suspect . this genius , pure genius , you need hear it . if when you given transfiguration good listen find yourself wanting more same ( yet beautifully different ) , then go backwards ward highway end amnesia or forward transitor radio . you very glad you . enjoy	1

eagles reputation groups them greats rock country-rock . this reputation comes spite fact eagles released but seven albums their two incarnations , six which they released 1972 1979 . their last album " hell freezes over , " orphan released 1994 . first eagles greatest hits album covered only pre-joe walsh years . second eagles greatest hits album focused last two eagles ' albums , one song first four one song live album . those us liked eagles both incarnations , two greatest hits albums better than nothing . this album combines all 20 tracks both greatest hits albums , adds 11 songs , solving greatest hits problem very cost effectively . there other eagles collections . " very best eagles " most songs first two greatest hits collections , but considering price this cd versus cd , why not get extra three songs ? there also boxed set provides 52 eagles songs , but substantially greater price . i think if you seeking representative greatest hits collection reasonable price , this collection one . it easy look back this music put it down because 30 years later it no longer fresh , new , or original . there hundreds imitators eagles . however , eagles one first , many ways , first . those who came later imitated eagles performed similar music so many times after while impact eagles appears diluted . truth , impact occurred when these songs released , part continuing evolution music . try put yourself back early 70s when this music released . it great then ; fresh , innovative , young . jungle beat disco , techno-pop , discordant chords nine inch nails all yet , beatles only broken up recently . i always remember this music how unique it when released .	1

i don't know tim mcgraw person therefore cannot comment this man character . however , i comment tim mcgraw supposed singer/musician . he terrible voice cannot sing , evidenced anyone who ever seen one rare clips him singing live . nor he write any his own songs ( even he freely admits this ) . nor he play any musical instruments , unlike country singers such brad paisley , who real talent strumming guitar . top , tim mcgraw songs aren't even country music songs ( least not according tried-and-true definition this once great musical genre ) . i can't really think any quality his should allowed him become ' big ' musical figure he currently . so it external factors - marketing , hype , course , old maxim " there sucker born every minute . " those suckers , course , those people who lap up tim mcgraw ' music ' actually pay money buy his albums , including this one . tim mcgraw not country artist . if you want listen real country music ( better singing voices boot ) , then go look artist - they exist out there , even if they don't same hype applies tim mcgraw	-1
this my first donell jones ' cd , i truly say this far perhaps best cd i've heard several years any artist . tracks start finish great , i found myself listening cd all day first time i played it . what prompted me buy cd song i'm gonna which i hear more my satellite radio stations than i locally here michigan . because quality music , i very rarely buy cd anymore , however , after hearing i'm gonna , i telling friend how much i liked song my friend happened cd only after listening maybe 3 or 4 other tracks , i knew i wouldn't disappointed . i love this cd - great job , donell !!! what i am disappointed lack promotion this cd . it just burns me up when there some non-mainstream artists great product whatever ( dumb ) reason , marketing depts . record companies don't actively promote artists such donell jones who quality products . there isn't even video out , which this day age , artist must video further promote their product(s ) . so shame jive records ( all other record companies ) who don't actively aggressively promote cd quality this one exhibits . i recommend this cd anyone who appreciate good quality rb - both youngheads oldheads ( i'm old head my mid-40 ) . i doing my own promotion this cd contact my local radio stations ask they include i'm gonna their rotation .	1

india . arie great job when she came out 2001 delivered acoustic soul ; fact , she such great job album nominated whopping seven grammys . seven grammy nominations means you'll least win one , right ? well , we all know , that not way it went down ( she even performed saturday night live backwards 7 her shirt ) . but thing , after she her mother complained how backwards grammys , india quickly went into studio record voyage india , which she scored three grammys after all . i'm not saying bad album , but me it didn't stand out next acoustic soul . after she kind disappeared , but she finally emerged testimony : vol . 1 , life relationship , her best album date . i listened this entire album few times i couldn't find one song not worth rewinding . there standout after standout , like " these eyes " , " good morning " " india song " . india also good job covering don henley " heart matter " ; even necessary we-are-the-world song " better people " sounds great . course there few songs empowerment here , most notably " i am not my hair " featuring akon ( one those artists seems shine every album except his own ) . country superstars rascal flatts also impress acoustic " summer " ( but they're only singing background vocals , so i don't know if should really count guest spot ) . any rate , every song here damn good , so whether you want some great music play your friends or you want follow track 5 your own private party , my testimony pick up india latest album never take it out your stereo . anthony ruper	1

yes , faith hill back country . when " cry " first released 2002 , i can't say i big fan album . however , slowly but surely , i became attached after few plays now it not so bad . but now , faith back music made her . country tracks this cd show faith never left her home country music . although tracks like " sunshine summertime , " " mississippi girl , " " like we never loved all " meant highlights album , those tracks just don't cut it . but it took tracks more deeper meaning slower pace make me fall love album . tracks like number eight , " i want you " really moved me . soft guitar faith pure voice this track could melt anyone warm goo ... you know what i mean . i really sent over edge , officially fell love album after i heard last track , " paris .

this disk my introduction leonard cohen . his voice took little bit getting used , but i soon came appreciate his deep , baritone growl . cohen belongs school singer/songwriters such dylan who not traditionally fine singing voices but who bring dimension emotion their own lyrics more than make up any technical faults . cohen fascinating point view ; i particularly enjoy title track , which he laments loss moral reference points point he becomes nostalgic unambiguous evil represented stalin berlin wall . one drawback this recording his long cover " always ; " it giant dead spot this disk	1

there always little politics involved when someone decides it time drop greatest hits album . someone like tupac shakur , it just posthumous thing : album eulogy after lifelong legacy hits . someone like say michael jackson , greatest hits album key tool during trial time when your presence under public eye intensifies courtroom cameras become free advertisement . but most people , greatest hits album simply signals end your shine this here biz-ness music . ja rule-and his greatest hits exodus ( inc/def jam ) it little trickier . late nineties , ja rule ar devil made agreement where he signed over his street cred soul pop success . beginning , it worked out ja rule his polygamous duets like " put it me " " ain't it funny " kept his beach chair south beach . yet gradually , his fans losing their testosterone fellas block black doo-rags weren't nodding their heads much . we gave him one last chance he used it bobby brown sing duet building roof " thug lovin '" . even rule himself knew he made boo-boo . so , this sudden resurgence includes rotten apples most current hip-hop anthem " new york " , " clap back " , . kelly midas touch " wonderful " throws us off somewhat . ja rule career really downward spiral ? sh*t , exodus hot . chronological order most part , exodus allows listeners see where it went right ja rule , where it went wrong , then back where it went right again . hardcore rapper who blushed comparisons tupac , sensitive fellow singing thug serenades , buddy fat joe , man who gave him back his figurative bandana sagging jeans . exodus solid well put together greatest hits album . even new track " me " seals ja rule place bona fide rapper . still , we left funny feeling end album . that when ar devil pops out his pitchfork asks ja rule if he remembers agreement .	1
this record really makes you feel alive that pretty high praise . this record also new sound bob dylan ( what else new ) gospel backup singers . steve douglas ' sax rocks . billy cross kicks lead guitar david mansfield rips strings . through all dylan voice rings out crisp true . no rough edges here . this almost soul music . no , it soul music . maybe not james brown , but soul nonetheless . i've listening " street legal " something like twenty years it keeps getting better , sounding new , because i'm hearing something different each every time i play it	1
tilly wall pioneered weird new kind indie-pop -- tap-dance pop ! worked well their debut , it works even better " bottoms barrels , " which makes everything their sound fuller . instrumentation bigger , melodies catchier , tapping more promiment , their second album just more fun general . it opens echoing vocals over barely-audible electric guitar ... then it joined piano , increasingly drama heels start ratatatting background . " i kidnapped real young sweet taste love/built fondness things just weren't good enough/i cradled crow , always shooed off dove/which tagged me na�ve son , " kianna alarid sings little breathlessly . it followed up lo-fi mellotron swirls " urgency " latin-flavoured stomp-stomps " bad education " ( " girls boys full frustration/ st. valentine , i think i taste it ! " ) . then they tap frolic through shimmering keyboard pop , pretty little piano ballads , solid indiepop , tambourine-laden dance music . this omaha pop band really something special -- they really add life vibrancy retro indie-pop , they knack spinning up melodies make you want dance whether you like it or not . perhaps only weak spot their folkier songs less engaging than their sprightly ones , though these still above averagethe album seems center unhappy , rebellious youth -- they're young , feisty , they want out into world . boys who want girls , frightened young girls , teens who " slept bad side town . " while lyrics playful fun , they also very dark ( " so when your bones broke you're all alone/and fog so thick you can't see up close/just know i end up strangled too " )the music colourful swirl bells , tambourine , xylophone , recorder swirls warm-tinged keyboard , some guitar bass lurking down there somewhere . no drums -- jamie williams just tap-dances really hard rhythm music , surprisingly it works well , if not better . tilly wall still colourful infectious ever , anyone who adored their first album practically worship " bottoms barrels .	1
prince 1981 album controversy classic album his catalog . title track standout immediately . this longer version than single version features prayer . song funky effective . " sexuality " great disco/funk number . " me , baby " probably one sexiest songs he ever . this full length version one hear . " private joy " funky song which favorite album . " ronnie , talk russia " short protest kind song . same goes " annie christian " , which he wrote shooting john lennon , ronald reagan , various atlanta child murders . not effective " ronnie , talk russia " but decent track nonetheless . overall highlight prince career	1
anyone who thinks madonna nothing more than vapid image-maker , listen clsely tracks this album . you come realize madonna created many , many memorable songs during her now-more-than-20 year career . this album only sampler her hits , because more than one disc would needed all her hits her first 1983-1991 period . one hear feel her growth person artist this disc , poppy dance music first deeper more introspective material later . course , her fans remember each track companion video firmly their memory . such power video . people who never really paid attention videos surprised how well-done songs . this collection shows what true cultural chameleon madonna , how she matured artist . this collection true must-have music fans , not just madonna fans , because madonna true legend music industry , she shows no signs slowing down	1
i write this after reading previous review . " tonight night " no point view , you say ? you no powers perception/discerment , my ( harsh , yes ) response . way album produced , played , written ( it bit like great play or movie script , isn't it ? ) point view , songs tell tale . depression , despair , sadness , loneliness , anger , regret , it all here . not say it downer album , it it isn't . point : when i angry young teenager , i'd put who " live leeds " it would help release anger , non-destructive ( except my hearing , perhaps . eh , wot ? ) way . it same way " tonight night " . when i'm feelin ' bit under weather , emotionally , i put this it mirror my feelings , i sense there someone else out there who felt same way . every song keeper ( though it took few listens get used ) , every song contributes " theme " album whole , which " it what it " , either you relate it , or you can't . i think there awful lot people who relate it , or least appreciate it distance , since it rightly considered masterpiece , not only neil , but rock music general . if you survived early ' 70s aware " youth culture " time , you certainly know what neil singing . either you friend , or heard someone , or saw it tv , or read it news , but utopian dream faded " vietnam veterans returning home , nixon watergate , etc . " reality , " old reality " ( one our parents used live , you know , before late ' 60s , all ... ) re-asserting itself vengeance , we midst type reality again today . this cd more relevant than ever , if you think buffalo springfield csny best neil offer , you would wrong , neil just gettin ' started ! now , when " time fades away " re-issued ( please !!! neil , i'm begging you !!! release it expanded 2 cd set , pleeeaaaase ! aaarrgh ! yer killin ' me ! i can't wait forever !!! save my life , because ... " time fades away " !!! " bridge , we'll build it now . it may take lot time , it may lonely , but , ooh babe ... bridge fallin ' ... " ) don't let bridge fall , neil ! anyway , ( i want start web petition cd ... ) , " tonight night " best studio neil , " time fades away " best live neil , " rust never sleeps , " live rust " notwithstanding . huge praise this album . neil young premiere artist this his brightest ( dark ) masterpiece	1

i bought this last year i listen it once while . i both 2 volumes b/c i couldn't afford whole box set sadly ( plus , it wouldn't fit my cd rack anyways ) . but back point . two new tracks complete garbage , though nice instrument skills displayed them . i'll review track track : 1.it weird , but creative-7/102 . nice beat lyrics-9/103 . great song general-10/104 . dirty-6/105 . great love ballad . later covered some singer named melissa morgan , i think-10/106 . very fast-paced cool-8/107 . one greatest songs ever recorded . pure classic-10/108 . good song , but gets boring after while . still love it though-9/109 . never liked this one . pop life best tune off album-4/1010 . very very creative soulful , later covered tlc-10/ 1011.3 rd no . 1 hit . need i say more ? 10/1012 . great beat , but lyrics pure garbage . sounds like it written his then wife , mayte-5/1013 . duet w/ sheena easton . very funky nice-10/1014 . ha ha ha . it ok . it james brown feel it-7/1015 . funky tune . not suggested played around young ones-8/ 1016.5 th last no . 1 song billboard 100 . it bluesy feel it-9/1017 . crap-0/1018 . lovely ballad . this song should played every prom . i might suggest this my prom this coming year . 10/10 ... don't make same mistake me . if you starting get into his music , whole box set avoid later ones like best ultimate	1
dresden dolls just one those bands . you either get them or you don't , which isn't intended judgment those who don't . opening track slowly developing song follows sort anthemic rise . this pretty disconcerting first since dolls play only piano drums . it feels totally out left field . then comes rollicking punk girl anachronism . after overtly musical-theatrical missed me , oddity disappears . music still unusual , but it suddenly feels perfectly normal hear it . they exactly what they label themselves : brechtian punk cabaret , seems like nothing out ordinary . rest album settles into perfect rhythm beauty punctuated whimsy c-o-b occasional moments hurt anger . if you make it through last four tracks without loving it , you much harder soul than i am . let clear : this isn't original music all ; truly original can't labeled words we already use music . so " brechtian punk cabaret " can't original . but it sounds so different anything you've ever heard , there moments you'll find yourself feeling if you hearing music first time	1
i like fact this album you fall asleep , but there times when mind ticking over faster . different version track ' monday - paracetamol ' ulrich found soundtrack gran turismo 4 , called ' million miles away ' . you know how sometimes twins don't identical ? well , faster , more aggressive beat , atmospherics layered below this mix create ' foreground music ' - driving electrosnare ought get people moving opposed just tapping . intro more get you sooner . people critical drawn-out repetition this album ought find more complex construction this version more their liking . clocks 7:10 , but takes you through few places way . i managed record it my ps2 onto md , you might able ' find ' it somewhere ones zeroes . there few things worse than parents dress their twins identical clothing , wouldn't you agree ? i hope this helpful someone out there , i would rate this version higher ( subjectively ) than stuff this album	1
michael buble greatest male artist since frank sinatra . i absolutely love this cd dvd . he super personable very entertaining !	1
cast album 1963 broadway premiere production oliver ! actually recorded during show pre-broadway run los angeles . oliver ! played subsequent audiences san francisco , detroit toronto before opening imperial theatre new york january 6 , 1963 . show played 774 performances before prematurely ending season play 9-month national tour , later returning new york `farewell ' run 64 performances . she rapturous acclaim london three years previously , georgia brown played role nancy , earned similar praise her performance new york . her rich , velve t-t inged voice especially haunting chill inducing ballad " long he needs me " . composer lionel bart wrote " it fine life " especially brown after learning she cast role london production . ron moody also scored heavily london his tour-de-force turn fagin , but producers fearing his portrayal `too ethnic ' , role taken clive revill broadway premiere . revill just come his celebrated role irma la douce , his interpretation fagin every bit valid ron moody . bruce prochnik winsome wistful oliver , michael goodman delight artful dodger . wisely-retained original london company handful first-rate supporting players : hope jackman shrill mrs corney ; up-and-coming barry humphries mr sowerberry ( humphries would later graduate playing fagin before his beloved alter-ego dame edna unleashed herself world ) . promising young belter alice playten smartly-showcased nancy offsider bet . but , sound mix broadway album always rather flat dull , despite recorded stereo format day . voices orchestra no vibrancy or depth , this due studio which they recorded it , where ceiling very low sound not necessary acoustic projection . nevertheless , recording charm energy which overrides technical shortcomings . this new cd reissue rca offers some interesting bonus materials including musical director don pippin sharing his memories show ; barry humphries performing " that your funeral " ( london cast album but left off broadway album ); live recording patti lupone singing " long he needs me " ( lupone played nancy short-lived broadway revival 1986 ) . good value	1
this album perfectly acceptable distillation tribe 5 lps , two songs not included any those lps : if papes come , nice side ; vivrant thing , which i assume everybody already enough . this less reason exist than hits , rarities remixes or second half love movement , it would make lot more sense if they put all extra tracks one volume instead giving little time . i suppose this recording gives little too much preference earlier albums , but lot tribe fans partial first one or two them , so i guess justified . i see no point buying this if you much fan all ; it makes lot sense least two their albums instead because all them lot worthy content cannot compressed volume like this . but if you just want grab couple mid-90s hits one rap greatest groups , then go ahead ..	1
this band suffered terrible injustice they no way deserved . end personal difficulties then .. trajedy just not what moving , energetic , innovative fun band deserved all . i wish i seen them live . they always my " check out more " list i picked this up record store owner suggestion . very fine introduction .. i knew them tiny bit .. least enough know they cool .. but this compilation great crash course overview ... but it very sad because i just can't belive something lively really alive this music sounds could gone . however , tunes really hip sounding could come out two years now . they haven't dated all .. 1996 .. isn't long ago .. remember scientists say we entered new epoch past several decades called anthropocine ..... we'll see if lasts any longer . anyways ... this cd breaks my heart ... but it rocks soooooo gooood !! super hot singer looks like my first serious girlfriend ... reason this cd breaks my heart . i going out her when i first saw lush strum dreamily late night alternative mtv ... heartbreak .... this cd makes me want pick up some their other albums .. but then i'm worried getting addicted " dead " band .. because i'll always pine them .... heartbreak ... i'm pining already . red-haired singer-guitarist rocked rocked rocked . this very fine very special cd excellent band should not forgotten anyway i hope all lush family doing well today .. because i'm heartbrokenly love ....	1

child legendary singer choosing same profession difficult . lalah hathaway , daughter legendary singer donny hathaway , who listed musical influence famous artists every music genre , it would seem both enormous blessing burden exist shadow such icon . but somehow , hathaway handles weight her lineage grace integrity . course , it doesn't hurt she undeniably talented her own right . last year , hathaway released her third record , " outrun sky , " which marked welcome return this exceptional singer , who fans waiting 10 years new release . if her large , active website community 500 enthusiasts any indication , her audience hasn't diminished least albums . instead , they've eagerly scooped up any recording featuring single note hathaway . years since her last record , she featured number notable recordings other artists , including grover washington , wayman tisdale , marcus miller , meshell ndegeocello , joe sample . outrun sky displays hathaway jazzy , hearty voice perfectly , she torch singer ballad well she uptempo rb groove . evidence this found album first two singles , luther vandross tribute , " forever , always , love , which arguably better than original , crazy love , upbeat track " better better .

this first red hot chilli peppers albums i bought , many years ago now . i relistened it last night because i've wanting put up review this great album while now . i tend nominate albums " great " if they few really good tracks [ like midnight oil classic " 10-1 " or lot good songs , like midnight oil " diesel dust " or metallica reload ] . californication gets nod great album second category . there two tracks i count very good this album : around world , title track . first fast furious guitar assault then slows down some guitar picking . it some near rap style vocals very nice scat vocal section . highly energetic song . title track more laid back , some poetic lyrics concerning influence hollywood hollywood lifestyle . when i first got this album , these two songs i repeatedly listened , what probably tipped me into buying album , heard them radio , hearing some other nice songs album . whole , album described funky , ryhme laiden , alliterative lyrics , bass prominent music . i suppose best album tracks 1-7 . i heard track 3 , scar tissue , it nice song , though not kind song compel you buy this album . still , it very pretty , there few similarly laid back mellow songs album like this-otherside , californication road trippin ' . get top didn't really strike me good song first listen , though i really like cool guitar sound it . last night , i still liked guitar sound , but maybe song better than i gave it credit . perhaps porcelain initially my least favourite song album . it not very good pop song-not really catchy all , but , i think if you treat it like lullaby , it maybe not so bad after all . some songs nice , overlapping vocals weaving out , like otherside saviour . latter strikes me beach boys flavour-it little bit experimental sounding . speaking influences , purple stain , whilst not particulary good song , guitar riff out led zeppelin whole lotta love included . right time features beatle-esque backward lyric vocal outro . probably my favourite " easter-egg " song this album emit remmus . it not lyrically complex song , but its simplicity catchy chorus winner : " what could wetter than , english girl , american man . london summertime ... " . really cool song , i'm surprised this one few songs this album which not get radio airplay ... it definitely deserved . perhaps this song touch clash it . other tracks feature nice choruses you sing , like parallel universe , scar tissue , easily , road trippin ' . whilst there many good songs this album , album depth enough interesting , even when there songs sub-good . i didn't make any notes last night i like dirt this velvet glove , indicating they're not particularly interesting me , though i suppose you could say some may find i like dirt catchy . so , all all , highly listenable album , which rare , i think . many good songs , many interesting if not good songs . couple really terrific songs . my only complaint ? album suffers ' snap , crackle pop ' , which you hear if you listen good quality headphones , like i . reason , i'd give sound quality this album 2 out 5 . great album	1
bit untrue . this album times seem like run sign o . but it not fair comparrison : this album much lusher than sign o , just brilliant . songs man , songs . this album also fufills promise made around world , ten fold . highlights " life so nice " " mountains " one prince lushest songs . anotherloverholeinyohead which great prince funk song , kiss which amazing prince funk song , all ballads . they equally brilliant funk songs , something prince sometimes couldn't pull off	1
vivaldi spirit must symphony when they recorded this . though i parts vivaldi 4 seasons few baroque compilation cd , this far best overall performance/recording . example . tight driven strings break into lazy beginning summer section awe inspiring . i never really paid much attention part until i heard this cd . my hat' off also recording artists this cd not overly awash waltzy-smaltzy concert hall reverb . it dynamic tight ! yeah ! oh , just so you know , i'm not only lover great baroque music , but enjoy rock , pop , blues , metal well . hint : if you'd like hear great marriage hard rock classical , check out rondo veneziano albums " magica melodia , " " visioni di venezia , " " i grandi successi originali .

after fooling around their sound their first album , audioslave break through sound their own . while first one sounded too much like rage against machine , this one mellows sound bit comes up something , if anything , more " grungy " . though not completely , i wouldn't call it soundgarden . it kind simple really easy get into , yet it not boring . i listen it over over again not get tired it . this album there softer songs like " heaven dead " , " curse " , " yesterday tomorrow " ; but there also harder ones like " your time come " ( which sounds lot like lesser known metallica song called " bad seed " ) , " drown me slowly " , " man or animal " . " doesn't remind me " melody sounds almost hippie-ish " #1 zero " probably best song i've heard them play . chris sounds amazing this song , he always . tom spends less time making weird sounds more time just doing some great guitar playing . last album , there wasn't really any time you could say " man awesome solo ! " here , although alot music more mellow , there some really hard heavy-metal style solos riffs better too . also brad drumming much more lively here , more fills three drum solos ( okay , i'm not calling him neil peart , but it hell alot better than basic 1-2-3-4 click track drumming plagued most first album ) . audioslave went release more funk-influenced album after this but this stands my favorite three i would recommend this anyone who enjoys straight-out rock roll doesn't mind it little simple . audioslave this album : chris cornell - vocalstim commerford - bassbrad wilk - drumstom morello - guitar	1
i must say when i first heard " kick push " i thought myself this guy really something talk because he such metaphoric rhymer his delivery very strong so i know i buy lupe fiasco debut album " food liquor " . after listening this album beginning end i not all disappointed but indeed this album really let me know there still few rappers out there still kicking rhymes issues we deal everyday life instead hearing these other mc dont rap anything except cars , clothes , jewelry , women . i would recommend this album anyone fan real rap because this album open your eyes alot things life . my 5 favorite tracks : 1 . " cool " - this song basically young man who died(not literally ) but he able come back life try make change better but same time he chose live his life same way he lived it once before . song very metaphor deep . 2 . " he say she say " - this song little boy who doesnt visible father it affecting him deeply . 3 . " hurt me soul " - this song talks just any issue you think women degraded rap music , drug dealing , crooked cops , government not offering black people welfare overcharging healthcare , johns prostitutes . song also very nice hook . 4 . " sunshine " - this song this girl he falls love club eventhough he not looking love he cannot resist it this girl . 5 . " pressure " featuring jay-z- very nice concept it lupe standpoint eventhough im not big jay-z fan he still put down nice verse . other songs i like " just might ok " , " daydreaminin " , " kick push " , " i gotcha " , " instrumental " , " american terrorists " . i would recommend this album anyone who true fan real rap because it not disappoint you all !!!!	1
this album just good all other tool cd . tool real artists , unlike 99% all other " rock " bands these days , tool real talent doesn't care mtv or all other mainstream crap . if you like real music get this cd . however , if you like 12 years old only watch mtv then get fall out boy or some crappy pop/rock band like	1
if you fan church you enjoy fine re-working some classic church songs . new arrangements emphasize acoustic but still retain " spacey " feel marks music produced kilbey , willson-piper , koppes , powles . stripped down versions bring brand new sort freshness , emphasizes absolute beauty found some tunes . plus , 5 new creative songs justify 4.5 - 5.0 star rating . new listeners choice titles melodic approach makes accesibility novice ears . highly recommended	1
movie : ***** dvd quality : ***** dvd extras : *** dramas _teenage gays coming out closet ! _ so plentiful , they sometimes run together my mind . " edge seventeen " exception statement because it genuinely exceptional movie every way . screenplay todd stephens sensitive true life , or rather , many people lives . it tells story eric ( chris stafford ) , young man growing up small town sandusky , ohio , who just beginning grapple his sexual orientation . what so refreshing script eric portrayed neither victim nor hero ; he simply kid cusp adulthood who trying find himself . eric sometimes selfish thoughtless ; other times sweet naive ; occasionally manipulative ; but generally good guy ... other words : completely human . holds true other characters movie , including eric parents who love him dearly but aren't quite sure what make his fast-changing moods appearance ; his female best friend ( tina holmes ) who harbors deeper feelings him ; his new gay " family " ( headed lea delaria ) who fiercely supportive , yet sometimes insensitive where he terms his coming out process . thankfully , stephens ' screenplay remains true itself right down final fadeout doesn't cop out trying wrap everything up into neat little package ; end movie , there definite sense these characters continue live , learn , make mistakes , thrive . ( sequel , anyone ? )the entire cast uniformly outstanding . chris stafford embodies eric all his complexity ; his performance never strikes false note . tina holmes amazing his confused female friend ; more than once her face vocal inflections reminded me extremely young meryl streep ( high compliment indeed ) . stephanie mcvay distinguishes herself eric baffled mother , andersen gabrych fine eric first same sex crush whose confident veneer covers troubled heart . perhaps best all comic lea delaria , who turns warm winning dramatic performance earth mother whose wisdom understanding always available eric , regardless how hard he sometimes pushes her away . strand dvd offers flawless letterboxed transfer featuring outstanding audio video . somewhat sparse extras limited theatrical trailers " edge seventeen " five other feature films designed appeal lgbt audiences . it would wonderful additional benefit cast crew biographies filmographies reasearch tool viewers who want explore others works filmmakers , but this small complaint . overall , this truly must-see film , one worthy repeat viewings .	1
this cd marks cornerstone reich . delightful sextet he things bowing marimbas or playing them normally . first its parts , 5 , unfolds brilliantly his classic minimal manner . 3rd most fun . 5th , its intricacies wild wild pulses end , always leaves me breathless . then , six marimbas one his greatest even tapestries . i recommend this cd most highly anyone interested reich	1
heard this one radio -- oddly , track " ballad yvonne johnson " , knew immediately i it . it all this aspects just what draws me record -- it rootsy , it political , it told story true ( i totally " felt " yvonne johnson end ) , told fearlessly unflinchingly , it this amazing , distinctive , absolutely perfect woman voice . cd full great songs , standouts me " hiway 9 " " dark side town " " wonderland " , but i love everything here . my tastes eclectic -- just check out what i reviewed this point -- i enjoy good singer songwriter stuff . but my standard dylan , townes , guy clark , stuff some meat it , stuff well - chosen words , frankly , bit attitude . this record meets standard . it also wonderful voice .	1
this cool album . my favorite nelly songs it , nelly lot funny stuff it , too . i should add he also sways singing rapping . whatever , here very best songs(in my opinion)hot herre-a funny song , perfect raunchy moments . also my favorite nelly song all time . best time listen this song summer . work it-i don't know where begin . so i'll just say this much-it very cool interesting lyrics , one best tunes this side hip-hop music . # 1/number one-nelly shows many challenges life how he got one top artists this very stellar well put together song . there many other songs i like , but i'm only showing top 3 here . but , anyway , this very good cd if you like nelly , you should buy it . oh , nelly my second favorite rapper all time next who else but eminem	1
great , i get 4th reviewer . i guess sums up how popular this band . well , rare gems hard find . this disk lot variety but dmst definitely distinct sound . i there previous 2 disks think this one best . more warm cozy , country feel it . some it very beautiful , some slightly annoying noisy . if you investigating them because godspeed constellation stuff , they not same . well , you get some tremelo guitar ( what anyway ) , but music far more pleasant palatible . enjo	1
i dont want or need add anything these performances , - other reviewers spot , - they simply wonderful , life affirming , even . what i would like comment sound . this forty year old set , always sounded good . recently , however , i upgraded my beloved castle howard s3s nakamichi amp quad esl63s twin valve amps new valve pre-amp . so , you imagine , i've rummaging through my collection , hearing everything afresh . amazing discoveries ? several , but this among happiest . this forty year old sound fresh daisy , - it superbly re-mastered superb masters sounds , well , superb . so dont just think you're getting one gramophone most precious performances , you're also getting sound better than you could possibly expected	1

nothing stands out this record except genuine feeling melancholly . if you're looking complex sounds or melodies , maybe you'll find some here , but i think you're probably better off something like killers if you claim that what you want . this isn't pop music , this rock roll its purest . pop music stuff they play radio ' cause everyone recognize it its own song instantly ... rock whatever it it couldn't care less what you think it . i like this album ' cause it stands true its morbidly romantic title ; i actually no longer own this cd ' cause i too felt it too generic although it started grow me when i wasn't really wanting it ( i don't know why , this almost year ago if not ); i since managed experience several feel- " good " listens rhapsody.com, i'm really seriously thinking buying this again . i haven't found better example this " kind " music , except maybe couple songs here there , but not entire albums devoted this feeling self-loathing romance combined . fall out boy killers both topping headlines these days , but why ? fall out boy music more generic than this sense doesn't any place society heart , supposing society one . yeah , some their songs you kinda love get stuck your head ' cause it gets you devoted band but one spin opener " our lawyers made us ... " enough ruin someone entire day . killers some good music , but little if any it found radio . i like " change your mind " " believe me natalie " songs like , but stuff got me familiar band musically just catchy jingles . let me put it this way ; if you want your heart feel music , buy this supposing loud music doesn't bother you . if you want something occupy your mind , buy fall out boy or any other top selling music act . personally , i attest firmly idea mind polutant ; it deceives itself , more often than not tends wither up waste away due lack excercise ( or more like lack training ; no one willingly exercises their mind w/o prior encouragement ) , it importance sooooo over-rated . heart life may fake or it may more real than anything , but i think reality itself or any aspect thereof could just easily said same . what person w/o his/her ability feel reality ? i feel reality , i feel this music . i still admit this isn't best i could 1/10 way imagine ; not heavenly calls angels sing my hopes , but post-punk band , it shiznit !!	1
i first purchased this album tape 1992 . unfortunately , some criminal broke my car stole my tapes . well unless they keen ear music , they probably couldn't sell these average purchaser hot items . this album beyond great . i loved it over eight years . out 100 tapes stolen , this one hardest replace . good lover ...... great , sweetest thing ... excellent . whole thing must	1
redwalls imitative , yes . there certainly times , while listening album , you'll hear other , better acts . some point , you may think you're listening lennon luscious vocals " tomorrow never knows , " but it just redwalls . just redwalls , but still good still lot fun . these guys lot spunk great live . really great . cd host few uniquely redwall moments . first track killer , abrupt musical transition near end song truly beautiful . these guys no dylan or beatles , but no one ever going , they'd probably first tell you so ; i heard them unabashedly cover their musical heroes cover them well . all this said , cd listenable ; there no bad tracks . de nova won't go down history timeless cd mine or anybody else collection , but doesn't mean it isn't worthy some listens then maybe few more . i buy next release , gladly ; i see them live again , gladly . i give this album four stars . redwalls accomplish what they set out . they prove their thesis , so speak , but don't they set world fire process . , record , i'd rather listen them over pretentious phonies like cold play " any day , any day , any day ... " ( that me imitating smiths because i am not original either . ) happy listening . let them you what they ask no more . you won't disappointed	1

it punk ? it goth ? alternative ? metal ? play this cd 10 different people i bet few them agree how categorize it . that one things makes it great . if you afi fan their early days three-chord songs answer stay fashionable , then this likely wouldn't appeal you . this not punk sense their earlier cds ( yes , i heard them ) . but punk influence still there , particularly vocals " but home nowhere " " bleed black . " someone who only listens pop radio , they would think this punk . someone who thinks crass real punk , they obviously wouldn't . if you look through one-star reviews , lot them people who mad afi " sold out " sign major label no longer sounds like they when they writing breakfast cereal . nor this goth , per se , but if you only read lyric sheet looked photo band this era , you might assume they goth . okay , review : this cd amazing . i grew up listening old punk goth , yet my days wanting listen those exclusively mostly over . life gotten too complicated me invest time energy into concerned categorization or " selling out . " afi appeals part me liked those styles music , because i still hear those influences . my favorite songs this cd vary almost day , i love each them best different times . atmospheric call arms " miseria cantare " incredibly energizing almost bouncy " this celluloid dream , " there enough variety here keep it interesting . it not like listening same song over over . " ... but home nowhere " positively epic . lyrics worthwhile read commit memory , dark almost poetic times . if , like me , you grew up listening cure , bauhaus , joy division , etc . you might just love this cd . davey havok guys afi combining varied influences interesting , complex way . passion this music undeniable . after i got this cd , it almost three weeks before i even wanted listen anything else , just because i kept discovering something new subsequent listens . all afi cds something offer , i really like all them different reasons . but this one true masterpiece great introduction anyone considering checking out afi .	1

often called world greatest guitar player , eric clapton certainly upper echelon rock elite . his career spanned five decades , both member three successful bands later brilliant solo career . " cream clapton " contains 19 tracks all stages eric career , his days cream ( " sunshine o your love " , " white room " , " crossroads " , " badge " ) , blind faith ( " presence lord " ) , derek dominoes ( " bell bottom blues " course " layla " ) his solo career ( " i shot sheriff " , his great cover " knockin ' heaven door " , " cocaine " , " wonderful tonight " , " promises , " i can't stand it " ) . all songs sound great , even though they could still use tad bit more tweaking . my only major qualm this collection there few good songs missing . " lay down sally " , example , got all way up number three billboard hot 100 , yet it not make it onto this collection . also , while it most likely not included personal reasons ( though it made it onto later , inferior collection " clapton chronicles " ) , " tears heaven " also huge hit . " forever man " one clapton few quality recordings 1980s ' , it also warrants place this collection . last but not least , clapton two pretty big hits after this collection released : " change world " ( which made it number five hot 100 stayed there nearly year ) " my father eyes " . granted , i know they came afterwards , but i'd like see them appear collection someday . hopefully , clapton get two cd collection all his best work someday , but until now , " crwam clapton " offers exactly , what it promises , even if it only sampler	1

i think what many people not understand this cd , well sacred revolution , they live recordings conferences such oneday passion . songs these cds mere snippets over-all experience each conference . me , they serve reminders conferences bring back memories what i learned experienced there ( which , passion conference always profound challenging ) . unlike concert , where focus music audience enjoyment , songs passion conference specifically coincide what happening , either message just given , or perhaps focus moment ( missions , prayer , adoration , specific verse etc ) . cds contain " most memorable " songs moments those who participated , which probably doesn't necessarily resonate those who weren't there . artists cd all their own albums , which probably more representative their musical abilities produced wider audience . if you haven't attended passion conference , you may not " get " this cd . so instead complaining this album , i'd recommend all artists ' individual projects : david crowder band , chris tomlin , charlie hall , shane shane , christy nockels	1

big rich took music industry storm when this , their first album , hit #1 billboard charts 2004 . some people criticize their fusion country rock , but i must say i think they fantastic . first all , i must say combination big kenny alphin john rich voices produces music real feeling power like i never felt before . also , while they most know their bouncy songs like save horse ( ride cowboy ) , they broad range song style , such songs drinkin ' `bout you , touching holy water , inspirational saved . overall , i really like big rich , think they great career front them . i yet heard big rich song i didn't like , this album really great one listen my long car rides . so , if you want hear great album , lots genre-busting songs , then get this album . it superb	1
ok , i just could not resist coming here review this . i've this cd 4 years now i still listen quite bit , proof right there this cd definetly classic ( my book least ) every single song here original , guitar riffs simply amazing , lyrics i not even describe words how much they hit home how breathtaking they . if your goo goo doll fan , you still not this cd , i deeply encourge you go buy it now ! this goos like you've never heard them before . cd pure genius , my opinion best cd i've ever heard	1
gene vincent probably one most forgotten acts ' 50 , because other than " be-bop-a-lula " , you ususally won't hear any his songs any oldies stations . that shame , because there some real gems here . lot songs goofy ' 50s feeling them , " hey cat " , etc ., but if you overlook , you're real treat . gene his blue caps all great musicians , but guitarist cliff gallup really steals show most songs . johnny meeks plays lead last three tracks . hear cliff his best take listen " race devil " . i'm sure his guitar work astounded people ' 50 , it even more refreshing listen , now . playing gretsch duo jet single-coil pickups , he tears through his solos smoothness seasoned jazz player , yet rockabilly attitude . if you like rockabilly or just like old ' 50 rock , give this disk spin . if you overlook lyrics , you'll see how timeless this music really .	1
" goo " never sounded any better . sonic youth first major label album mixed reviews , hardcore fans , " industry " , mainstream , yes , even band itself . however , this deluxe edition sounds incredibly good just new powerful sounding any other current modern release . this re-master finally gets band stamp approval well . while " goo " helmed transition album , some songs this album " classic " sonic youth songs , rock just good scream drone . new re-master album much more clearer than original release , allowing you hear songs breath flow , especially demo version disc album . these group songs sound ten times better than old original ' bootleg ' release , show you what true " re-master " album should sound like . new bonus songs pretty good well , particularly ' tuff boyz ' ' issac ' . one thing i wished they would included live songs ' dirty boots ' single , which ' bedroom ' disc one comes . otherwise , this re-master makes great album sound even better , bring some those older fans down memory lane bit . if you got dough , i recommend getting this album , if you already own it , but if demos . rock !	1

i perusing my enormous cd collection over holiday weekend came across morcheeba " fragments freedom " cd . i haven't listened it couple years . " fragments freedom " only morcheeba cd i own so i can't compare it group other albums . i honestly didn't think " fragments freedom " bad lot people say it . i'm not big fan funk music but surprisingly enough i found myself enjoying group more funk-laden tracks like " love rare " " let it go " . " fragments freedom " far not perfect because way songs flow together which bit choppy side . i mean first two tracks gorgeous your traditional icy trip hop songs then next two ' 70s funk-laden tracks . fifth track dancehall/reggae-influenced track . i thought various sounds made album . overall sound album uneven . nevertheless i like all songs despite fact they made album sound very uneven	1
i can't believe how utterly wrong other reviewers blasted new lead singer ( baby ) lyrics , melodies production ( bathwater) ! this cd even surpasses their best , initial effort , " who you trust " ! there not dud song list ( like , big calm " sea " " digging watery grave " ) pretty much everything " fragments freedom .

disraeli gears cream breakthrough achievement . their most famous piece work , their highest praised too . , it deserves all this . album fully entertaining . some spots may lower than usual standard , but it doesn't really get boring . length okay , some say it too short , but i like my albums this long . songs then . album kicks off strange brew . though it isn't much opener ( i'd put swlabr instead ) , it still nice song some nice clapton blues licks . after , bruce kicks agressive bass line , eric follows guitar riff everybody knows : sunshine your love . standout thing this song baker drums , course , you can't forget clapton solo . last two songs singles , so album really starts after sunshine your love . world pain got some mixed up melodies , may require few listens get used . i like song . dance night away one my favourite songs album . eric ginger really make this one . clapton rhythm guitar tone excellent here , leads sound pretty psychedelic . i really like drums during chorus . blue condition isn't very good track . it drags , lyrics sound strange it repetitive , plus it isn't fun last two . i like some parts it though . tales brave ulysses sounds lot like white room , song band would release later . white room much better . it album instead , put opener , this could my favourite album ever . anyway , song isn't bad . not much say it , though i'm not fond lyrics . swlabr damn fine track , most fun album . hooks get your head you'll singing them no time . great solo there . we're going wrong excellent . atmosphere set up ginger drums , then eric joins soft guitar then some nice licks . i like jack vocals this . i don't know what happened near end , when eric ginger go crazy play something completely out context , but then jack closes song nicely . outside woman blues i'm not much fond . blues lick repeated too many times , it isn't song i particularly like . take it back got fun start , i like john vocal start , but then it loses its magic . group finishes album mother lament , joke song , doesn't spoil album any way . i like how they sing boy-by . anyway , damn fine album , very enjoyable some nice songs . i highly recommend it .	1
wow . where i even begin ? it sad think so many americans misinformed iraq war terror this darryl worley . first off , i don't know anyone who saying " you shouldn't worry bin laden . " if anything people against war iraq wanted our government spend more time efforts tracking down al-qaeda leader . fact bush jr. not make hunt bin laden his #1 priority one many reasons why millions americans voted kerry . they want leader who stand up protect us mastermind who attacked us not send us wild goose chase like what bush jr. unfortunatly . think once darryl ! next , if you going write song invading iraq least make references it . also , now war iraq our president approval ratings so low . i doubt darryl worley would ever make sequel song staying course iraq . he his managers probably thinking next tragedy cash . hmmmm maybe he $ing hurricane katrina next ... we spent so-far 500 billon dollars more than worth human life lost iraq , all war " ended " according our president may 1 , 2003 . perhaps , outsourcing jobs other countries should extended crappy songwriters too .	-1

reviewer amazon , discussing different album , stated album he reviewing would one he would use introduce alien rock roll music first time . interesting question , my own surprise , one i immediately my own answer . iggy stooges ' ' raw power ' not my all-time favorite album . however , i believe it very essence everything makes me love rock music . bad attitude , feeling it all explode into violent mess any second , distorted , kick-to-the crotch mix , menacing lyrics all say , " this rock . " i would not end introduction rock music raw power , but i think argument made this one best places start . come think it , maybe raw power my all-time favorite album ..	1
since going buying spree this web-site , i added large number unknown guitar heros odd god . i forced give 5 stars most am stunned addition my collection re-rating my former heros . most outstanding all new aquisitions andy timmons . i quite like vi / satriani / mcalpine / malmsteen / others this genre , but it often hard listen whole cd . these virtuosos not always gifted writers often work tired formula give their pirotechniques some framework . timmons rare his total control over guitar matched some astonishing compositions . supreme beauty huge range influences mark this cd very special . only gary hoey offers same quality material well unsurpassed virtuosity . he speed burn , but doesn't make it his only or main tool . his tone inventiveness stand above all others . vi also very inventive , but some his more bizzare stylings hard ear . nothing this cd hard ear , even when timmons reaches extremes his genre he remains totaly entertainig listenable	1
mitch hedberg classic one-liners looked life completely different view . i love his type off-the-wall humor . i can't say enough this cd , i've listened it 30 times already i laugh harder harder each time .	1
meat loaf voice never better but quality songs bat i ii vastly superior . " monster loose , " " land king ... " " if it ain't broke ...

high-profile snafu pepsi bill o'riley his movie roles , ludacris keeps busy . it easy think he not focusing rap game if he into so much other stuff right ? wrong . chicken -n- beer , atlanta-bred rapper third release def jam 4-star effort , far his best album date . ludacris , relies heavily his own talent his crew , disturbing tha peace ( dtp ) . 13 tracks , only four feature established artists . high-profile vocals include snoop dogg " hoes my room , " chingy " we got , " 8 ball mjg carl thomas " hard times " houston lil flip " screwed up . " production team chicken -n- beer assorted order . erick sermon , kanye west , dj paul juicy " " share roster lesser-known beat masters icedrake , ruh anubis , jook . beats provided this team more than enough hook listener , but craftily they don't overshadow ludacris flow . recipe album similar rapper prior two : freestyle sessions , smoking drinking , partying , sex , introspection pimpin ' . ingredients similar other mainstream rap albums but ludacris charismatic delivery hilarious rhymes continue make him stand out . lead single , " stand up " kanye west-produced ( ludacris co-produced ) club banger . it right amount energy punch lines makes it enjoyable club well car . standout track " splash waterfalls . " verses follow progression romantic relationship -- one that full kinky sex . but verses aren't what make this song great . icedrake put together track that mellow background but laced fierce drum loop full bounce . " screwed up " ludacris ode houston style " screwed " music . beat sounds bit like slowed down circus ditty laced lot bounce beat machine . lil flip lends his drawled vocals few verses they flip staying high off weed lean . " hip hop quotables " version three freestyle track always appeared ludacris albums erick sermon minimalist head-bobbing production allowing listeners pay attention lyrics . punch lines come back back back this track . don't laugh too much or you'll miss next joke . ludacris continues improve lyricist despite keeping busy movies his philanthropic efforts . chicken -n- beer served up well fans want large order .	1

when you think great work all terms so this one . this album perfect contrasting two sides(vinyl talking ) , environment side one environment other side totally balanced way . i agree critics when they say this would considered pink floyd " magnum opus " if " dark side moon " hadn't appeared . i'm sure when you musician this kind work you spend all your life searching , floyd searching time indeed . why i afirm this , because this album absolutely cohesive convincing , it unique sounding , what obvious case pink floyd work , they truly sounds different among all rock groups . since first notes " one these days " group creation avant garde piece music , it starts two delayed basses lines echoe device after wind blows suddenly , you'll never listen something like this anymore your life , very creative inventive . second part this finishes slide guitar gilmour more wind blowing , superb . my opinion most intelligent love song ever composed " pillow winds " , what superb piece music , man , it perfect , really , it portrait mutual contribution roger waters david gilmour , waters wrote lyrics gilmour music , lyrics description moment life when you just resting calmly , your love your side she breathing low , waters write genius : - " deep beneath ground early morning sounds , i go down , sleeping time when i lie , my love my side , she breathing low , i rise like bird haze when first rays touch sky , night winds die " - . this lyrics shows absolute lyrical genius waters , it suppose love song but he transformed it into deep philosophical moment deep meanings , all love songs should like this one , music gentle gilmour waters playing acoustic guitars gentle way , very well played , wow . third song best one first side , " fearless " , one more superb waters/gilmour compositional contribution , acoustic guitar riff , immediately captivating , genius lyrics , - " you say hill too steep climb " - , waters point view you get your life your hands when you decide , portraited this song , beguinning he starts indecision , but end song he decides made it happen , - " no doubt your own way , every day right day , you rise above fear-lines his brow , you look down hear sound faces crowd " - . next song jazzy " san tropez " very good sound kind relaxing song , side one ends idea copied all around world , put dog vocalist song , very brave them , this demonstrated they never really wanted commercial band , anyway . side one greatest pieces music ever composed any popular band world , " echoes " . critics like describe this music cathedral sounds starts ground top main tower beeing constructed gradually perfect intricate way , beguinning end without any weak part it . first sounds you discern like sonar sounds played rick wright piano , after starts gentle guitar carefully played drums , it like introduction , preparation classical music terms , waters enters bass playing just after starts singing double tracking vocals gilmour/wright working very well . melody gentle beautiful , gilmour guitar playing he himself said right place , he found his own style this album . middle section it exploration experimentation sound effects my opinion most effective ever made . floyd most gifted group terms sound effects creation , they never made useless effects , they've always used exact amount , but this album effects like whales crying deep distant cold ocean simply superb there no other word describe it , following section instrumental section , best one all floyd carreer . group sounds like orchestra , gilmour describes his own words , " end echoes this kind guitar orchestra going ... i still think this wonderful . " if creator said what else would i say . they finished this absolute masterpiece music total symmetry , after climax they made coda movement like classical music piece , they recover vocal part walk end concluding sonar wright piano sound million human voices ressounding deep soul . if you music lover never listened this superb work art , you discover this kind thing transform your conception life totally different one perspective , irreversible way . you never same after this listening . buy this album remenber what i told you . this album mainly " echoes " pink floyd sounds so cohesive they seems like classical orchestra , it sometimes difficult believe there only four musicians playing . buy it fast you . five stars not enough this album . i agree score given one " kid-reviwer " , made review good any adult would make , below , but only disagree score 9/10 " pillow winds " , time goes you listen this song several times , it increases more more perfection untill you recognize this song masterpiece , so me " pillow winds " 10/10 song , indeed .	1
this album shows just what unique talent john fogerty truly . he goes country " chicken pickin ' guitar work big train ( memphis ) all way hard rocking mr. greed which he lashes out way he treated certain record executives . i am also happy say his anti war stance alive well heard song " i saw it tv " where father grieves loss his son futile unnecessary war which only boosted corporate profits . this album should compulsory listening any teenage aspiring guitarists songwriters . mr. fogerty may grown up california but his heart still louisianna bayous . naturally 5 stars this album i would give it 10 if i could	1
release " ashanti " , artist became major name release popular single " foolish " . many believed ashanti new major name rb , more modern ( less capable ) mary . blige . it because this hype singer album such dissapointment . each song album similar sound sounds very like it produced irv gotti rest murder inc . constant interruptions irv gotti other murder inc members doesn't complement ashanti voice album would sounded much better if it only contained her voice . 1 . " intro " - unnecessary filler contains samples past songs ashanti featured . poor opening album . 2 . " foolish " - best song album clear choice first single . good production good vocals ashanti . 3 . " happy " - little immature but still solid effort ashanti . use ja rule unnecessary start song . catchy chorus . 4 . " leaving ( always time part 2) " - unnecessary sequel " always time " . sounds very similar original only original much better . 5 . " narative call ( interlude) " - terrible interlude put fill album . 6 . " call " - nice beat good enough lyrics . grow tiresome after while . 7 . " scared " - sounds very like it produced irv gotti contains unnecessary bad language . would better without irv gotti it . it still decent track ashanti voice complements it . 8 . " rescue " - very good production generally good song although music goes far too long end . ashanti vocals quite similar tracks before . 9 . " baby " - i don't know why she released this track . it so corny lyrics awful . production isn't great either . 10 . " voodoo " - annoying interlude start track follows quite bland . chorus isn't any way special ashanti vocals become annoying this point . 11 . " movies " - very rb song works well although it isn't well made . bad lyrics but what you expect such immature rb release . 12 . " fight ( over skit) " - awful use time record . it just excuse use much bad language possible minute . there shouldn't need spoken interludes good record . 13 . " over " - slightly bland . ashanti voice doesn't really suit song well . 14 . " unfoolish " - very similar " foolish " . still it nice track add album it adds something unusual , biggie verse . 15 . " shi shi ( skit) " - we don't want hear ashanti sister saying nothing few seconds . awful . 16 . " dreams " - nice idea but turns out very cheesy . 17 . " thank you " - ashanti doesn't manage her vocals well this track it too short . should left off . overall there far too much filler album make it decent . ashanti would much better if she signed record label taken her time her first record instead releasing this rushed job . most interesting thing album images which always bad sign . she show potential singer could release something significance future . until then i would reccomend people avoid this rushed job anything she released since ( possibly download some singles ) . there much better comtemporary rb singers out there . mark- 3/1	-1
hey compilation good way find new bands guitar vader one them if you familiar jet set radio future then you should know them love super brother polysics black out fall out well forgot what seven track called but buy it anywa	1
i purchased import copy b/c it took 18 mos release their last disk stateside . i am first admit i mildly disappointed this wasn't more vein ' long gone before daylight ' . ' super extra gravity ' still good disk - one blends ' lgbd ' w/it predecessor ' gran turismo ' . first half this disk just ok . starting off w/ " losing friend " still seems like bad move me , " godspell " would made more welcoming intro . but once you hit " i need some fine wine you , you need nicer " it all good . it take me little bit warm up disk , but time worth it . love " little black cloud " , " round " " good morning joan " ( great chorus ) . first i thought sequel " then he kissed me " bad bad idea . initially it some elements original , but tune seemed off . after repeated plays it better , but it isn't original . this import price comparable most domestic disks .... it may or may not released u.s. you might consider picking it up this way	1
well after reading all one star reviews i my doubts , but i went out bought it whim . i am pleased say it completely flies face those one-star reviewers . most them referred it emo band ; those people seriously need learn different genres before throwing them around . this band far emo . it sounds much closer punk , some slightly heavier elements , more diverse sound strangely enough violin , which seems add extra dimension music , almost guides you through song . it quite hard explain , so i would recommend buying album listening yourself . it fantastic cd .	1
i actually like this one better than first one , mainly because " heaven not enough " , which i loved show , whatever episode it . i also really like " mouth fire " , " face " , " cloud 9 " , but album whole excellent . my only complaints it would nice both english non-kanji translations japanese lyrics , but would take up more liner note space . also , what up bonus secret track 23	1

this who 2006 . finally after what left band plus 4 some superb musicians like pino palladino , zack starkey , simon townshend john " rabbit " bundrick , entered studio pete townshend not only writing all songs but producing mixin , we who first taste their complete new collection songs since 1982 " it ' hard " , cd great songs production but wrong runnin order ( same problem " who you " ) . who began recording this cd 2002 when john entwistle still alive . they practice 3 songs released two " now then " " greatest hits " cd two simon townshend produced songs : " real good looking boy " ( tribute elvis pete himself ) , great tribute song john entwistle " old red wine " . they practice roger daltrey song called " certified rose " remains unreleased best who tradition . john entwistle recorded many songs his own this proyect but not gave roger pete , steve luongo said interview ... sad thing neither roger or pete took time ask them order hear them . so wire glass result 23 years wait what we hear valuable very good who disc . production mix , leaves space better sound but songs rendition very good indeed . roger daltrey s` voice sound ever some songs , others like last verses " we got hit " , fails little . other hand , pete townshend ' rendition songs he sings , leaves you wanting more better ; it not bad all , but we know he sing lot better . peter .. drums very very good , he even treats songs like keith moon would it . pino palladino justice john entwistle , he really into songs great similarity what john entwistle could . me best one " mirror door " vintage who song derivative cords bridge " behind blue eyes " , ends similar way " dogs " . also , " we got hit " sounds fresh very good song . old songs like " punk meets godfather " , " bell boy " , " behind blue eyes " , " dogs " " sustitute " among others alive new ones . but main source inspiration seems " punk meets godfather " , song " quadrophenia " , who played their 2004 tour . this moment ( complete new cd not yet released ) , i able hear other songs fortcoming album among them : " mike post theme " ( good song guitar chords derivative " punk meets godfather " middle bridge " acid queen " , also " it not enough " ( song selected " single " new album writen rachell fuller pete townshend ) , two others . it seems we finally receive very good who cd after 23 long years . there lot new who material ( or related ) this moment such " live toronto " ( great set list but poor sound ) , pete townshend , roger daltrey ' john entwistle ' double " antology " cd , reisues all band members solo cds extra songs . also some great dvds such john entwistle ' " ox story " tipton , entwistle powell cd ) . last but not least , keith moon ' " two sides moon " . prepare your wallets !!!!!!!!!!!	1

like come back album weezer , this review short . just over 28 minutes long , this album barely gives you opportunity get into before it leaving stage . you listen it few times before songs stop blending into 28 minute stream power chord pep . but said lot really good albums ( blending bit , not pep bit ) . said , this album true weezer upbeat fun loving pop sound . hash pipe , photograph , island sun , simple pages o girlfriend power distinguish themselves fold while rest may you singing but most likely won't make it your shower concert set list . honestly , though , i am amazed ( pleasantly suprised ) how far weezer able push this sound . overall , i am very pleased this album only taking off points length couple duds . if they would included sugar booger , it would five star sure . side note , my fiance ' i doing our first dance island sun . it should pretty amusing	1

when i listen music , i like listen real thing . hank sr. real thing . let me just say it out right : i love music hank williams . his earliest recordings through last , demo through live stuff , radio shows through his spirituals . no one sings ' em like hank . think all this accomplished less than 10 years ! true hillbilly singer every sense phrase . other words , there no mistaking him fake country music today . me this box set represents everything country music should , i thank folks polygram/mercury keeping this great music alive . folks who program modern country radio should listen this set prerequisite before entering into their field . maybe then we wouldn't listen majority current crop country pap out there who seem more into rock pop than country music . i'm not going squabble how ' incomplete ' this set really . add every single recording - including live stuff demos - would make this box set so outrageously priced no one would able afford it . it his complete mgm studio recordings , what i believe title pertains . hank williams truly musical hero mine , true legend 20th century	1

short , this cd half good half crap . cd starts strong catchy guitar , obvious sharp synth parts . thing gets me this bands over popularity genre music around over 25 years . frontman brandon flowers complains other successful new wave/postgarage bands success ( bravery , fever , bloc party , moving units ) they " riding our success " . meanwhile killers go tour depeche mode after they reach platinum status some reason flowers doesn't take hint . he simply become depeche mode 2004-whenever this band breaks up ( cuz they should ) . unfortunately this band lot less talent than depeche mode , seeing how flowers voice overly futzed mastering he uses pitch corrector concert . plus half their cd sucks their new cd isn't sounding much better . new single awful . quite terrible . now i know this review get bunch thumbs down , but i know those people who listened each single radio know nothing real music , music history , or probably even how play instrument , so it won't bother me . if you want real new wave alternative rock check out these bands : braverykaiser chiefsmoving unitsbloc partythe feverthe unicornswolf paradethe dove	-1

i never expected this album wonderful it . much i enjoyed it lead single , " say i " , i simply thought it filled tracks i wouldn't enjoy . this key example us never judging book it cover . this one best albums i heard quite long time . i enjoy every single track . christina voice shined like radiant light throughout . while christina doesn't such strong voice , she holds her when vocally competing against her contemporaries ashanti , amerie , cassie host others . cool dre impressed me album production . album different sound , but it good different . change good , this instance , change exceeds good . " so amazin '" ( title track ) showcases christina versatility . chorus lyrics so simple , but it just enjoyable ! christina talks sings throughout this song . i revelled production this song , too . this album great indeed , but " she don't know " stand out . christina hispanic , so she included some spanish this song she sounds so good vocally this song . it man not going home his woman , because he . " who gonna ride " great song , which obviously nick cannon . this track christina asking nick who going there him now she not there anymore . i highly recommend this album anyone ; especially those who underestimate christina milian artist . i would put this album up against rb ladies who compete against her because this disc just good . it so amazin'mikeisha top 51 . say i2 . who gonna ride3 . she don't know4 . gonna tell everybody5 . just little bi	1

i love sublime many years . they far my favorite best band ever . this very excellent cd truely portrays sublime live essence . however sound quality poor bradley misses few lines songs such date rape , caress me down . personally i think thats makes it better , but non-sublime fans would disagree . definitly must cd , but make sure you've listen " 40 oz freedom " or their self titled album first . sublime kicks	1
kenny dorham , besides prolific composer ( more styles than one ) , one hell player ; unit assembled here : cecil payne , j.j. johnson , oscar pettiford , ' potato ' valdez , blakey , know afro-cubano genre well any - it shows . these particular tracks smoke start finish . " afrodesia " , dorham opener , sets tone great stuff come afro-cubano tracks , #1 -5 . i see if someone bought cd expecting nothing but afro-cubano jazz , they may feel bit cheated . i don't . i suprised when mood shifted , but these grat jazz sessions , too , their own right genre , classic sidemen like silver , heath , mobley(in great form ) , payne , , again , blakey . i think this dorham best stuff , both genres	1
i'm repeating myself some same sentiments other writers but feel compelled say something . this cd good . course radiohead comes mind but this band its own thing , not copycat ( which sometimes i think muse ) . these guys fabulous every song gem . now , how many first cd you say ? see , i think people planes comes tradition great music following progression yes , nektar , early genesis , progressing tool , radiohead finally people planes . they not missed . get it right away . it wonderful !	1
if you're going buy it , here hint . not listen it late night when it pitch black outside . totally freaky ! but this cd rocks !!!! i love #1 , 2 , 6 , 13 . those best	1
well ice talking street but nwa coming out harder more aggressive this sound . man this where gangsta rap got started this album . nwa pioneers straight outta compton one greatest rap albums all time . before them no one talking police brutality or gang life or even yelling fu@% tha police but nwa guts say all this . before people wanta yell g-unit or game man they nowhere if it wasn't eazy , dr. dre , ice cube , dj yella , d.o.c. mc ren . these six men changed rap forever . now everyone want immitate them sound like them , but you can't they too original sound can't touch . people these day don't even give this album respect it deserves . they rather hear crappy tunes like lean wit it rock wit it or laffy taffy . man forget those wack songs man go buy this album blast it your stereo . some songs great straight outta compton , fu@% tha police , 8 ball , if it ain't ruff , bit@# bit@# . if you want get into some hard west coast sounds than look no further than nwa . they invented it they always rememberd it . rip eazy .	1
i trashed sound quality new reissue mountain quot ; climbingquot ; improperly lumped quot ; nantucket sleighridequot ; it . but there really isn't much tape hiss this one , sound quality much improved over original issue . needless say , this classic album , well worth getting its enhanced sound . but hang your old quot ; climbingquot ; cd -- new one isn't any better . i guess i should assume original master quot ; climbingquot ; basically unsalvageable give sony folks break one . maybe	1
i lent this album friends uk warning '' go , try get one these songs out your head . '' it stick mind . once one these songs gets into your head , it doesn't let go weeks upon weeks . when you're finally free , you just may tentatively approach el oso once again , daring try your luck song , or whole album one sitting . what amazing album . soul coughing doing some stuff american shores already making its way across europe frenzy . so you give them credit opening up styles drum bass america , catching up europe quickly rising scene . i mean , you go throughout music history find elements this , probably disprove what i've just said . or you just buy el oso , listen it , hear how different it sounds lot acts roaming sterile jungles certain american music scenes , then zip over across water england or france hear where some music going . first song i fell love el oso '' st louise listening '' . it just ' mean ' . it mike doughty voice pretty much me enthralled song . gritty , slightly nasal , but so much character it made song '' personality '' . like it needed anyway . groove impeccable . i first heard soul coughing single '' super bon bon '' , it took ages find out who after first hearing it . time i found out , el oso released . i can't remember what i heard first this album , but it must relation finding '' super bon bon '' band who it . i must listened song see what they like , then el oso my playlist least 2 years . i haven't listened it awhile , but few weeks ago i hear '' i miss girl '' started getting withdrawal symptoms . el oso dangerous beast , i say . it melodies absolutely baiting . '' rolling '' just its repetitive nature gets you instantly recognise song get it rolling your own head . plus beat just ... well , can't really describe it . you just hear song really . '' monster man '' just kicks @ss . '' blame '' too catchy . i surprised '' circles '' song came off this more well known many . not my favourite pick el oso . it far simpler confined compared its brothers , sisters cousins existed this album , far cry '' so far i not found science '' . or '' fully retractable '' . it really album purchase . my british friends who heard it came back me weeks later asking me what i given them . it worked like virus . they couldn't get album out their heads . most times , all they could manage say '' album great , how you hear them ? '' i don't know ! it took me ages find out who '' super bon bon '' . el oso worthy purchase . must .	1
you certainly see where band should go . it powerful album some senses , but overall , it just good . pick it up , understanding it just good rock/grunge/whatever . enjoy .	1
long time fan movie soundtracks , well long time horner fan , i no trouble all " taking chance " purchasing this one . seen movie several times , i knew i treat typically spanish brass , rhythm scattered throughout score . marc anthony song " i want spend my life loving you " big reason purchase , elements this melodic love song found here there . my favorite track first one , " plaza execution " full zorro theme , arresting emotional segues , setting stage rest movie . this definitely worhty addition anyone music library , especially if they prone loving spanish music .	1
how could supposedly comprehensive compilation vu tracks not contain single cut loaded ? where " sweet jane " ? where " rock ' roll " ? those songs just much part vu legacy anything vu nico , it ludicrous they aren't represented . sure , john cale left prior loaded , but doesn't mean it isn't part band catalogue . also , there obvious predilection part whoever assembled this cd negate all great experimental work band put out . " european sun " arguably significant vu nico track " heroin " , where " sister ray " ? including only " white light/white heat " " here she comes now " makes white light/white heat seem like velvet underground nico part ii , which it obviously not . wl/wh should appreciated dark nihilist art piece it . let real vu retrospective , one better encapsulates band monolithic influence american art . better yet , let not any retrospective all .	-1
this disc features uk edition " off record " , which lacks " stairway stars " , but not worry , since it included amongst bonus tracks . other bonus tracks , you get non- l.p. b-sides " distinct lack ancient " " why don't you it me " , alternate " midnight daylight " (which debuted german 2-cd set " sweet originals " ) , disco mix " funk it up " (a capitol u.s.a. creation made via tape copy repeats certain sections . yawn ! ) , fine previously unreleased demo " lost angels " , alternate mixes " she gimme lovin '" " hard times " which heard numerous previous outtakes cd . my only complaint : tape copy used " stairway stars " audible damage during first second . obviously , it passes quickly , but it wasn't present any previous release song . oh well , it mid-price cd ...	1
david clynick nice job catching mood this album . very dark album indeed . get nice variety lounge , techno , rock , various other beats . nice ! don't need play game enjoy album , but soon you get your hands 360 check out game	1
legend it , it took quite bit convincing get karen dalton into studio record this album , it spur-of-the-moment decision . consequently , arrangements loose accompaniment not varied much--dalton 12-string ( don't hear any banjo , despite what liner notes say ) , guitar or two playing lead , spare percussion , some bass mostly extent backing instruments . fortunately , focus karen voice , which real pearl . no one else really sounded like her before or since , although this album isn't very polished , it invaluable one only two studio recordings karen ever made . although karen played whole lot folk , most these songs blues , some writing great . two fred neil cuts highlights --" little bit rain " " blues ceiling . " " ribbon bow " great brooding traditional tune . title track " right wrong or ready " also highlights . really what ties set together karen voice -- if you haven't heard it , it pretty tough describe it . it so complex , involving strained breath beginning words , kind southern-accent nasal pronunciation sounds , really guttural , emotive undertone . some people annoyed her voice , but i recommend giving it chance--it shame write off such complex gem originality sounding bit uncommon . her unique vocal tools , dalton wrings emotion , pain life out these songs . even though she didn't write them , such impressive readings , it doesn't really matter . two albums karen dalton recorded , this far away lesser jewel . its faults rooted off-the-cuff way it recorded : most backing instrument parts don't add very much songs , since it essentially jam session , playing almost frustratingly tentative -- guitars sound like they're just playing fill space end up just noodling . me , this makes overall feel album downbeat more mellow than it may sounded better arrangements preparation , or if it just dalton her guitar . it , songs kind float all sound very similar . i recommend this album , but i recommend you buy dalton second , recently reissued album my own time . it production polar opposite -- much slicker ( but not overly so ) , much more interesting impressive accompaniment , everything sounds better-prepared . additionally , song choice much more varied -- blues folk accompanied rb , rock , jazzier numbers more pop/rock sounding numbers . i think it may easier fall love karen voice starting her second album , once you've gotten into it time check this one out . it fine document showcase her voice it supplements better thought-out my own time . i hope you enjoy both albums	1
fred hersch points out his liner notes , since syncopated rhythms walt whitman poems led directly bebop beat poets , why not set leaves grass jazz ? selecting 17 passages whitman -- 11 them song myself -- hersch adds four horn players , cellist two vocalists his trio create " small-scale oratorio .

i read excellent reviews this disc her landing music publishing deal paul mccartney great expectations this former lead singer band " moon alice . " while she certainly pretty lady stunning front cover shows , i not connect much music . " different girls " plausible rocker doesn't sound unique enough nor groove great enough make me reach repeat button . australian producer chris pelcer cowrote " swim " rocks one more successful tracks simplistic lyric , " cotton candy , spin me ' round lovin ' tree , if i hold out tempting all my sweetness , sticky sticky , so good . " " radiowave " rocks some great hooks , but lyrics make it seem sophomoric , " like time bomb ticking radiowave ; i'm dancing table strawberry shake , feel like getting down dirty pocket love .

although i just got this recently , i already notice lot songs different than her older work , country note , romantic note , lighter note . she sounds like jewel never heard before , i like it ! it might take while , though , seen rating . so far i only listened this once , but i look forward hearing it again ; i mean , why else would i get it ?! my favorite song here " till we run out road " because it reminds those days when i make those transitions life just decided ride one path longest time . oh , it my latest jewel cd i don't think i made bad choice all . i may fallen it much my older ones don'y even know it yet . this leaves decent aftertaste my mind after nice food thought i given , this album she just may it right . keep up good work jewel ; i am right behind you !	1
these tracks all excellent but frankly several major country duets not here !! where earth kenny rogers dottie west ?? instead we get rogers sheena easton rogers/easton combo makes it almost entirely pop recording it should not this package . buck owens rose maddox track but where buck his far more famous duet partner susan raye ? merle haggard - janie fricke track should not included since she really only just sings harmony record . why aren't jimmy wakely margaret whiting who started male/female star duet craze 1949 slipping around here or kitty wells red foley , first superstar duet ? where ferlin husky jean shepard , jack greene jeannie seely , david houston barbara mandrell , bobby bare skeeter davis , roy drusky priscilla mitchell , don gibson dottie west , johnny duncan janie fricke , name just few famous country duos yore . instead we too many tracks same artists here . it very good package but it should great classic one	1
t.h.u.g.s. okay album but it just doesn't anything give it extra push . not recommended	-1
i like material dvd better than cd . perhaps best performance whole project john doyle karan casey pyrotechnic rendition " wind shakes barley . " ( it dvd but not cd)the best instrumental " bird hand " set . most extraordinary moment occurs when winifred turns make eye contact donal lunny ( very crowded stage ) smacks her bow hand into mike stand . ouch- leave mark ... but her credit , she just rears back lets fly . there old joke " silly wizard " when they played their fastest " only dogs hear them . " well , john doyle john williams just blow right through sound barrier . again , dvd , not cd . seamus winifred recombining different line-ups , i'm unimpressed . imho , john , john karan all simply little better than their replacements . so " pastures plenty " i wanted john playing accordian john doyle singing . ( fortunately , it both cd dvd . ) don't get me wrong- solas outstanding band but i preferred their " starting line up .	1
one my top 10 cds all time , just great cd beginning end . great guitar , great vocals , great songwriting . easily sdre best album , may best album come out seattle grunge scene too .	1
despite remastering , first three songs this cd apparently still reproduced mono . when heard through headphones , vocal some music comes out though right speaker rest music comes out through left speaker . no vocal heard through left speaker . i owned this collection before it remastered i don't recall this happening . i also own two disc hollies greatest hits collection this not occur either those discs . two disc set , vocal comes out through both speakers . somebody messed up !	-1
this seller sent cd very quickly it new described . wish i liked music more than it turns out i but it worth experiment into cw . great seller	1
c/d contained most my favorite sons pioneer songs . however , i disappointed their signature song " cool water " missing last four lines or verse , i . . shadows sway seem say tonight we pray water , cool water . way up there he'll hear our prayer show us where there water , cool water . dan feet sore he yearning just one thing more than water , cool water . like me , i guess , he'd like rest where there no quest water , cool water . this verse could replaced " ridin home " 1:59 .	1
this great album i listen all time !! i highly recommend this album ! this compilation deserves 25 stars	1
any live album dbb puts out worth buying this album least good others if not better . i really enjoyed hearing newer members band whole thing well capture energy dbb show - something usually difficult live records	1

i cleaning out stuff " pocket full kryptonite " fell pile , cassette format , no less . i hadn't heard album two or three years , so i loaded it . fifteen years after its release pfok remains intensely creative , funky , wonderful , carefree . all honesty spin doctors , this their debut album , delivered so much more hang stick than , say , cold play today . there not dud cut beginning end , seven or eight cuts simply top notch creations . i know doctors not able continue this level , but this one album alone practically entire career	1
louis armstrong reminds us through his voice what simple wonderful world we once . this record classic - never fade . even my 6 year old son liked it	1
slight correction previous review this excellent group . twelve girls band not ones performing closing ceremony athens olympics august 2004 . they united states time promoting release their us album , eastern energy . coincidentally , day athens closing ceremony , they scheduled play atlanta , georgia -- previous venue summer olympics . ones who performed athens group dancers . otherwise , previous reviewer . silverstone right all counts regards twelve girls band musical abilities . updated reply region code issue : john , you're us , your code region 1 . it same canada . region 2 europe , japan , south africa middle east . region 3 asia ( except japan , indian sub-continent mongolia ) . region 4 australia , new zealand , central south america . region 5 eastern europe , indian sub-continent , africa mongolia . region 6 china . region 7 reserved future use . region 8 international destinations e.g. airplanes cruise ships etc . region 0 or all region free , meaning all region 1-6 players play disc . apparently , this 12 girls band dvd coded region 6 ( indicated above ) which explains why your region coded player cannot play it . perhaps you could contact customer service now regarding exchange or refund . alternatively , although not endorsement , i believe there certain places websites which sell region-free and/or multi region dvd players us . these usually lesser known brands . also available here amazon looks it . also , it seems there ways , if you search internet , circumvent region code issue , pressing few buttons here there sequence player and/or remote control . anyway , only dvds region coded . cds vcds not . hope this helps .	1
if u like rap you'll like this cd . whole cd great ! dmx , ja rule , jay-z , eminem , meth amp ; red , this group great rappers . gotta love it	1
it shame record industry offers us nothing those over age seven . so , i'm personal quest find new , interesting sounds made actual musicians . few new things actually quite good creative gotten my attention . suzuki tosca fabulous album those sharing my quest . if not , music cool anyway worth listen . hip-hop , jazz , ambient techno never sounded this good all mixed together some unique grooves . i also recommend my two other discoveries those seeking new music , not necessarily all same genre : dancing dreams barbarian lovers dark adapted eye danielle dax . hopefully , these make your search worthwhile .	1
words cannot describe how awesome bon jovi !!! i am their #1 fan no other group this world produces such quality / entertaining / heartfelt music . i recommend you buy nice day all their cds !!!	1

i remember when jesse johnson made his debut solo artist . time , i just kid so i never even knew he member band time ( one my all time favorite bands ) . my first introduction him through song video , " i want my girl " . some reason , this song struck cord me stuck me all these years . i'm not sure why jesse johnson never became " major star " -he should been-maybe he victim times or maybe victim am records . either way , jesse johnson one most underrated underappreciated guitar players which i am aquainted . my opinion , he one best . unfortunately , whatever reason-possibly because he constantly compared prince , his guitar skills often overlooked . although i love his music past it pales comparison music he now . but jesse johnson proved he could more than just time guitarist oft-said " prince protege " . he could write , produce , arrange , engineer play multiple instruments . some ways i wish he would music he really wanted do-blues rock-but given musical landscape time i'm sure execs wanted formulaic prince sounding albums so he obliged them . i am happy he allowed release this compilation because it allows his fans ( folks like me ) reintroduced reacquainted mr. johnson work . this collection includes his hits like aforementioned " i want my girl " , " you help me " , " your man " , " crazay " ( legendary sly stone ) , " black america " ( song also stuck me ) , " love struck " , " baby let kiss " . it even includes previously unreleased track " vibe " which very sexy it become one my new favorites . i would preferred if they would included " yourself favor " , " drive yo cadillac " , some extended mixes some tracks his 1996 release bare my naked soul which his best work time this writing . but i'm just happy someone thought enough compile collection his work-so i overlook what missing appreciate what here .	1
excellent throughout . quot ; carol bellsquot ; version exceeded ( imho ) only david benoit version first grp christmas ( sorry george ) . but highlight without doubt quot ; angels we've heard highquot ; which exquisite . best ws series	1
no way i mean disparage revered , rightly so , mr. robert johnson . there however mr. johnson equal or perhaps more passion ferocity . his name tommy , like robert , his recorded output woefully lacking . mainly caused era recording technology , partly his own disinterest recording his preoccupation ingestion spirits . i believe seventeen songs this album all songs he ever recorded . but they seventeen slices heaven or hell , case may . aside robert , i think few artists ever , so clearly effectively display such raw , painful pure emotion . proverbial deal devil originated this mr. johnson not robert . judging sound his voice these recordings he may actually gone visit before coming back cryptically relaying his torment us through song . i cannot recommend this masterpiece more strongly than say thank god/the devil mr. tommy johnson his seventeen slices heaven/hell	1
take note previous two reviews ! both 5 stars . so my rating . 5 big stars . start finish this exceptionally smooth album . it just rolls transporting you very upbeat cool place . beautiful rhythm horace ' piano , dexterity speed joe henderson tenor brilliance woody shaw trumpet captivating . i normally find trombone overbearing out place but jj johnson absolutely wonderful this fabulous album . much i enjoy horace better known albums , this my favourite . you not regret buying this album	1
although bill charlap sandy stewart consummate performers , i must agree review sharlan douglas . both mother son compliment their artistry so skillfully but tempo each selection ultimately regretfully same throughtout entire album . neither superbly intimate phrasing sandy stewart nor tenderly responsive accompaniment bill charlap sustained interest this listener . however , when my choice limited few numbers , combined talents both vocalist pianist intoxicating one stimulating indulgence fine delicate wine .	1
uninitiated , marc ribot los cubanos postizos ( prosthetic cubans ) ensemble group dedicated playing modern interpretations son montuno it afro-cuban musical cousins . originally informal jam band dedicated bringing attention music unsung creator son monuto - arsenio rodriguez , marc ribot little ensemble quickly drew enthusiastic crowds their east village scene . next thing you know , major label contract critically acclaimed debut album . here then their follow up effort . i am pleased announce it may even better than first album . energy level seems bit higher , marc guitar tone attack bit more edgy side , much more like live gigs . how best describe what band ? imagine this : group ex- lounge lizard jazz passenger alumni gigged everyone john zorn tom waits playing rootsy afro-cuban grooves . highly infectious , adventurous just plain fun , while never getting too serious . proof just listen quot ; las lomas de new jerseyquot ; , hilarious ode nj never comes off too corny . opposite end try quot ; baile baile bailequot ; it thunderous power chord interjections grafted onto traditional son montuno . those looking good enjoyable modern jazz recording rootsy latin elements emotional immediacy rock music , but structural complexity jazz , one needs look no further . album title says it all	1
it all sax . squealing , fighting dominate , makin ' you know it attitude funk ny conquering world what should nightclub every major metropolitan region . but , there only so much james chance go around . lucky us they invented records . lydia lunch her thang him back late 70 . 4 cd box nice but there too much just doesn't work . what you need this album james white blacks off white album . together , studio , where , least official record releases , james his very tight band live forever . if you like funk wondered if skinny white guy could really it , well james your answer . i lucky enough see band 1980 . show didn't begin until midnight . i figure they ny time , too cool play day or evening even . it wasn't disappointing . neither this lp ( off white ) . buy contortions . little bonus trax , i just hope it well recorded material . i speak studio album . it kept me funky ( sounds weak but it feels good ) punky 24 years . james brown gives us real thing but james chance gives us something mr. brown not , he fervent sax playin ' , ny shark skin suit wearin ' ( i assume ) cool guy who just performed all tomorrow parties long beach coupla years ago . i hope he still swingin ' hard . this record sure . chrisbct@hotmail.co	1

i bought this after intrigued tom waits ' comment shakin ' rafters greatest rock roll record all time . if that why you checking it out , forget it because there very little rock roll here . i knew this cd going gospel music when i ordered it some gospel really rocks , but after hearing this i could not imagine what fuss . music , particularly keyboards , very weak singing , while inspired , amateurish . there lot better gospel music listen market than this . celebrity endorsements aren't any better than anyone else , but i took chance waits ' assessment this cd since his tastes music famously eclectic mine well . looks like i lost my bet here , i won't playing this one much . if you buy this , you should so message , but certainly not music	-1
if , like me , you love see galactic live , not buy this cd . i always felt like houseman necessary distraction band keep funk planet . this album all houseman no funk ! crime ! i don't mean its not up galactic funk standards , would one thing . i mean it over-produced , drums so electronica they sound like drum machines . you kidding me , stanton funk soul band ( world ? ) it what they reduced ? you getting point . even lyrics suck . nothing more than repeated choruses . enoug	-1
first let me tell you , when i got this cd only other jazz i listened miles davis " west coast/cool " style . this cd opened me up so much more . i searching cd just this type really showcased all different elements styles jazz . while most this vocal type jazz(bille holiday , sarah vaughan , ella fitzgerald ... ) there instrumental types jazz , which up till this cd i thought only type jazz . this really opened me up vocal side jazz , like i may mentioned before when i purchased this i jazz novice , i heard billie holiday like radio tv/movies(most songs cd you reconize ) but never really listened them . now i find myself listening ella fitzgerald louis armstrong more then any other music(and i listen lot music ) . i also found new favorite song mine , summertime ella louis . i think most these songs found other cd so if you already own these artist cd then you may want check see if you don't already own these songs . but if you new jazz like i , then get this great compilation start . peace kevi	1

i've listened this cd probably numbering hundreds since its release 1978 . each time i so , it never fails leave me wonder . i ask myself , " how it doing something so simple adding single vocalist , entire look , feel , sound , musicianship band so completely change ? " but then i listen it again , i find my answer .......... songwriting flawless , harmonies tight , keyboards greg rollie used their best form . guitar neil schon sings , vocals steve perry carry each tune its fullest . those reasons , " infinity " rightfully come known one defenitive albums 70s . later albums like " frontiers " would take them new direction allowing them rock harder , " escape , " would find them catapulted into superstardom some best songs found any album 1980s . listen love band their home town , san francisco , " lights .

when we got this radio station i work i just shrugged it off stupid emo album ( we get lot bad albums new rotation ) until i heard dj play song " goodbyes " . i usually can't stand emo bands , but this song particular sounded so good stirred up such emotions ( similar goosebumps i get when i hear radiohead " planet telex " ) i decided listen rest album . lo ' behold i bought it week later ! great thing jamisonparker lyrics good enough interesting , guitar work catchy enough get hooked first listen , jamison voice isn't so whiny it annoying ( although i still picture lot people not liking it - it standable open-minded , but it hurts rating its appeal ) . if i could i would give it 4.5 stars . first 6 songs flow well together all good or great rest album not faring well . these first 6 , however , make it very satisfying purchase fans genre . it just barely not classic , but i think that because , though it really good , it seems kind've derivative . i'm not entirely convinced non-emo fans would like it , so warned . it would've easily gotten " 5 " stars if jamison voice wasn't kind've bad annoying ( i personally like it but i definitely see lot people not enjoying it ) . all all , however , i would still highly recommend this ! if you liked this album i would also recommend daphne loves derby " strength all convinced " . highlights include : " alcohol bandages " " best mistake " " goodbyes " " tearing through me " " paper , rock , scissors " " emergency room romantic " " slow suicide " " here everything i've always meant say " ( extent	1

just simple background piano , vanessa stiches gaps all sorts music makes it " harmonium " . it very beautiful album . when i first heard " white houses " , saw movie video , i fell this album immediately . " annie " significant one , it so beautiful , it brings you tenderly scene inside lyrics moody piano carries you final end four minutes . i must say my favorite song light " san francisco " , but i still failed work out what this song all ; it one song sounding quite light-hearted but lyrics i believe certain history . every single song " harmonium " poem . she even makes fast " private radio " sound beautiful . " half week before winter " sounds like world fantasy , but i think she trying tell something . " she floats " eerie song suicide girl . she very like picasso sometimes , only she sings . first i surprised how less this album seems acknoledged music listeners , but world only cares hot beats sex gangs nowadays , i guess i must not shocked . also , these songs aren't exactly what you'd call catching , especially " c'est la vie " " papa " . vanessa , you get something different hip hop or pop . i hope she makes hit like " thousand miles " her next album ... get attention she deserves	1

if you're casual fan looking more than what " 1 " gives you , this pretty much your only other collection option . it also basically later part earlier set " 1962-1966 " , two 2-disc collections obviously go together well . each disc here roughly 50 minutes , while it could hold many more songs , you still get 28 classics here . even without " 62-66 " set this more than what " 1 " , though short their early work . this also gives numerous tracks off each album , including both " sgt peppers " " beatles ( white album ) " . plus course hits " abbey road " , " magical mystery tour " , " let it " , other singles . anybody could add more or different songs this , but it really hard complain when music this good . again , casual fan , this 1967-70 ( blue set ) almost must get 62-66 ( red set ) . oh , i heard their proper albums pretty good too . enjoy	1

fleetwood mac started off blues band late 60 , members mick fleetwood john mcvie both part john mayall bluesbreakers it showed . many diffrent lineups band continued blues-rock band first part 70 certain amount success . 1970 instrumental hit " albatross " one their biggests hits . christine perfect joined shortly thereafter she later married mcvie , she added pop/soul sound band became influentual force band eventually go more mainstream . 1975 things suddenly going change better , mcvie/fleetwood auditioning new members crippled band they came across duo lindsey buckingham/stevie nicks . pair recording soft-pop band called buckingham nicks . they invited join accepted . first time ever , fleetowood mac became supergroup , not only new arrivals good songwriters but they also added something diffrent band they lacked past , unique talents charachters stood out . buckingham pop/rock craftsman capable both writing pop songs distinctive expriments nicks her hippie style onstage persona frontman they never past . now how this reformed band first release together measure up ? " fleetwood mac " eponymous album 1975 almost good " rumours " 2 years later , diffrence there less chart hits more solid album songs . but there still lots difersity many diffrent songwriters melodies you cannot resist liking . eventually album sold several million copies became smash hit . fleewood mac new era just started would last long . it all starts great buckingham sing-a-long song " monday morning " catchy folk-rock sounding pop song . great start great album . " warm days " christine mcvie next . romantic slow paced song great guitar playing . " blue letter " typical pop/rock song , although it written john curtis , buckingham makes best out it . stevie nicks her sexy husky oice sings most famous song this album , " rihannon " . midtempo pop/rock song mysterious it catchy still this day it identified one her best . mcvies " over my head " one best song this album aswell , it got this jazzy feeling all over it . beautiful meliodic . song lyrics simple but sometimes it simple words best describe emotions . nicks penned ballad " crystal " performed lindsey ( but backed her ) one less knows songs here , but it also melt album concept . " say you love me " , great mcvie song catchy pop/soul sound not surprisingly hit single . " landslide " written performed stevie nicks , it slow country sounding ballad somewhat simple structure . once she proves easy going songs works fine too . " landslide bringing you down " methaphor struck love . " world turning " very bluesy reminds you alot old band . certainly not bad , but diffrent rest here . mcvie " sugar daddy " quite odd , just look title lyrics . oh well , someone got sing sugar daddy too . buckingham closes " i'm so afraid " sounds like fleetood meets genesis , yeah it progressive rock . i like this one , but it not hit feels little misplaced here . overall , fantastic album often shadow " rumours " but it actually almost good . buckingham nicks entrance band takes them new levels , more accessable maistream music easier like identify . this album eventually sold millions this remastered version makes it even better . good buy	1

person who , long time , opposed any sort " greatest hits " amalgamations , i first apprehensive buy this disc . i always thought it better buy every single album band , celebrate great songs songs perhaps weren't so great . couple fact i didn't know much this band ( except songs snake driver , just like honey , head ) , fact i broke , this purchase seemed bit more feasible than my original philosophy . needless say , i completely blown away . " upside down " far one most original pieces music i've ever heard , given it 1984 . intentional feedback , muffled growling vocals , loud electronic drums , all made one truly adrenaline inducing 2 minutes 59 seconds . next two tracks , " never understand " " you trip me up " echo this sensation . next two tracks " just like honey " " some candy talking " , show more melodic side jmc . " just like honey " , really beautiful chord progression , really ambient male female vocals create perfect combination . same goes next track . latter tracks disc cover band more " professional " sound , if you . better , cleaner production , full band , created new face band . " far out gone " , features equal levels drums percussion , guitar , vocals . it rather upbeat song , say least . " snake driver " seemingly regression back simpler means . no fancy studio tricks , no back up percussion ; just two or three chords , their trademark distortion/feedback , etc . let jump last track , " i love rock roll " . very upbeat tune loving rock roll . highlight 50 seconds , horn section kicks background guitar solo . it perfect . far track listing , it too perfect this last track . this far one best cd i've bought years . this sounds kind corny , but this cd branches out different atmospheres . parties , walking around , day driving , night driving , early morning driving , etc . it perfect disc any occasion . get it today	1
musings monk throughout this cd harks back movie which much more than serious look man clint eastwood , but one best jazz dvd's(my opinion ) .. this cd chock full unreleased gems great monk , majority mid 60 some earlier material . it stands dual purpose .. alone it worthy way into man since it features versions his well known tunes monk fan unreleased nuggets like all his variations single theme , essential . additional bonus track " straight no chaser " nice way close things out .	1

i just recently found webpage discusses what quot ;d onegal stylequot ; fiddling all , am very happy know two my favorite artists- altan natalie macmaster , either play style fiddle , or style very similar it ( i.e. , natalie cape breton style) ! this my favorite all altan fine albums , though i'm just now ordering their latest . two or three my favorite quot ; high speedquot ; fiddle tune favorites , beautiful , soulful voice lead singer mairidh ( sp ? ) singing songs i love without understanding gaelic words , i find myself playing this one over over again . buy album- it worth least ten times its price	1
when i first heard children bodom i admit i really didnt like them but perhaps i my whole nu metal phase but after while listening slipknot got boring it starting bland i mean wheres first ( solos ) ? but something missing . then i got into metalcore like month them i found odd band finland cob !! they great combing heavyness melody yet not sounding like retards while doing so also keyboards add nice touch overall music but i am trying say i got into real metal because these finnish guys !!! best ablum theirs best songs warheart silent night bodom night bed razors downfall children bodom alright emo sucks	1
i never cared club much , but my opinion rachel stevens going solo gotten better better , come get it album her best material date incoporated ! you some fun spotting 80s influences samples some tracks , but overall this electro pop its best ! highlights singles tracks like so good - nice elctro disco track consistent basline catchy verses . chorus reminded me lot 1995 dance hit ' not over yet ' grace , remember it ? i said never again kicks off cheesy ' 1234!' brazenly samples status quo guitar licks adam ants drum beats . . . getting away it process ! this great dancefloor filler you up it office party ! dumb dumb high point strong track finish , perhaps best track nods laura branigan hit self control , depeche mode some old school 80s goth guitar riffs thrown good measure . crazy boys takes its tune human league empire state human works ; negotiate love made top 10 uk but not get airplay it deserved , this one reminded me blondie kim wilde early material . big hit 2004 called some girls lp too , which sounds like cross dr who theme goldfrapp ! there nothing wrong . if you like your 80s music , then this may appeal you . although its easy compare contrast tunes , i also think stevens well use these influences mix them up her own sound(and good looks boot !!! ) create perfect pop album which wide appeal . well rachel !	1

i'll try fair since she my favorite artist but this far best most complete album aimme mann made . bit more mature whatvever i'm stupid . aimee finds her knack . she not dissappointed us lost space forgotten arm . these her best albums far . but bachelor #2 just awesome . it starts out strong ends so pleasantly . some disagree but you great moving song . she played it west palm her last show i blown away . you also get few tracks appear her magnolia cd which nice . best songs here red vines , deathly , you know i can't say there best songs because it great beginning end . if you any interest aimee mann or even remember ' til tuesday then you must get this disc . it must ! you won't dissapointed .

after success muddy waters ' fathers sons album , chess records decided something similar howlin ' wolf . so , they got young rock stars like eric clapton , steve winwood , bill wyman charlie watts record wolf . results good , although not good wolf older recordings . practically all these songs recorded wolf before , better versions . wolf voice not quite strong it once , younger musicians didn't quite mesh wolf well old bluesmen he usually worked . but this still enjoyable album blues fans should enjoy	1

i find it somewhat confusing so many people pass this record off inaccessible mess . some extent , yes , kid koala dj dj . other hand , this record got me interested turntable music . i'm not dj ( don't care ) , but this one most compelling records i've ever heard . koala boasts more personality through his turntables than most emcees through microphone . this record just full originality . this record you dance ? no . if you're looking traditional hip-hop party record , you've come wrong page . if you looking something non-traditional original pick this up . maybe it just because i've listened this record 50-60 times , but i wouldn't call this record cluttered mess . it may possess slight learning curve , but once you " get it " , it very rewarding listen . some choice tracks would include " fender bender " , " drunk trumpet " , " barhopper 1 " ( my personal favorite ) , " music morning people " , " like irregular chickens " . kid koala takes his originality straight into packaging product . package made up high quality card stock digi-pack 36-page comic book designed kid koala himself . this not just record dj fans dj enjoy . whether you're fan turntable music or just hip-hop , this isn't record you should ignore	1

while lou reed pretty patchy run solo albums throughout his career , this one manages come shining through . don't get me wrong , i love velvet underground , albums like transformer , berlin , bells , etc . but this one seems most redeeming qualities : it hard put my finger exactly what those qualities , which why first listen it may not seem overtly impressive some other albums . but , listened so many lou reed albums , this one always seems fresh . i don't know how it generally regarded , but it seems like it glossed over ( it may hard find , or expensive ) . however , if i could keep only one post-velvets lou reed album , this would one	1
i fan baroque music since childhood ( i'm not all old either ) . but i've only started reading patrick o'brian books last few months , since it announced my favorite actor , russell crowe , star captain jack aubrey peter weir movie . i am reading books order , am currently quot ; hms surprise , quot ; so what else could more perfect accompaniment than this cd ? aubrey such multi-layered character , filled imperfections bad puns , however he great love music he plays violin quite well . often paired ship surgeon dr. stephen maturin cello , music great release this sea captain , pieces this cd fine representations what aubrey might played while assignment or heard when land . selections hadyn , locatelli , handel , boccherini leclair pleasant , soothing compositions complex varied enough they not redundant , range peaceful nimble . while listening cd , i could vividly imagine jack aubrey below decks his cabin asking maturin strike up tune him . then they begin andante or allegro , allowing aubrey set aside his absolutely awful puns jokes so he clear his mind relax . considering some battles he involved himself so far series , he definitely needs it . reading his adventures while listening these charming pieces relax you well , definitely take your imagination some wondrous places era great change	1

i just old enough ( 14 ) 1968 appreciate big brother when they released cheap thrills lp . after many years i decided replace it cd . however reading reviews here swayed me into buying this live recording instead . good move . ordinarily i don't care much recordings concert performances . this different . this great . buy this cd . if not satisfied i refund your money ( just kidding ) . no person even remotely interested joplin/acid rock/the60 or whatever fail find something value here . joplin purists may prefer some her later work , maybe not . but if you looking " chemistry " this where find it . big brother might not gone too far their own , but they sure great her front . really , without this band this time this place who say what turns janis joplin career would taken ? ten bucks piece history . you can't go wrong	1

counting crows third album band starts off song sounds like it written specifically receive radio airplay . although song " hangingaround " pretty big hit , it really significantly different what counting crows known just sounds me like kowtow record industry pressure . i really never liked song much all it " we've got hit " vibe . after though things improve immensely almost 8 minute " mrs. potter lullaby " " amy hit atmosphere " both which great songs . rest album up down . overall it mellower release than " recovering satellites " many songs moody reflective . other highlights include " all my friends lovers " , " colorblind " . this probably weakest crow studio discs up this point , but it still strong album most part	1

this just my style soundtrack . before movie over , i already wanted score . some people may not like it because there parts may more sound effects than melodic material , but it creates great atmospheric soundscape unknown regions abyss . there , however , very elegant orchestral/choral piece powerfully builds up climax cosmic proportions . if you like this you may also like alien 3 contact soundtracks	1
this some best delta blues ever recorded , but enough written . reason get this compilation its companion " king delta blues singers vol . 2 " wonderful remastering . sound these two issues far better than 1990 " complete " box set ( better even than remastered 1997 version set ) . both volumes " king delta blues " employ minimal noise reduction . while this leaves some high end hiss low end rumble , it makes recordings clearer , more full bodied natural sounding than any versions johnson recordings i ever heard . his voice guitar not sound thin they previous issues . i also prefer sequencing this cd over " complete " set , which back back alternate takes . only thing you miss out " king delta blues " volumes 1 2 handful alternate takes which appear only " complete " box set . it should noted , however , this cd contains version " traveling riverside blues " not appear " complete " box set . highly recommended	1

rolling stones selected this album 393rd best album ever made , i looked over first 392 came before it trouble understanding how those could better . introduced his music time when his music able drill right through , i say he should almost outlawed , he so good . i think hightlight album " diamonds gold " which i really couldn't place same category any song before it anybody . it certainly not ballad , nor it social rant ( maybe it ) . melody piercing melody while lyrics such " catch me rainbow , steal me dream " makes you wonder how tom aim straight your mental health hit bull eye . " time " , other reviewevers put it , may his best ballad , though i would put " alice " before it . " hang down your dead " , while talking sad love situation , less bleak ballad than time . then there " downtown train " . first time i heard it him ( it his song way ) , i wanted cry over what rod stewart it . then i wanted cry other things , but really , it superb ballad . first 4 songs album echo same genre almost sung same persona , which rare waits album . he usually acting when he singing . anyway , if you don't already own this album , there really no excuse it . it very accessible easy love .	1

charlie parker catalog overwhelming . this great cd offers parker greatest recordings his legendary career . i've heard few complaints sound quality . frankly , i think it adds charm recording . there some surface noise , but it not bad . some cuts sound like old 78 40 , but modern presence . surface noise adds patina recording like age fine china or coin or antique furniture . there so many parker cd it confusing . although , i once owned yardbird suite rhino , it just bit too much . it you don't time 50 cuts parker , this logical choice . also recommended : charlie parker strings . parker changed way people improvise create music . his innovation now so common , it like he invented breathing . astonishing technical prowess , despite his inner demons addictions . god-given talent	1

' naked ' opener this dark , sad-filled album where tom shear emotions laid out naked all hear feel . this one great song probably correctly judged one best songs assemblage 23 . personally me ' disappoint ' original album version my favourite album where tom asks most important question ' there nobility suicide ?

i nothing but upmost respect vinnie paul . it eats me up he chose this project his comeback music . i can't think musician wouldn't jumped chance band him . ( zakk wylde , maynard james keynan , hell even matt heafy few names come mind ) i respect what mudvanye . they formula . not exactly my cup tea , but it works it sells records . so why this collaboration ? why now ? i can't figure it out . glen tribot ( insert nothingface guitarist name here ) not even dimebag shadow . their riffing doesn't vin playing any justice it shows right off bat . only part this album where i hear any real connection when vinnie playing snare high hat 4/4 . terrible waste such amazing talent . vocals ... some screaming works , nothing special , just kinda sounds like mudvayne . but slower country influenced songs , i fight every urge smash this cd into million pieces . vinnie paul , please find yourself musicians your skill level leave amaeturs your wake ... if you like mudvayne enjoyed damageplan ... you still probably disapointed this cd . if you expecting pantera , some these reviews lead you believe .. well go throw trendkill feel privelaged you able experience metal its finest .	-1
this one my all time favorite , desert island discs . band cooks dorham plays intensity imagination . i tried pick out my favorite cuts this cd compilation disc i making , but i couldn't come up one or two because whole album cooks	1
unlike most people who consider dirt best album i actually think this album which would groups last their best work . dont get me wrong i love everything these guys but i always thought they always seem improve each realese . this record sometimes known tripod perhaps their darkest offering . production musicship here alot stronger than before . layne staley despite poor state health still manages sing beautifully throughout album notably shame you which i felt one most personal songs he'd ever written . i think every track gem , jerry cantrell contributes some gems his own such heaven beside over now which would state group years time shortly after death laynes fiance , where he very privatlty quit group although it would never publically announced . head creeps favourite it only alice chains song entirely layne himself playing all instruments . frogs perhaps strangest song they ever but its brilliant none less quite unsettling listen especially towards end where layne mumbles strangley himself . sludge factory most creative lyrics ive ever heard temendous chorus . alice chains this album particualar never got acclaim they deserved which shame cause there alot talent group they where alot better then most other bands whole grunge era . rest peace layne staley you'll never forgotten .	1
rip layne staley . dirt excellent album , i would argue best out " grunge " movement . layne voice conveys perfect attitude accompany darker lyrics , which genre could only matched cobain singing " where you sleep last night " unplugged album . favorite track junkhead , which chilling listen knowing path layne would take . alot lyrics deal layne drug addiction , but none powerful junkhead what i see defiant attitude towards his addiction " i don't go broke i it alot " " if you'd let yourself go open your mind , i'll bet you'd doin like me , it ain't so bad " . after best dam river rain when i die , which both excellent hard driving rock songs , closely followed title track . radio songs , my favorite definitely rooster , followed angry chair although any these tracks would make nice treat while listening radio . like good hard rock ? buy this album , well worth 9 bucks you pick it up .	1
this simply worst , most inconsistent sellout album ever ! gwen stefani complete joke she completely lost her credibility musicianship all my respect her ( which mistakenly quite high ) . i even defended her side break-up no doubt , but this rediculous . she completely terrible now . her husband gavin rossdale ( formerly bush ) should completely resent his decision her husband except her looks ( he $ -- so so what this much more ) . album : i mention inconsistent . no two songs sound alike . only way you like them all if you just love her voice , however , i i still hate most them . good luck future , i hope you create some good work , this not . way , i hate lead single ( second , sweet escape , though mostly empty track , some upside it )	-1
i bought this cd assumption it just compilation music pieces . it but they pieces musical play opposed ordinary music pieces .	1
during this time period reba started stretch out new directions this cd captures it well . amazon review makes it seem bit like reba " selling out " trying new musical styles , but i think she believed what she doing , gang , that reflected her choice song off this cd -- fancy -- sing her cmt giants : reba special . sincere smackdowns dixie chicks fan expert using earlier review this cd launch massive mound misguided moronities one most decent gracious performers ever grace stage . chicks tried clever liberal marginalization trick right after 2007 gore-chick grammies when one them said , " we don't want fans who put us their cd player reba mcentire toby keith . " i news chicks : no one ever thought them same major league other two or ever . they're used part ongoing news entertainment media ( nem ) fu george . bush , when his term ends so relentless , sickening free pr campaign chicks enjoyed msn.com myriad other media outlets ever since they verbally spit president london . thus career ballooned out proportion media hot air come crashing back earth where it belongs , next other media-smoke-and-mirrors " stars " like marilyn manson sinead o'connor .	1
first hearing , album downer , but this something live sucked . originally written nancy sinatra , " don't let him waste your time " terrific , borrowing its tremendous , brassy riff obscure phil spector production . there ageless twangings dramatic chord changes throughout , which elevate soul , but all-eclipsing undertow worry age death . funereal " disney time " equates portrayal family life kids ' movies pornography . " i kill again " , terrifying ambivalence , seems written point view genuine murderer . " fat children " un-pc , unreasonable , unfathomable . jarvis not stuff pop comebacks . its maker transparently revels idea standing apart times , floating off self-created bubble scott walker end ' 60s . such , it something dark masterpiece .	1
i bought this item my brother he couldn't find it anywhere stores . he loved it plays it his truck constantly	1
i love this cd . thievery corporation foray into dj kick series classic one it sounds makes esl label so great . it though thievery corp . honored make this album you simply feel it tunes selected flow cuts . label ( k7 ) that dj kicks everyone smith mighty dj cam kruder dorfmiester carl craig well release albums tosca , ursula rucker several other artists , they know thing or two dj mixing . first track me - les baxter " tropicando " ... you may remember this old school easy jazz cut docker commercial 2000 or late nineties where dude dinner table , thinks these two lovely ladies moving up his leg their feet only find out it actually mister across table that infatuated ( yikes ... ) . but then you smooth flowing forest mighty black track titled " rebirth " that'll get party going old styled guitar background electronic samples . it compost thing . then you da lata samba influenced " beija flor " , this came out time before songs tin , so when you hear beat heavy " ponteio " just know neither cut their debut album . fun-da-mental collab . them " mother africa " perfect prelude indian ambiance electrifying " rainbow " following it up . beats don't stop there ... karminsky experience " exploration " sort anthem 1999 ... so simple so great , sitar spashes throughout . " coming top " follows track ... if i boxer would my intro music every fight . those only handful tracks . rockers hi-fi , jazzanova , lazy boy , dj cam few others some smokin ' tracks what imo one best dj comps ever put out . i always fan esl , picking up sounds thievery hi-fi long long time ago but this one made me want actually check out dc lounge myself . definitely check this out . it bit older it sort india vibe it maybe not everyone dig , but i still love this release consistency cd warrant international ambience . if you enjoy this sure check out esl other works , " sounds hi-fi " all way up " outernational experience " . sure take look some many other greats their label , like karminsky experience , ursula 1000 desmond williams just name few .	1

i really thought , when i bought this lp , this would improvement . there keyboard mix first cut , but then farner recycles one his boring , repetitive guitar breaks record takes artistic skid there . i notice cd live version " i'm your captain . " this one band better tunes , played ad nauseum your favorite album rock station . but instrumentation stretched out sans improvisation it all gets tired . new generation even thinks this band worth anything must sad commentary state modern rock pop music . footnote : lp jacket round shaped like huge coin . i'ts corny , but far catchier than insipid music found inside	-1
me this album silent shout bridge crossed deep cuts . deep cuts me more main stream three , eye their storm . opening song nearest i heard knife sound like bjork . songs album more textured playful , landscape more populated this album then deep cuts or silent shout . say anything more would take away experience what music all . say i love this album knife would understatement .	1

i can't believe crap i read this album , every song this album great it own right . what you got here very heavy , wicked return form . production , though little digital-sounding breathes life into band gets them out 90 rut they . i would put this album right after reign christ illusion . though this album very solid effort i few complaints : 1- there actually too many songs here it somewhat dulls " punch face " approach because right around middle album it starts seem little lengthy , but thankfully " warzone " , " here comes pain " , " payback " put you right back into it again . 2- tom araya vocals aren so much angry they just really loud . i miss lower " reign " style . don't let slow you down ... but it !	1

i'm just repeating here what i wrote my gangster love review : ignore all compilations " best johnny " , because gangster love 3 hours past midnight your definitive recordings . johnny guitar watson smoked ' em out hall every time he picked up guitar . you hear johnny licks most rock blues played after this , but he played style . i'm not big fan 70 funk scene he took part , but his blues rock roll all-time hits . it right here . get gangster love , top-ten all-time rockin ' rollin ' blues recording you'll wonder how you lived without . these two cds never find their way back shelf my house .	1

jessica began her recording career via song ( i there you ) soundtrack album ( prince egypt - nashville ) . encouraging response , song also appeared her debut album . it sold well but follow-up ( this album ) much better . this album more pop sounding than its predecessor but fine example contemporary country music remains jessica most successful album date . jessica superb voice equally effective up-tempo songs romantic ballads . all songs here originals except outstanding cover show me heaven , song maria mckee ( originally lead singer lone justice ) uk number one hit . although she didn't write or co-write title track , i'm assuming writers knew jessica reasonably well it sounds like autobiographical song . jessica hand writing one songs ( good friend me , man who wants too much too soon ) . jessica future country music uncertain but i , one , hope she makes comeback she certainly young enough so . even if she doesn't , jessica first two albums ( maybe her third , which i haven't heard ) well worth listen . i generally prefer her first album ( although not much ) but this one sold best , so i'm probably minority . you must make up your own mind	1
though i could write rather lengthy explaination why i like this album , i'll keep my praise brief . i enjoy every song this cd , especially quot ; liarquot ; because it sounds like good kiss-off deceitful ex-lover . short , whether song slow or fast , music highly enjoyable if you like tonic you'll impressed quot ; head straightquot ;	1

female vocalist dierdre dubois ekova , simply known here dierdre , releases her first solo album , ' one ' , six degrees records . ekova , signed same label , one my favorite groups when it comes modern-world music lot unique style which deirdre sings so course when i heard she working solo project it no-brainer i'd get my hands copy it . although i am certainly not disappointed ' one ' , some songs take while grow me . tracks instantly took hold me , though , " waiting spring " , " firefly " , " nights white satin " , " close us " , " sweet sticky perfume " , " way love " , " thoughts you " . she sings both french english , infusing heavier use electronics than ever before funky trip-hop smooth , melodic lounge beats , incorporating influences karsh kale " maid love " ekova bandmate mehdi haddab several others . she careful not steering too far sound fans come love appreciate but experiments just enough create something that different what she past . her distinctly beautiful voice equally evocative cover art definitely worth purchasing this ... please check out ekova if you haven't already !	1

" live sao paulo " sepultura fourth release since derrick green took over departed co-founder max cavalera , group first live album derrick behind mic . some fans never let go max accept derrick sep new main man , but it would foolish not give him try . his vocal style unabashedly one dimensional , but he lot potential , ( some tracks show ) even little power . , even though he usually isn't quite effective max , he usually such good job filling max shoes newcomer shouldn't able tell if it derrick or old guy , such tracks " roots bloody roots . " i don't blame sepultura not playing ton max-era songs , but , unfortunately , they forgot few famous songs ( i.e. " kaiowas " ) normally staples their live show . tracks four five first disc ( double bass heavy " propaganda , " tribal influenced " attitude " ) , explosive songs , both sound great , here . track seven , derrick announces " we're gonna play something older here , " band launch into scorching renditions " innserself/beneath remains " " escape void . " " innerself " flawed , though , because derrick tries desperately but fails miserably keeping up super-fast guitars , he ultimately gets lost mix . fortunately , " escape void " ( track eleven , " necromancer " ) fly without audible flaw . songs number two seven second disc ( " refuse/resist " " biotech godzilla " ) 1993 " chaos a.d. " derrick can't completely match max catchy singing these songs , but , musically , these songs sound perfect , just good original/studio versions . other highlights second c.d. include catchy , churning " territory , " blistering rendition " come back alive , " sepultura classic " roots bloody roots " ( which sounds awesome , here ) . " arise/dead embryonic cells " also almost perfect , but , unfortunately , there loud , unexpected , shrieking sound ( which might come derrick microphone ) middle song . now , even i'll admit " live sao paulo " isn't essential classic like sepultura first live album , 2002 " under pale grey sky . " but it still good live set , well worth putting your shopping list if you're sepultura diehard . finally , love him or hate him , i firmly believe , no matter what record label they're under , derrick green future sepultura , sepultura definitely here stay	1

this cd major purchase anyone serious creative work duke ellington . i am major believer despite billy strayhorn great influence ellington , his presence alongside ellington served musical crutch , upon strayhorn passing , duke , first time since late 1930 , forced rely upon his own creative devices . duke output after1967 soared ! without strayhorn , he relegated his own creative devices , he suddenly exhibits following changes his compositional style : 1)an awareness pop music culture , willingness infuse elements keeping times ... 2)a newly found plaintivity , similar aesthetically perhaps his ' jungle band'(1926-1933)days .... dark , richly textured voicings , raw emotional outcrying . ... 3)a new sparsity , importance urgency now seems attached fewer notes musical phrases ... everything seems heightened , more meaningful 4)an overall accumulation influences ' learned ' strayhorn period ( 1938-67 ) , such fuller appreciation their own serious formats ( note : i don't use word classical ) what i am leading up here this : recordings documented here post-strayhorn era ( 1968-1974 ) , namely goutelas uwis suites , totally revolutionary works art duke ellington most intense creative period , my opinion . course , queen suite , 1959 also totally incredible work , probably more accesable most ' jazz ' listeners , format texture-wise , still bears much strayhorn sound . queen suite still written format duke designed year 1944 , his perfume suite : ellington/strayhorn dealing series short ' songs ' featuring variety mood pieces certain formulaic textures . well , get ready , because uwis goutelas , though still basically formatted short song format , totally break camp where texture concerned . duke tries everything rom atonal flute/piccolo duet fourths , damn polka . beauty it ? it all pure ellington , raw uncut , without strayhorn cleanliness . if anything , these pieces remind you david murray octet 1980 or perhaps sun ra ! duke seems believe himself so much here , seems totally unconcerend any need make ' hit ' or accessible all . he just writing here , pure honest deep ly , well emotions he tap made him greatest american composer . result some rawest , darkest , most emotionally intense music i ever heard . buy it	1

there reason sixties rock group steppenwolf still sells so strongly some thirty years after their arrival sixties rock scenes quick succession powerful heavy rock hits like " magic carpet ride " " born wild " . i've always admired lead vocalist john kay singing style , songwriting lyrical talents , his outspoken personal warnings against dangers drug excess songs like " pusher " " snowblind friend " . he anti-drug when it anything but fashionable so cautious careful . concept albums like fabled " monster " or discursive excursions into dark side rock culture " pusher ' , kay always something provocative thoughtful say . kay also knew his way around melody , whether he making insightful social commentary number songs like " monster " " draft resister " or just plain old wailing terrific , edgy songs like " never too late ( start all over again ) " or " twenty eight " , he used combination his lovely lyrics , driving melodies , wild rock improvisation create whole rafter memorable , insightful very appealing rock songs . most them here , those aren't you find their other albums . steppenwolf quickly earned undying support admiration their original fans , finding new listeners through terrific greates-hits compilation albums like this must-own collection their hits . enjoy !	1

" don't cruel " mixes both uptempo new jack swing occasional rap ( making bobby one first successful singers combine two ) then some traditional bedroom romanticism his early days new edition . this album spawned amazing numbers hits , title track only reached #8 place but big hit worlwide , " my prerogative " reached top billboard charts later britney spears made silly cover it too . catchy uptempo " every little step " reaching #3 two more laidback romantic " roni " #3 " rock wit'cha " #7 . if wasn't enough bobby also made soundtrack new ghostbusters movie hit " our own " #2 but unfortunately it doesn't appear this album . album continues " i'll good you " , " take it slow " , " all day all night " " i really love you girl " where only one uptempo rest ballads/slow jamz . unfortunately there only 9 songs this album if you don't count intro outro but material present album top notch , making it bobby brown greatest only essential album his career ( but third album " bobby " defenitely alright ) . if you enjoy this album , check out guy , bell biv devoe tony ! toni ! ton� ! all simular kind music , almost equally good .	1
originally saw blessed light day 1967 , some oldie fans may not realize buffalo springfield actual several full length albums out . can't believe these guys just one hit . anyway , this twelve track self-titled cd reissue several should - / could - - hits far i'm concerned . cuts like " go say goodbye " , beatles - like " sit down i think i love you " , " everybody wrong " , " burned " , jamming bluesy " leave " " pay price " ( it catchy riffs ) their sole hit " what it worth " all make this disc keeper . it obvious this band heavy influence later artists such eagles , gram parsons , bodeans nitty gritty dirt band . recommended	1

this album actually recorded around 1969 during quot ; let it bleed sessions when ry cooder added mandolin quot ; love vainquot ; slide guitar quot ; sister morphinequot ; ( later appear quot ; sticky fingers . quot ;) album however not released until 1972 . hence confusion some reviews this disc . session took place while waiting keef show . just cooder , stones rhythm section , watts amp ; wyman , mick piano great nicky hopkins alais quot ; edward . quot ; this just jam session great sound quality even though jagger gets buried mix . album centers around hopkins , watts , wyman cooder so fact mick buried mix insignificant . this rocks ! this boogies ! liner notes say , quot ; what point your own record label you couldn't indulge whim every once while ? quot ; plus original liner notes mick himself hoot he adds , quot ; i hope you spend longer listening this than we making it . too judge this album you would other albums stones cannon foolish . but still i find it worthwhile addition any true fan stones , nicky hopkins or ry cooder . if you're not tappin your toes or dancing this i would someone check your pulse	1

i write this review i happen listening cd . i'm not hardcore alice chains ' fan , however i happen one mtv unplugged . this unplugged session great , although somehow too slow beggining ( but not boring all ) . all songs perfectly arranged cantrell guitar solos simply amazing . me highlight cd without any doubt " would ? " . " nirvana vs . alice chains " issue people tend talk whenever reviewing this cd i say it impossible compare this two cds which both bands printed their own unique style . aic darker while nirvana played more " tunned down " style , however they both great . i give this cd 4 stars instead 5 only because i think they lacked some creativity songs . don't get me wrong , they sound real good , however i think they may used extra instruments ( violins , celli , etc . ) make it sound little more different .	1
this cd pretty much everything i hoped it would . it great followup acog . only drawback muddy production , however this really good . if you liked their debut then check this out	1
i remember when song ' how bizarre ' came out . i didn't listen modern music all , but it inescapable part life ' 96/'97 australia ( elsewhere apparently ) . everytime you turned t.v. there video blaring you or when you went supermarket it came loud clear through store speakers . it became embedded my memory couple months ago it resurfaced . i never forget line ' everytime i look around ... ' actually searched lyric using google . it came up website lyric , song ' how bizarre ' omc . i went out searched copy song itself 2nd hand compilation . but i get copy album itself ... now i it , i pleasantly surprised . best track probably ' how bizarre ' but there plenty others essentially just good . ' breaking my heart ' laid back country/hip hop fusion some nice dobro saxaphone playing . ' angel disguise ' just awesome . it really upbeat number nice chorus where pauly harmonises himself he sounds good , there some spirited violin work track too , plus don't pass over it melody . ' lingo gringo ' ambient groove combines haunting piano riff electronic buzz-y sound really groovy beat . chorus really catchy . ' land plenty ' really traditional , again very melodic . that four cracking songs row ! favourite mine ' pours out your eyes ' , 70's-ish ballad tasteful violin playing , but best it probably acoustic guitar riff drives song . there also some really fun tracks , like ' right ' , ' she loves italian ' ' run ' . liner notes pauly thanks musicians who worked album , who contributions made it stand out crowd . i certainly agree . zina sings backing vocals song ' how bizarre ' must say she really know how lay down groove ! her vocals main hook track , it shame we probably wont hear more her . anyway , great album	1

but despite it not what i figuring it . songs well constructed acoustic pop strong jazz influences several tunes . interesting use drums loops etc . his acoustic gtr plaing technically excellent lovely melodies . he also something tune or two , noteably creeping beauty , he shows strong phil keaggy influence , which till then , i thought , acoustic sound/composition style close inimitable . he couple tunes let it fall imo also this keaggy feel . reality i not even sure he ever heard keaggy but he might some point . his voice not assured his two nickel creek compatriots but he makes up it sort delicate vulnerabilty . excellent release - must buy imo	1
nine inch nails ' " downward spiral " , released 1994 much critical acclaim despite it violent controversial content . album times so aggressive offensive you may take deep breaths just take what you experiencing . it very anxiety-filled album definitely hard take some . everytime you think trent reznor give you break songs quiet openings he fools you . he plays your mind each song feels like assault hits you hard , heavy fast . opening track " mr. self destruct " , which leads off sample movie thx1138 , pulsating explosive cut . next track " piggy " example when trent tricks us oh so well into thinking he going slow things down bit before pinning us wall again " heresy " . " march pigs " complete opposite some other songs creating thunderous opening then almost absurd candy shop chorus . " closer " , course best known song album . his placement single note piano keys end brilliant . simple , yet still unexpected . " ruiner " " becoming " go hand hand catchy whimsical . perhaps , biggest surprise record instumental " warm place " . this track flows like liquid your ears . this song may one most intense he ever recorded . ambient track would make bowie brian eno smile proudly . swan song album " hurt " , song every word , every line trent sings resonant intensity . this album lives up all expectations beyond . many may turned off claim it just " noise " . if that your fear then go listen lou reed " metal machine music " . this extremely important influential album . enjoy it what it	1

new found glory one few bands i personally say i grown up . i've listening new found glory since 8th grade , years progressed , so band . i am not going indept analysis how band changed over years , because i think people decide themself . i personally , disapointed catalyst . it felt too repetative , it didnt much staying power me . jordan voice somehow gotten higher nasally record . so out comes 2006 , new found glory set their release . first , i wasn't too excited . catalyst didnt stick , i didnt expect this any better . oh , how wrong i ? this record takes their growth new levels . whole record catchy lyrics still blend fun nfg . first single , " it not your fault " , protraits how much this band grown , yet its so amazingly catchy . if you honestly cant say , song left you singing " it not your fault , so please stop your crying now " , you honestlty dont understand concept catchyness . i would go analysis every song , but i honestly feel this record lot more emotion than anything they ever written . i cannot stress how much i love this record , its not just one or two songs , its whole record . this easily best effort band terms consistancy . catalyst its fillers , but this record strong all way through . i saying before , catalyst didnt much staying power i stopped listening record several weeks , but this record just sticks . there 3 things i would like point this record . firstly , man behind boards . thom panunzio amazing job production this record . record not overproduced , which i felt major difference last two records , better songs this record . secondly , no one seemed mention cameos eisley ( guitarist chad gilbert married amazing sherri dupree ) this record . closing track , " boulders " , gorgeous acapella part featuring eisley girls , one most epic musicallys ive ever heard nfg . thirdly , i would like mention song really stood out . " when i die " written chad gilbert father who passed away . lyrics song breath-taking . it just takes your heart away , especially if you read chad explanation liner notes . especially if you recently lost someone , or ever lost someone you loved , i think lot us relate . whole , new found glory 7th studio effort gigantic step band . this record isn't same new found glory anymore . these songs not just songs . there just something amazing this record , i highly suggest everyone check it out . personally , this could very well my record year . even if it won't your favorite record them , this worth checking out	1

verve most shameless when it comes issuing multiple anthologies single artist under titles such " ultimate , " " definitive , " " best . " since they yet release " best best , " aside purchasing all original albums consumer make some tough choices ( or assemble personal favorite list compiled downloaded mp3 files ) . see my review " ultimate clifford brown " reasons pick up disc , compiled trumpeter nicholas payton . there may even more compelling reasons selecting " definitive clifford brown . " one , it includes more tracks featuring underrated harold land tenor saxophone ( perfect complement clifford , practically " doubling " sound trumpet ) . , it includes performances clifford his two most famous compositions , " joy spring " " dahoud , " well his spirited reading " i'll remember april . " unfortunately , present album duplicates four tunes first collection omits masterful clifford solos such those " i get kick out you , " " delilah , " " september song " ( overlooked , muted-solo gem ) . any collection truly " ultimate " or " definitive " would include his work " art blakey live birdland , " not mention his classic flat blues riff , " blues walk , " his blazing solo columbia recording " donna lee . " still , clifford brown may most non-controversial musician history jazz , admired his lifestyle his music favorite most trumpet players i talk . if you're new him , " definitive " probably best place start	1

humble pie band , like eric clapton cream , carried reputation sounding far better concert than studio . their 1970 vinyl ' performance - rockin ' fillmore ' exhibit ' ' substantiating claim , disc under consideration here , ' king biscuit flower hour presents humble pie concert ' , would seem second emotion . although i never owned either pie live productions prior now , i own vinyl what probably their best studio lp , ' smokin ' , member class ' 72 experienced ' performance ' album one finest live recordings ever made . album , especially tracks ' hallelujah , i love her so ' ' i don't need no doctor ' , two quintisential party-hardy songs era . early may 1973 , when king biscuit radio program made this recording band live san francisco , humble pie changed significantly their origins . while their first live album caught band their formative , raw primal stage , 1973 pie their peak commercially , much more polished act . their original lead guitarist , peter frampton , left band pursue his solo career . frampton replaced clem clempson this disc , we also addition blackberries , trio black female vocalists who add background vocals lead vocalist steve marriott . only three 10 tracks offered here (' stone cold fever ' , though listed liner notes , doesn't appear ) also found fillmore recordings , staples ' 4 day creep ' , ' hallelujah ... ' ' ... doctor ' . latter two tracks blackberries modify arrangement , so they quite different recordings . predictably , tour tapped king biscuit promoting band two studio albums following success ' performance ' , ' smokin ' ' eat it ' . four tracks (' c'mon everybody ' , ' 30 days hole ' , ' road runner ' , ' hot ' nasty ' ) drawn ' smokin ' two ' eat it ' , opener , ' up your sleeves ' upbeat , drum-driven cover stones ' ' honky tonk women ' . rounding out setlist cover ray charles ' ' blues i believe my soul ' , which track five first ( only ) slow-tempoed number performed . humble pie signature songs , ' hot ' nasty ' , ' hallelujah ... ' , ' ... doctor ' never cracked top 40 , but gleaned plenty play house dorm parties album-oriented fm radio . those songs pretty much representative hard-driving funk blues-rock band specialized . steve marriott ethyl merman baby-boom generation , able belt out set lyrics potency essential overwhelm already overwhelming decibles generated clempson co . it also fascinating hear marriott offer muhammed ali-like prose songs , blending images hell-and-brimstone preacher modern-day rapper into one engaging , non-stop rock ' roll lead singer . most instrumental work confined limited number chords maximum number watts , although clempson marriott occasionally engage some sweet guitar interplay , most notably ' 30 days ... ' . we also times treated some 1970 nostalgia , such marriott repititious mantra " oh , people we gotta live together ... " allusions richard nixon twelve-minute plus ' road runner ' . while cover specifically identifies ' ... doctor ' " 12 minute version " , running times not offered remaining tracks , but they all run 4 7 minutes ( according my cd player ) . degree which humble pie become commercial entity illustrated fact performances ' ... doctor ' , 1973 tour , become occasion audience participation . despite additional tracks back-up vocals available this disc , i still regard fillmore concert humble pie piece de resistance . this disc arrive handsomely packaged , extensive informative liner notes bruce pilato regarding history both humble pie king biscuit program ( named after radio program 1920 , sponsored king biscuit flour company ! ) . this only fifth recording made flower hour , which would blossom into storied popular production 1970 progressed , so it possesses bit historic pomp well	1

much like lasgo " far away " cd , this definitely one you'll want if you love fusion modern dance 80s new wave/nrg . plus , you get bonus disc remixes live tracks -- i would rather they put more remixes instead ( like those track " " ) , but least those available cd single . this predominantly very catchy electro synth house , featuring mostly female vocal ( strong vocals pop dance singer ) but there occasional lead male ( who sings 80s new wave feel ) . tracks break down like this : cd 1:1 . fairytale ( incredible synth pop dance track)2 . ( super catchy , more 80s hi-nrg commercial feel)3 . ten miles ( more mellow dance track , like moodier depeche , or perhaps camouflage , but female vocal)4 . paris berlin ( 80s hi-nrg feel , very commercial)5 . peace inside ( gorgeous dance track -- chorus specatacular)6 . vienna ( you definitely know where this band coming this phenomenal synth dance cover ultravox classic)7 . dressed blue ( downtempo electro house -- almost reminds me moodier abba song)8 . ultimate control ( hot track . male sings lead , it reminds me something wolfsheim would do)9 . keen disco ( don't know why superior original mix bonus disc . this slow version . very dark depeche feel)10 . cheap trick kinda girl ( trying fun maybe ? just check out title . this pretty horrid house song -- male even guesting sort real mccoy type spoken part . blech)11 . loved like maniac ( hi-nrg retro feel -- reminds me something bobby o would flirts record)12 . deeper still ( dark brooding dance track -- pretty heavy stuff , but mesmerizing)13 . sunday morning march ( short " outro " . non-dance instrumental)cd 2:1 , 2 . paris berlin -- original extended mix better , if you hunt down cd single . united nations mix sort bland , dj alligator mix very euro dance3 , 4 . keen disco -- hit run disco mix heavier euro dance beat , original mix winner , more retro synth dance feel . 5 . careful boys -- campy dance song featuring downtempo verse house beat kicking during chorus . not bad , but better off here than first disc . 6 . bass driven music -- instrumental electro house7 . balagan -- real novelty dance song . very euro nrg , not really vocal . 8-11 . live tracks not bad . perhaps some infernal older stuff because it sounds dated	1

even if you purchase original reprise albums , this collection may come somewhat revelation . sinatra , help nancy , selected his favorite tunes , his judgment selecting his own material this reprise quot ; ballad anthologyquot ; unerring his taste choosing material other composers . result refinement refinement , distillation sinatra during period when his voice rare vintage form . particularly satisfying readings he gives van heusen quot ; second time aroundquot ; quot ; all my tomorrows . quot ; equally memorable his reprise quot ; put your dreams away , quot ; once his radio theme song played his funeral . but stand-out , surprisingly , quot ; i hadn't anyone til you , quot ; old standard that frequently sung too fast or hokey , schmaltzy style . sinatra version simply transcendent , arguably his best ballad performance record . comparison , lennon quot ; yesterdayquot ; web quot;didn't we ? quot ; , though worthy tunes , just don't hold up	1

this isn't my favorite tom russell album , there others i certainly prefer . one thing tom russell , even stuff that not his ' best ' better than 98% what out there . i bought box visions because it includes ' blood oranges ' , song based paul bowles short story ' distant episode ' . short story one most disturbing things i've ever read , song manages capture bowles eerie images moroccan ' random violence/vengance ? ' so well it makes me shudder every time i hear it , almost caused me wreck car first time i heard it radio . well crafted song should evoke emotions , this one certainly me , goosebump city . it reminder not everything that well ' pretty ' . always tom russell , excellent songwriting , but if you're not already familiar his work , or easily ' creeped out ' , start ' long way around ' or his latest ' man god knows where ' . not shudder bunch those , unless it one those catlike sheer delight shudders hits just before ecstasy sets mind goes blank . hey , tom good stuff . you don't believe me , find place where it safe pass out listen	1
realistic one best guitar pop albums ever made , certainly among very best 1990 . melodies fantastic , some catchy upbeat others mellow . dominique durand sweet voice french accent give melancholic lyrics such poetic beauty . melodic hooky guitar could easily turned into power pop ( sister group fountains wayne ) , but this perfect bittersweetness , energizing yet moody emotional , balance sadness hope , like working up nerve your first kiss . production pacing upbeat downbeat songs object lesson how create perfect pop record . ten years after its release , this still among my very favorite albums all time , one handful i ever listened three continuous repeats . ( matthew sweet " girlfriend " among others . ) apartment life also great album , but although sound more fleshed out sophisticated , songs perhaps small notch below those realistic don't hang together quite well . rest ivy catalog good , but never quite recaptures freshness energy first two albums , better mined singles . if you like female-fronted guitar pop bands like aimee mann , sundays , 10,000 maniacs , sarah mclachlan , indigo girls , innocence mission , everything but girl , mazzy star , juliana hatfield , cardigans , etc ., you owe it yourself give sound samples listen . if you like this album , i strongly recommend frou frou " details " perfect follow-up . you may also find yourself seeking out french pop like coralie cl�ment or going back french classics like fran�oise hardy , serge gainsbourg , jacques dutronc , jacques brel listen	1
this cd apex broiling fusion scene 1970 . one most imagininative , compelling groups ever . this their best album far !!!! i saw these guys live " my father place " long island 1980 . jon clark replaced holdsworth tour , but it hardly mattered ( i initially dissapointed course ) . this collection tunes listenable , exciting rock/jazz . it part it genesis albums like yes ' " close edge " . momentous . just beatles dragged their version chuck berry across atlantic , bruford absolute love smokin ' blue note albums late 50 early 60 origin this fine collection tunes . nothing better , i don't care what you say ; this point history prog , they all chasing allan holdsworth bill bruford . they still ! drink right source ! ahhhhhhhhhhh-refreshing	1

killswitch engage one best metal bands emerge recent years . i , relatively new world metal , first heard their song " when darkness falls " " freddy vs . jason " soundtrack few years back . it blew me away , but i wasn't sure whether or not i convinced enough buy one their albums . then i heard song them " headbanger ball volume one " compilation , decided i could ignore them no longer . i went got " alive or just breathing , " unbelievably awesome cd , one few i could play entire way through without skip song . after this album , killswitch parted ways their singer jesse david leach recruited vocalist howard jones their new frontman . although some saw this beginning end band , many others welcomed it good step fresh new direction . i already biased towards jones , mainly because he provided vocals two songs got me hooked band , though leach no means bad singer , i personally prefered jones . now i'm sure there bunch you out there who already hate me now ready press " no " bottom this review . i can't really much stop you besides finishing my critique . second i saw " rose sharyn " headbanger ball , i knew i get this cd . i promptly , let me tell you , it hands down one best investments i've ever made . opening " bid farewell " features extremely headbangable rhythmic opening , goes display what this band all : good amount heaviness , good amount melody , overall sense power . " take this oath " up next , though it not memorable " bid farewell , " it still good song . " when darkness falls " one best songs album . it slightly ( very slightly ) altered its original version , but it retains its greatness nevertheless . " rose sharyn " follows , perhaps most popular song cd . this popularity justified , it too one best songs found here . " inhale " melodic instrumentalopening " breathe life , " rather heavy track , when it relents its heaviness chorus , expresses message optimism hope ( themes appear recurringly throughout cd ) . title track up seventh , though some find it too melodic their tastes , i think it good example killswitch lighter side . " declaration " similar " take this oath , " if only due fact neither memorable first . after few listens , though , this song grow you big time . " world ablaze " epic track inspiration , one album high points . its awe-inspiring finale leads straight into " ... embers rise , " sedate melodic instrumental . " wasted sacrifice " yet good song , one which also possesses good message taking action what you think right . " hope ... " , last song album , one my favorites , it features great work band whole . special edition this cd ( which i happily paid , even though i own original--it just good ) features howard jones ' take " irreversal , " song band self-titled debut . he pretty good job , but his vocals occasionally get lost mix . it also contains new song " my life yours , " decent song suffers same vocal problems one before it , well live versions " life lifeless , " " fixation darkness , " " my last serenade " ( jones fantastic job all them ) . only problem i cd " resident evil mix " title track . not only it radio-friendly , edited version , but it totally unnecessary . besides , though , this one best metal cds i've heard long time ( shadows fall " war within , " god forbid " gone forever , " trivium " ascendancy " ) . if you're reading this review you don't this album , then stop wasting your time ; get out there get it	1
i've one ryan albums , " day " my favorites pile several years . great album way . anyway , i listening live365 tonight , happened come across his latest cd " beautiful " , i say , " what else would you name it ?

i listened this lp several times . air supply makes most beautiful music our time thequot ; book lovequot ; nothing short . though song quot ; all you wantquot ; lacks harmony repetitive lyrics it erotic song . quot ; when i sayquot ; quot ;d aybreakquot ; very powerful ballads songs deliver quot ; air supplyquot ; quality we come love . my most favorite song album quot ; lets stay together tonightquot ; far best album . vocals fantastic , chords strings really deliver different sound . point song some ramp ; beat it very good . even if song lasts 6:47 min . it doesn't matter becuse this song go forever . quot ; oncequot ; beautiful song lp , it intsrumental it take your breath away . graham russell produced wrote all music i hope mr . russell keeps up great arrangements like quot ; book lovequot ; . maybe future we here more air supply air waves becuse radio stations must sleeping when this one came out	1
i slightly aware chris rea occassional airplay/videaos , but only really heard lot his music my xm , xm cafe channel particular . i enjoyed it enough actually buy his cd . this album excellent sampling his work over years , much variety . bluesy rock tunes , nice ballads , etc . i particularily like his vocal delivery compbined some very nice guitar work . i think comparisons style content leonard cohen made , only chris more musical , my opinion . or maybe i just like small night club groove wonderful strat guitar rythyms . i used my free pepsi itunes winner get song i liked isn't this album , quot ; looking summerquot ;	1

you push play party comes . party ridicules song , shortly after it jumps into khashoggis ship which sucks . then what you get miracle which very pop sounding dumb . after you get average rocker i want it all . then you get strange invisible man tune . then you get happy stupid breakthru . after comes track rain must fall which nothing special . scandal next song which quite dull . then you get lame my baby me followed average it all worth it . 2/5 review i just gave you not my real review , it simply way looking miracle through eyes mainstream music fan anyway my official review goes more like this : party honestly not too good , but it some catchy moments . khashoggi ship alot like party but better . so far not too impressive . miracle next excellent song indeed . next song quite solid i want it all , which quite superior single version . invisible man very good song . breakthru awesome don't stop me now esque song . rain must fall doesn't make lot noise but enjoyable . scandal awesome song where freddie puts his all into it . my baby me- some reason pretty good after while finally it all worth it classic great finish . extras : hang there cool song deserves listened main tracks . chinese torture cool especially if you like brian may guitar playing . invisible man 12 " version okay . i honestly think this album any queen fan not pass up . tracks really make this one 5 stars miracle , i want it all , breakthru , scandal , it all worth it all seriously great songs	1
this cd great . it not only some steve greatest hits it also five unreleased songs . so it ulmost like new cd songs you haven't heard . this cd must all steve perry fans . i loved it	1
this currently one my favorite cds right now . i considered getting lp , but i wanted able upload it my computer , so i opted cd . only after listening it couple times , i able fully enjoy it . it less accessible than " unseen " , which i think better than this . ( download " astro travellin " ) yet , it still some pretty sweet tracks . " closer f/ mf doom " " don't blink " stand out particularly . i got into madlib last year when i discovered madvillain . mf doom rough voice good , but madlib beats insane . here i discovered indie hiphop . there i learned his other projects , yesterday new quintet , , course , quazimoto . his sped up voice holds up full album , even though i wasn't sure it would . i would reccomend you buy " further adventures lord quas , " but before you , get " unseen .	1
my title beyond true . it now 2005 , i've this cd 10 years now . it only cd i've ever owned , every song good . i never like every song cd , except deluxe !!! i got this cd christmas ' 95 , listened heck out it . then i lost it after 2 years or so , found it probably 3 1/2 years ago . when i found it i very happy , i've gone back listening it often possible ! it still good any cd out there !!!!!	1
1980s looking bright individual beatles , least beginning it . john lennon re-enter studio record his album double fantasy after 5 years spent father sean . paul mccartney freed himself constraints leading band starting work mccartney ii , his first solo album since 1971 ram ( although i consider his wings albums paul his alone ) . ringo starr hitting very rough patch musically , but personally he over moon after meeting woman who would become his second wife , actress barbara bach . george harrison , he midst personal joys himself , married one his personal assistants dark horse records , olivia arias , then witnessing birth his only child , dhani . musically , he holding steady after 1979 self-titled album reasonably well , top 20 hit " blow away " . supposedly , george began work somewhere england almost immediately afterwards , said ready record stores around fall 1980 . but dark horse parent company , warner bros . records , not really care final product , insisted george re-enter studio record new material . naturally , he none too happy this proposition , but acquiesced , making sure some new songs hit company right where they hurt . it wonder they considered revised album worth release this time , so somewhere england last hit racks early summer 1981 . if one good thing came these interminable delays , it song returned george top 10 first time since 1973 " give me love [ give me peace earth ] " . shortly after george went back into studio second time , his old friend beatle mate john lennon brutally murdered , causing not just friends family mourn , but entire world . paul would write record " here today " his tribute john his 1982 album tug war . george beat him marketplace his own elegy , " all those years ago " , which wonderful twist fate became unofficial beatles reunion over decade before anthology . ringo starr agreed play drums song , while paul his wife linda sang backing vocals . add engineering geoff emerick string arrangements george martin , it labor love john smiling above . sprightly country-rock-tinged number deservedly peaked #2 charts , manages pay unique tribute john lines " they've forgotten all god/he only reason we exist/yet you one they said so weird " . odd coming deeply religious man like george , man who uttered infamous " beatles bigger than jesus " remark recorded " god " , which he doubted his very existence . although i am sure john would appreciated irony . like song , somewhere england mostly upbeat affair despite blackness original cover restored reissue , one things warner brothers wanted changed . " life itself " heartfelt tribute olivia , shows george softened somewhat new love . " which i lost " not obvious anthem , but chorus seems indicate one : " i need someone show me/illumine my consciousness/remove dark me " . maybe last he found it . even potentially mournful song like " teardrops " positively buoyant borders almost new wave . this particularly applies songs which george striking out against record company backroom boys telling him what . " blood clone " " unconsciousness rules " show cynical wit george always , towards end his life , would get sharper . fact warner brothers agreed release such potentially libelous tunes means they either missed or got joke completely . attitude like , perhaps it no surprise george recorded less less over years . when artist who fine songwriter george , should they ever include covers album , could mean they running out ideas . who knows if case somewhere england , which featured two them . maybe it george underhanded dig recording material his label would rather him . either way , hoagy carmichael " baltimore oriole " " hong kong blues " manage fit somehow , showing george great interpretor well creator standards himself . someone who helped organize concert bangladesh , george always sociopolitician heart , somewhere england still allows those opportunities preach ever so slightly . " writing wall " seems more cynicism its veins , if george throwing up his hands defeat world too much state disrepair saved . but album closes more optimistic vibes " save world " , continuing album primary mood bounciness . while still bit biting its wit , george not lose faith even song first line : " we've got save world/someone else may want use it " . truer words never spoken , ones john would certainly written . george dark horse albums now finally back print after several years out it , it would nice if bonus tracks somewhere england more plentiful . four songs said not made final cut could welcome additions rather than just demo " save world " , which not patch version finally reached fruition . george harrison may little ticked off his record company nitpicking over somewhere england , but he still well enough himself creating one his better albums , my opinion . soundwise , it proved george ready transfer into high-gloss high-concept atmosphere 1980s , route paul would continue well . but maybe george battles his label sap him some enthusiasm , his follow-up gone troppo ( 1982 ) would commercial disaster , often ranked his worst album ( considering 1974 dark horse george insistence recording touring it while battling severe laryngitis , speaks lot ) . however , even if bloom off rose when it came records george , somewhere england showed he could still give it old college try when he wanted . first foremost , he proved when record business tries interfere productivity , one should thrive , not cave	1
i eagerly awaited arrival this cd wanting hear some new rockabilly bands i not familiar , but i severly dissapointed . quality tracks this cd mediocre best some just downright bad , two standout tracks red hot real gone spinouts(great tune , good hook , excellent slap bass , guitar interplay)the other standout girl my dreams , peter wolves very elvis , maries name era early sixties sounding . majority other tunes just dowright pitiful . if you new rockabilly scene , few helpful suggestions , stray cats , blasters , robert gordon , planet rockers , sun era 56-59 elvis , carl perkins , gene vincent , eddie cochran , list goes better spent dollars quality rockabilly music , apologies these artists , but if this current state rockabilly , please somebody help us !!!!!	-1
i'm not happy negative reports people provided here . my inital exposure clever lyrical content poe initally through conjure one cd i've since bought her other solo material addition these collaborative efforts . poe definately fan milwaukee . songs content this cd engaging light pop orientation vein dj armin van burne , balligomingo , enigma , delerium . i've getting into act this genre called collide band happens my favorite genre . this album however , played daily my ipod last two weeks . i can't get song " extra ordinary ways " out my head . if you like these other bands then this line up great . i'd love chance see how they collaborate some behind scenes stuff how rhyes ( spelling ) worked these other artists how his collaborative procesess work . i also secretly wonder if he hip other projects out there outside this genre like dream theater ? well , if you like pretty or vocal trance music this you . it more poppy flavor than energizer bunny trance sounds definately more loungy . enjoy it	1
first off i like bolton early work late 70 mid 80 . bolton first albums blackjack 1979 , worlds apart 1980 , michael bolton 1983 , everybody crazy 1985 all pretty good melodic rockers , but this end . soul provider beginning soul failure . only good songs here how we lovers you wouldn't know love . these songs catchy chorus rock somewha t.t he rest album garbage . why you sell out bolton ? it such shame what could . if bolton stayed melodic metal/rock path he would rocker still this day most likely dam good one like he early mid 80 . it cryin shame	-1
all i say i thrilled i found cs stevie all his greatest hits . i am 80 freak so you imagine how happy i find this cd . what made me happier i got my cd 3 days listening it everyday since then ..	1
well , i bought this cd because my son , neil harrison , loves marc anthony tina arena song " i want spend my lifetime loving you " , which played end movie . he heard song first time when he around two months old , i noticed he loved it , so i played end movie over over over until he went sleep . i figured it easier buy cd play it him bedtime , so that what we , i sing it him cd he goes sleep peacefully . i think if my baby liked it , it get great review ! i loved all other songs too , it great cd	1
i loved every dmb album up until this one . after 10 years making most profoundly wonderful music , law averages finally kicked dave crew . i fan since 1997 loved everything this band . every album every song superb ! this album hugh departure tradition dave matthews band all true dmb fans know love . this album also made division old hardcore dmb fans ( fans real band includes all 5 members ) new dmb fans ( " i heard it radio liked it " fans)this album not include all 5 members leroi boyd almost non-existent leaving just guitar , bass , drums ie . meat potatoes band . every band guitar , bass drums making them sound just like every other band out there . now how many bands you know fiddle sax/wind instruments them ? dmb used one them . you won't find adrenaline pumping fiddle solos or heartfelt wind work this album . next we dave playing electric guitar co-writing majority songs over weekend boy it show . he co-wrote these songs new producer glenn ballard who plays piano this one well . only song work art lyrically space . i also like everyday well only because its evolved form true dmb song , #36 ( hani hani ) . this one real treat see live band sometime play both #36 everyday together . yes i say again ... dave plays electric this one . big mistake going what your traditionally known acoustic then going directly electric ... just ask dylan this one . i felt like i it assault my ears took my breath away not good way . my jaw dropped floor disbelief i just could not believe what i hearing . this not dave matthews band ! only song electric worked space due it dark sad ending relationship . great poetry lyrics one song saves star 1/5 . there lot reviews here saying it took few listens before they really liked it . i believe these fans just denial i can't blame them . it take few listens before you fell love this band ? when i first heard crash into me too much i just floored could not believe sounds i hearing . not this so called dmb . band sax fiddle makes it work !!?? wow ! take 4 things out make dmb , dmb you get mediocre any band . 4 things make formula dave matthews band work uplifting awe inspiring explosive fiddle solos boyd ( ants marching ) , emotional wind works leroi ( say goodbye ) , dave lyrics ( #41 i'm not big fan dave vocals but thats every album ... i wish they would put out all instrumental album ) , tricky timings , rhythms , beats carter ( #36 live red rocks ) , all which pretty much not exist this album . this not dmb if you buy it least you won't buy it under false pretense your buying dmb album . go get any other album besides this stand up ( which even more disappointing then everyday)hardcore dmb fans ... you warned	-1

atb one most talented artists i come across long time . his music very differentiated unique . very listenable whether you driving your girlfriend , relaxing beach , sailing out deep blue , or just plain mellowing out your sofa or favorite chair ( not mention moving sensually across dance floor ! ) . it romantic , nostalgic , hot , cool , sexy , temperamental .... awesome ! i can't get enough his music . great music all ages who enjoy fresh , experiential sounds tease imagination tempt memories young old alike . take trip ... buy atb music ... revisit your past while connecting future ( i know ... sounds weird ... but it happens )	1
story tim buckley disquieting familiarity - dead 28 he already through classic cycle : raw prodigy , hot property , creative disillusionment , unpopular experimentation , bitter confrontations industry executives . many gems produced during his brief , intense career - happy sad shines most brightly . buckley emerged fully formed folk singer , one many time . 12-string guitar rang out lush strong , astounding voice dancing far wide across 4-octave range , he made very compelling one-man show . buckley voice slightly reminiscent steve winwood's; it same choirboy spirituality . some his high notes simply chilling . time he made happy sad , buckley looking milieu melded jazz folk - no easy trick , but he manages it flawlessly here . this cd feels very integrated , otherworldly sensibility flows seamlessly one track next . said , he clearly taking creative risks , jazzy detours not endear him his folk following . using his voice both storytelling vehicle improvisational instrument , buckley jams other players , most notably ethereal vibes david friedman . happy sad , tim buckley seems bound determined avoid generating hits suited airplay , almost if he deliberately thwarting studio executives . this his most commercially successful project , however , not saying great deal . find rainy day person you love , nail door shut . there special magic this cd doesn't come very often . while buzzin ' fly gypsy woman stand out , every moment happy sad something wonderful tell you .	1
all their albums together , this my favorite . first , impulse out this world job remastering recording , so it sounds like it recorded yesterday . second , both kai jj tip-top shape doing some really great tunes . solos just wonderful blend so well . finally , who beat sidemen this album , c'mon , bill evans ? paul chambers ? roy haynes ? spectacular album ..	1
not many studio albums ever made make you feel like you live concert . this true gem . great piano !!!!	1
this cd raw electric - one my all time favorites . i agree one reviewer who said he keeps trying find r.l. cd this much energy , but can't . i doubt we ever . if you like " quieter " , more traditional style " too bad jim " , you may not find this your taste . but raw power emotion , you won't find anything else like it . i think that why i've played it so much over past 5 years - it just different . first you get lulled " over hill " then crashed into " alice mae " . also , check out often overlooked gem this collection - " tribute fred " . range this cd big style allows . you'll reach this whenever you don't want hear same old sounds	1
past couple years , aaron funk spat out music prolific pace possibly only succeeded merzbow or perhaps scott herren under his batch different pseudonyms . i listened much what funk released venetian snares , while i appreciate what he creates , i am often left cold his work . each album he put out , there always one or two tracks slam my ass , then handfull pretty good , but remainder seems just pound my brain into peaceful submission doesn't really care process it all after awhile . relative terms , rossz csillag alatt sz�letett took little bit longer funk complete , after i'd read several places it easily his most melodic work yet , he learned play violin , even some trumpet release , i started wondering just what tricks he up his sleeve . it turns out , this release definitely least partial turning point funk artist , it mixes his usual hyper-crisp beat programming strings , horns , piano , lots other elements his most musical interesting release yet . after opening track " sikertelens�g " rolls forty seconds dark inprovised piano noodlings , " szerencsetlen " starts off album proper quick bursts string samples flow dash like horror-movie soundtrack spliced together chase-scene before sweet snare-rush blasts familiar amen break start hammering away . track progresses , even more strings pile onto mix , delicious string scampers raise tension even more . " ongyilkos vas�rnap " reworking hungarian track billie holiday turn covered , funk samples holiday sprinkles slow , churning rhythm some sprinklings rhodes piano great effect . if you believe it , there tracks release completely beat-less ( like dark " felbomlasztott ment�kocsi " " galamb egyed�l " ) they don't feel all out-of-place release . fact , tracks act great breathers release almost exclusively runs shadows . all those wondering if release complete change venetian snares , rest assured there still plenty mind-bending hyperactive beat workouts . " m�sodik galamb " opens quick horn stabs even some random spoken-word phrases but soon bursts into frenetic , laser-blasting , horn string nightmare . likewise , " k�tsarku mozgalom " opens layers overlapping strings before cranking up into spastic drill-and-bass attack rises falls goes every which way course almost eight minutes but never , never boring . if i one complaint release , it funk seems use some same drum programming sounds ( amen break serviced quite well different variations ) several times during course album , but given variety rest instrumentation release , it something that not worth quibbling . this now venetian snares release my collection i most assuredly reach nearly every time i wish listen something venetian snares now . other words , even if you haven't enjoyed his previous work , this one might it you . ( almost cool music reviews	1
i bought this cd , desperate new no doubt songs expecting something just pretty good , since it album mostly b-sides songs scrapped before they could make it onto any original no doubt cd . i'm really glad i get it because this cd completely exceeded my expectations . these songs not sound like rejects . they're all good enough made it onto albums they originally recorded . remixes also great . it like listening brand new , original no doubt cd , which we're not likely get while . this definitely must-have any no doubt fan	1

good title ep here , that sure . 9 tracks ? i think they could just entire remix album bonus tracks , or , just make new album altogether . i really liked cover art hau ruck , i can't say same this one , it rather bland . friend mine pre-ordered t-shirt , i didn't really want wearing ruck zuck t-shirt , adios or drug against war shirts looked much better . anyway , anyone who pre-ordered direct kmfdm store , it wasn't exactly best deals , considering they're selling it here more or less same amazon . 1 . free your hate ( kaptn krunch mix)- very disappointed this . i liked original speed it just really rockin ' feel it . i think it lost anything good it . it sounds slow , taken apart . don't get me wrong , it sounds good here , but i hoping faster remix , upbeat techno rhythm or something like . after awhile i hoping some guitar or beat would bust it would get really good , it turned out not bad though . not really good opener ruck zuck . 2 . mini mini mini ( . hogstorm rain city swingin ' samples mix)- considering this cover song , this isn't entirely unexpected . original 60 apparently , i don't listen 60 music , but remix seems fitting here . first french song kmfdm i'm fairly certain . i enjoyed it this way better , doesn't go rest ep though . 3 . professional killer ( one only mix)- i really liked this one . i think it probably most prominent track ruck zuck kmfdm premiering it showing it off longe before any other track . first it just previews , but i think it up myspace , amount listens clearly indicate its popularity . professional killer great hau ruck , but this much better far . i thoroughly relieved when i heard this , ruck zuck looking better . 4 . ready blow ( dwarves mix ) - nothing notable here . original dragged bit , but one my favourite tracks . i would say this really good remix though . i believe jules part this band called dwarves , which sascha konietzko referred jokingly retarded . i didn't find anything special or strikingly unique this one , although it quite good . 5 . hau ruck ( spezial mix)- good remix right there . finally some driving guitars really beat original . original good , but this one just get really alive . 6 . real thing ( nude mix)- i think only fitting word original boring . this didn't really pick up pace all . but , i liked it better than original , remix made it alot better listen . i like diversity remixes ruck zuck , this really calms you down , before der mussolini . 7 . der mussolini- only new song album so speak . cover classic daf song which very popular germany . i haven't heard original , i doubt many other people . i like song here it reminds me helmut ! mein helmut ! beat all kmfdm fan anxious new song should really impressed this one . it german , but lyrics really simple straight forward , considering there total 5 lines chorus , that all that sung throughout song . it oringinally dance classic , i think kmfdm lived up those standards this one really upbeat . 8 . wwiii ( one only ' extended ' mix)- best song ruck zuck . vocals completely rearranged , i think song would sounded better original vocals , but i like beat this song , really hard heavy compared everything else . ruck zuck , this song closely resembles der mussolini . really enjoyable track which relentless it pounding beat . bit late releasing remix wwiii considering it came out 2003 . why not this wwiii live ? i don't know , but i suppose it gives ruck zuck variety , this certainly isn't filler . 9 . ansage - i noticed reviewer gave this 5 stars . why ? it narrative , it shouldn't even rated . this isn't anything like " dogma " narrative xtort . one , this very little background sound , it isn't dorona or cheryl this , it sascha . translation good message , i like it , but if you don't speak german , i don't see how you enjoy listening someone speak language you don't understand . there some english mixed i believe , but very small amount . fun rocking this one . good ep , apparently they tour it . i'm impressed this there really wasn't any filler here all . great news . i'm hoping catch them north bay .	1

named profile section , this my personal top 5 . reasons twofold : it live , brownie there . there something live , when it right - like duke ' 56 newport , diz ' 57 , joao montreaux ' 85 - calls history into sharp focus . this , volume 2 . sure , there ' clam ' or two , like donaldson harmony coming back quot ; split kickquot ; , but it makes it human , more fun . tempos smokin ' without pushed too fast ( blakey makes sure it ) give-and-take players , well conversing mc pee wee marquette , blakey intro quot ; night tunisiaquot ; give feel event . horace silver lou donaldson perfect brownie , blakey plays loose fast this gig . curly russell rounds out quintet . if you like your bop hard soulful , you definately dig this	1

my wife elvis fan , but even i enjoyed listening most christmas songs presented this album . couple songs little too " bluesy " me	1
i always opinion who 1970 live album " live leeds " , often named one ofif not bestlive albums ever made , overrated . i felt they weren't very energetic , didn't play their best overall weren't really fire . i mean , i really always liked it , but didn't feel it worthy lot its praise . i myself always preffered " live isle wight festival 1970 " ( belatedly released 1996 , but worth wait ) . however , after hearing this deluxe edition album , i safely say my opinion changed better . newly improved sound quality greatly helps album quality wise . energy level seems much more apparent , especially songs like " substitute " " shakin ' all over " . i now see why album so highly regarded . i'm still debating whether i still prefer " live isle wight " or this . i hve not listned " tommy " performance second disc , but i'm sure it brilliant . i say liner notes excellent , first disc alone makes this cd must	1

what great work . when i first listened soundtrack , i taught i mistaken . first track begins same thrilling guitar flamenco beats " mask zorro " but james horner went even further this soundtrack , composing score total continuity previous zorro . same entertainment , same joy everytime you listen it . great score somehow brings us 7 years ago , where " mask ... " let us . same themes back new touch maestro , unforgettable . his name horner . james , horner . thank you	1
without doubt , this color me badd top album . songs here so powerful moving , whether it make you get up dance or just sit ponder life general . i never listened cd made me think so many different aspects my life before . quot ; close heavenquot ; quot ; how deepquot ; beautiful songs . i wish i find girl makes me feel words those songs . quot;rosanna little sisterquot ; good beat brings up typical scenario guys - quot ; what you when girl you dating hot younger sister you attracted greatly also likes you too ? quot ; quot ; choosequot ; quot ; time chancequot ; round out best songs . other songs good also , just not , my opinion , same quality five i mentioned . definite buy	1

forget past , let move ' good ' because there so much more than just one song these guys . now granted i love " good " album deluxe friction , baby , but band evovled their sound . any fan long standing band , you must adjust direction they going , all while enjoying their older , more popular , stuff . anyway , review . " burned " starts off nice sing-a-long rock/pop song . lyrics aren't too sappy , happy love song , which good , b/c you won't mind singing it . if managed right , this song would huge hit , very catchy . kevin dreamy-like voice submerges through " daylight . " softens up pace , but not exactly too slow or quiet song . features multitude percussion w/ some backing vocals . good song listen your significant other moonlit night , even though ironically it called " daylight . " somewhat more stripped down " lifetime " appears this album . it still nice version , but personally i like one closer better . this version , however , released single . " it only natural " little eerie twangy , but still not bad song . still very unique song some good lyrics . " overcome " similar radiohead-esque sound it . notes held longer some synthesized music here there . not bad . " special " brings nice kick extra ' oomph ' during chrorus . reminds me song splender called " special " so i don't know if influence . still great song . " american dream " great catchy pop song . it funny how bte keeps putting out these hits hardly anyone here . one best songs ever bte comes " our last night . " lyrics unbelievable meaningful . music outstanding , kevin voice spot . this sort like " stars " combined " lifetime . " quirky story teller springs " southern thing " which down dirty song new orleans , which even made it even more meaningful after katrina hit . i'm glad there something good still coming out big easy . " juicy " might sound familar those desperate houswives commercials . only metronomic guitar kevin high pitched voclals compliments this mix funk disco beats which main focus . if you liked " misunderstood " closer , than you'll like " hollow " which little bit faster . " our finest year " provides great lyrics slower more relaxed ballad type sound . more down earth song " breathless " which ends album nicely . rather shorter finishing number , but not distracting album whole anyway . before robots music not fame . better than ezra already here gone , so this more or less album made fans . i'd say it combination how your garden grow closer . it features some nice dreamy songs some upbeat catchy pop/rock songs . w/ occasional quirkiness band so good .	1

" joy world " eugene ormandy philadelphia orchestra chorus providing rich selection christmas songs , both classical traditional , arranged arthur harris . it former most impressive , although there fewer them , starting mendelssohn " hark ! herald angels sing " tchaikovsky " waltz flowers " " nutcracker , " then ending bach " jesu , joy man desire , " " pastoral symphony " " hallelujan chorus " handel " messiah . " eugene ormandy ( born jen� blau budapest ) one most famous popular american conductors 20th century , known best his long time relationship philadelphia orchestra . originally gaining public notice orchestra when he served last-minute replacement ill arturo toscanini 1931 , ormandy would serve musical director phialdelphia 1938 until 1980 . under his baton philadelphia orchestra became known its warm tones , textured romantic " philadelphia sound , " which well represented this christmas album . i always thought ormandy interpretation rachmaninoff particularly strong , although i not know enough classical music articulate coherent defense position beyond noting when vladimir horowitz played rachmaninoff third concerto occasion 50th anniversary his carnegie hall debut , he picked ormandy conductor orchestra nigh t.t here over hour worth music here you enjoy if you like more classical approach your christmas music . but ormandy work always marked ability bring out emotions music played symphonic orchestra . why standout tracks here " little drummer boy , " " i wonder i wander , " " what child this ?

marion band matured each album while most people recall pop forever young amp ; big japan ( although hardly enough actually make them household name stateside ) this album more mature sophisticated electronic sound . always , gold vocals otherworldly few match his sound range ( accept morten harket a-ha ) music truly elevates his voice . quot ; foolsquot ; quot ; impossible dreamquot ; stand out singles , but quot ; iron johnquot ; so infectious easily greatest alphaville song ever . reggae-tinged quot ; faithquot ; sounds like opening track fun summer blockbuster movie guaranteed get you going morning . title seems so far removed music , perhaps many people can't figure it out , but this album fantastic	1

fledgling uk electropop band hot chip found greater success their second album , " warning , " but thankfully not sold their souls so . this sophomore album simply exploding experiments ideas , so much so otherwise amazing album gets little drippy around edges . give them few more years , hot chip blowing our minds bravest , wildest electronica . moment , they're still trying their wings . it opens retro drones " careful , " right before song suddenly settles into more expansive little groove . it sounds torn retro synth artier edges they so , so good . they stabilize their sound somewhat " i boy school , " its steady beats catchy little melody . there , hot chip experiments just any sound electropop include -- airy little ballads , hip-hoppish dance music , delicate beats like something telepopmusik , grimy robot rock , twinkly little art tunes , some kraftwerk-inspired techno . other words , they twist those amazing art beats into ... anything , really . not many bands every kind music more or less successful results , but hot chip pretty good all kinds music . only problem they seem bit torn popular retro sound , more ou t-t here art sounds . songs like " careful , " it feels awkward unbalanced . but once they work kinks out , hot chip probably few musical flaws all . they knack putting right beats right places , excel deceptively simple melodies never stop catchy -- even quieter ones draw you make you mumble words . they also know just how much pack into single song : beats heavy rough , or delicate crystalline . glimmering synths , spurts bass , funky melodies , buzzes , horns , sonic squiggling , other sounds spice up music . plenty artier moments , without losing catchy dancey beat . alexis taylor sounds bit like benjamin gibbard , his mellow vocals somewhat downbeat attitude . first he seems almost nebulous his own album , but he stands out more more you listen him murmur balloons , colours , " look after me i look after you/that something we both forgot .... " since they nominated mercury award , expect hot chip more prominent than before , hopefully they'll plenty time get even better than they already	1

i fan tim o'brien since his days hot rize . this duet album like-minded multi-instrumentalist darrell scott only reaffirms my opinion o'brien one greatest folk artists performing today . while scott may not household name ( he appeared both o'brien two solo howdy skies outtings : 1999 " crossing " 2001 " two journeys " ) , he complements o'brien nicely playing mandolin , banjo guitar . o'brien plays mandola , mandolin , guitar , bouzouki banjo . two share lead vocals hank williams tune " weary blues waiting " ; otherwise , they alternate lead harmony vocals , including lovely acapella reading hank williams ' " house gold . " rest album consists o'brien scott originals , two traditional tunes ( " little sadie " " keep your lamp trimmed burning " ) . album closes playful " second mouse " including kazoo , toy trombone , slide whistle , harmonica toy guitar accompaniment--it hoot ! album title explained liner notes : " we sat across each other played these songs real time darrell living room .

first , let me point out oasis my favorite band . there isn't oasis song i don't like . so i'm going guide you throughout entire album give you my overall opinion album . masterplan collection oasis b-sides singles covering their first three albums ( definitely maybe , ( what story ) morning glory , here now ) . featured tracks track listing decided online poll oasis fans 1998 . first up : " acquiesce " this probably most famous oasis b-side out there often played live . this song fantastic , combined vocal solos both liam noel gallagher make this song magnificent . noel solo seems sound better than liam , but nevertheless beautiful song . track two : " underneath sky " liam gallagher sings . it sounds good , not strong " acquiesce " but upbeat nice tune . track three : " talk tonight " noel beautiful guitar based song . this something you would hear street performer sing , lyrics sad , but tune relaxing . great song . track four : " going nowhere " noel sings once again , song sad one , but there mix brass string lighten it up . nice soft listen . track five : " fade away " after first few chords you know this definitely maybe era . hard , pure rock oasis good amount " shoegazer " influence . never fails slam good dose energy into me . track six : " swamp song " if you liked untitled filler tracks morning glory wanted whole song , that exactly what " swamp song " . it originally warm up song recording sessions , you tell why . nice hard guitar even mix harmonica it all . fantastic little tune . track seven : " listen up " my personal favorite song album . it plays hard but feels soft . bittersweet beautiful . noel voice shines lyrics flow magnificently . this song should single instead b-side . hidden gem . track eight : " i am walrus ( live ) " first all , this song not played live . it recorded during soundcheck audience noises later added . nevertheless entertaining song , faster paced harder rocking song than original . seems get repetitive end though , but might why oasis sometimes played this song last concerts their early days . track nine : " rockin ' chair " supposedly written noel gallagher back 1990 , this song makes interesting b-side . nice acoustic guitar solos organ mixes well . very well written song it one noel firsts . track ten : " half world away " great song bittersweet one . noel sings very well , while electic guitar organ mix softly nicely . track eleven : " ( it good ) free " hard rocker sounds like " shoegazer " rock opposed britpop . lyrics could use bit support , but i nevertheless enjoy it . there bit nice organ sounds like electric guitar . track twelve : " stay young " famous b-side , featured film " faculty " . lyrics sound like teen revolution , " stay young invincible " , but melody upbeat happy . nice song . track thirteen : " headshrinker " my second favorite song album . sounds like rock overcooked crisp . this hard pure oasis gets . fantastic song . track fourteen : " masterplan " track album named after makes nice finish album . strings brass mixed well bittersweet smooth song . don't miss guitar solo ( reversed recording solo ) . leaves you great aftertaste entire album . now , songs should here but didn't make cut . sadly , my favorite oasis b-side ( quite popular one well ) , " sad song " , missing . fact , they should added all definitely maybe-era b-sides , because they far best . " alive " , " take me away " , " d'yer wanna spaceman " , " cloudburst " some best oasis b-sides but sadly arent masterplan . instead there more focus morning glory-era b-sides . " angel child " b-side here now-era i very much enjoy but just wasn't there . overall , this great album . i highly reccomend it anybody who just loves music . album one my favorites because it encompasses sound oasis through three different albums most songs beautifully bittersweet . i also enjoyed hearing noel voice often , which nice considering liam sings most singles . time writing there supposedly plans sequel " masterplan " covering oasis b-sides their next three albums , it interesting see what makes grade . this indeed fantastic collection oasis b-sides .	1

three composers worked this album , one which infamous nobuo uematsu , it still turned out pretty flat . i feel ashamed say , too , because i've such fan final fantasy music , but there just wasn't whole lot this soundtrack . few songs stood out me , but i really stretch my taste accept them . nothing here bad , though . it just ... not epic , not revolutionary . doesn't make you cry or want sing . it just there . good background music , but you always find plenty . -- one composers , kumi tanioka , entire crystal chronicles soundtrack herself . actually turned out really good , much better than this collection mediocrity	-1
waller armstrong same generation collaborators music 1920s . louis first big leap popular stardom beyond tight group jazz musicians performers came when he introduced " ain't mis behavin '" broadway stage . audiences often forced him three or four encores . folks who seen show before would pay full price just get hear louis sing this one song . recordings late 20s louis all vocals simply my idea best music ever recorded anyone . rather than get them selected this way , you might want get one cds or collections covers period time everything , rather than just songs waller . likewise , while all stars not good his original chicago new york groups , particularly these later all-stars ( i prefer albums great jack teagarden ) , if you get into music you want all too . any rate , there no one else but louis who these songs justice except fat man himself , mr. waller	1

finally , i bought this soundtrack several days ago . but i little disappointed because it not so good my anticipation . when i watched this movie , song " jungle rhythm " my favourite . but when i listened this song soundtrack , i felt it little noisy confuse . lead vocals not so clear . i don't like song " colonel hathi march " all this album , fact , i didn't like this song beginning when i watched movie " jungle book " . my favourite song this album not movie , it " i've got you beat " . i love two children vocal this song , i thought this song real jungle rhythm ! " right where i belong " " braver " wonderful , i loved girl vocal , i felt warm inside when i listened these two songs . there 3 humorous songs which i loved very much , " he lucky , lucky snake " " elephant face " " never smile crocodile " , they always make me laugh ! " w-i-l-d " " queen jungle " wonderful too . generally speaking , except song " i wanna like you " " bare necessities " which sung different ways , every song this album worth listening	1
this album listened multiple times not tire it . instrumental work accompanies dolly wonderful vocals impecable . song mountain angel , despite one reviewer comments quite touching haunting . it story innocent woman who taken advantage jilted thoughtless man . crying harmonies reflect woman mournful cries give you goosebumps . balance such heavy subject material , " i get kick out you " light song sparkles like champagne bubbles . music just flows through you . it well worth getting this one .	1

" i would never learned whippits it not leary . thanks his soliloquy meat , i didn't eat salad until three years ago . even though he best known drugs smoking , i think best part album when he went his musical diatribe : explain it me . heavy metal bands trial because kids commit suicide ? what ? judas priest trial because " my kid bought record , listened lyrics ..... " well that great ! sets legal precedent . mean i sue dan folgerberg making me into ( expletive deleted ) mid-70 . possible , huh ? huh ?!

balancing motherhood her career tough but she mange pull it off this album . i think she great job her part but her promoters slacking there . if she ever chooses album she should consider hiring new crew . i always loved toni music this album reminds me why . i bit disappointed `more than woman ' but `libra ' puts her back where she belongs . lead off single " please " fantastic . it sets album off good way delivers her back into game rather nicely . second single " trippin ( thats way love works ) " also strong . next song " whats good " smooth enjoyable . song " take this ring " it very evident amerie producer wrote this song but holds out very well adds diversity this album . songs " midnite " " i wanna ( your baby ) " really good because it showcases her signature voice beautifully .

eagle glenn frey first solo album came out may , 1982 , it dated little bit , like almost all mainstream rock records 80s . but much " no fun aloud " holds up very well , frey jack tempchin songwriting partnership produced handful really good pop-rock song distinct soul flavour . album produced no fewer than five singles , soaring soul ballad " one you love " peaking #15 billboard 200 ( #2 adult contemporary listings ) . " partytown " got #5 mainsteam rock list , it pretty good little rocker ... it always sounded better live , though . opener " i found somebody " highlight , great mid-tempo soul-rock tune al garth sax . frey goes further into soul territory gentle " i volunteer " swaggering " i've born again " , lays down pretty good rendition huey ' piano ' smith " sea cruise " . latter half album not quite consistent first . synthetic " don't give up " dated really badly , " all those lies " just not particularly memorable . ballad " girl " , co-written fellow detroit native bob seger , perhaps bit too sweet some , but spanish-sounding " she can't let go " real gem . frey plays some lovely acoustic guitar bass parts , his voice perfect instrument this type song . glenn frey liner notes clever very much worthwhile , way , his impeccable vocals knack crafting laid-back love songs take this album long way . 3 1/2 stars . enjoyable forty minutes	1

browsing through cds local store other day , i came upon " way vaselines : complete anthology " ( 1992 ) . name familiar , if not music . i heard vaselines , like lot people , because course nirvana covered few their songs " incesticide " ( 1992 ) " mtv unplugged " ( 1994 ) albums . because ( 1 ) kurt cobain loved band mentioned them numerous times various interviews , ( 2 ) vaselines something indie-pop/rock icons , i decided check their album out . i instantly captivated just one listen " way vaselines : complete anthology . " it truly great cd underappreciated band both instantly addictive remains enjoyable intriguing repeated listens . clocking slightly less than hour , there surprising amount diversity found this single disc which encompasses band entire body work . while vaselines sometimes pigeonholed " indie-pop , " their songs range punk 60s-esque acoustic/folk , " indie-pop . " times it sounds though band strong donovan influence , but then album take 180 degree turn show its punk teeth . there even little new-wave thrown mix off-beat " you think you're man . " contrasting male/female vocal interplay singers/founders eugene kelly frances mckee works very nicely not unlike style , b-52s , more recently lacuna coil . listening this cd , it easy see where kurt cobain , mudhoney , iron wine , no doubt others found inspiration . while vaselines lasted only few years ( 1986-1990 ) produced very small body work , their talent influence shouldn't devalued .	1
if i give " where they now " award , group home would probably receive it . group home debut cd " livin ' proof " rememerable cd back late 1995 . i first heard these guys gang starr " hard earn " lp . what grabbed my attention get this lp everybody said this some dj premier best production . heck , it blessing couple tracks produced primer , let alone entire album . i say this best production i heard comming east coast good minute . if you heard beats " serious rap sh ... " " up against wall " ( thats just some songs here awesome production ) . it seemed like premo just held back his production gang starr jeru , gave them group home . lot people wondered if he gave those same beats artists like nas or jeru damaja what would results would . hell , if he gave beats wackest rapper out right now , it would almost sound like second comming illmatic or such . they're good . group home ( melachi nutcracker lil ' dap ) , they don't bad job holding down rhymes . fact only inferior this album . i've heard better rhymes , but i've also heard way worse . especially all music comming out today , they make this duo sound like lyrical masters . " suspended time " would good song lyrical standpoint . excellent song " 2 thousand " ( hence my review title ) some good rhymes . guru big shug comes song " serious rap sh .. " , well jack ripper smiley ghetto child rhyme song " realness " . jeru damaja talks end one tracks well . so this album excellent fans gang starr primo production . this album some best beats he made his career . although lil ' dap melachi rhyme skills aren't great , they don't make this cd waste . if possible , search instrumentals this lp , because you'll glad you . but this album also keeper . they followed up album 1999 , i check out well . lyrics : c+production : a+guest appearances : a-musical vibes : a-overall : b+favorite tracks : livin ' proof , serious rap sh .., suspended time , sacrifice , up against wall ( both mixes ) , 2 thousand , supa star , realnesspeace everyone !!	1
so many ways , this album oasis destined make . they cocky , over-the-top , excessive group before , but " here now " they really cranked up noise bravado . just look length songs . " my big mouth " ( my personal favorite track ) seems like simple ditty compared colossal songs make up remainder album . " all around world " clocks modest 9 minutes , then reprises end disc . " d'ya know what i mean " begins album bombastic roar never really relents . yet , this exactly road oasis headed very beginning . they always biggest , best point excess . this album culmination lifestyle they enjoying up til ' 97 . that exactly what makes this album so great . it carefree yet bombastic . it fun but overwhelming . it both frustrating engaging . there no other oasis album like it , better or worse . all criticisms mean nothing when you hear song wonderful " stand me " or " magic pie . " oasis nothing if not entertaining ( something can't said their most recent efforts ) . " here now " both celebration funeral britpop . give it chance . i'm sure you'll like it	1

said , it certainly its charms , especially highly technically accomplished standpoint : no one , i think , able gainsay level pure musical brilliance achieved brad his original trio mates , larry grenadier ( bass ) jorge rossy ( drums ) , regularly made manifest this , many ways , remarkable disc . unfortunately , despite its mastery arcane mysteries high-level improvisational music-making , there seems something lacking . soulfulness , perhaps ? yes , music , all its technical brilliance , seems little bloodless , sort like , maybe , brad mfa dissertation summarizing history jazz . this strikes me one those discs our most gifted jazz musicians occasionally get out their systems--it certainly very challenging music probably loads fun play , but it leaves even informed listener scratching his head disconcertedly , hoped more friendly music handed musical snake -- albeit , strikingly beautiful -- when what he wished , simply , bread . certainly worth acquiring , but more admirably than listenable . piano trio jazz absolutely not disappoint , check out frank kimbrough latest , play	1

smooth , sultry sharp three " s " describe mr. alexander o'neal . way before keith sweat , brian mcknight . kelly , alexander o'neal romantic crooner his time . smooth , though forceful approach , mr. o'neal voice make me drop everything take notice , his voice captivating . help musical geniuses ( two sickingly great men who turn anything into hit ) jimmy jam terry lewis , alexander o'neal crafted this musical masterpiece back 1986 . " hearsay " journey it self , slick funk grooves heart sleeve balladry , album follows alex through joys pain love . start " hearsay " party sounds voices , much likings marvin gaye tunes . it starts off album " this album going blow your mind " type vibe . it builds you into what come next . something " what i ( make you love me ) " . three words : funky , funky , funky ! " lovers " ultimate expressway crusing song . i pledged myself when i get my first car , i'm going pop this when i graze my city skyline . thundering keyboards , forceful syncopated vocals tight drum beats make you feel love , real . soulful empowering title track , alex shows his impressive vocal range . biggest hit off here , " fake " snarky , snappy down right funky tune girl who well ... fake ! hilarious lyrics jamming keyboards make you understand why this song such huge hit . next hit , " critize " features some funny dialouge beautiful backing vocals lisa keith . i like how alex her trade off vocals , nicely . this song pulsating piece pre-new jack heaven . my girl , cherrelle ( i love this woman , when i listen her i wonder how hell she not become bigger success ! ) shows up " never knew love like this " . i always enjoy when alex cherrelle duet cause they always sound so passionate . soulful gospel-esqe tune awaits your ears ! " sunshine " nothing but gorgeous it beautiful yet dark ballad . it mesmerizes you start alex really belting it out . " crying overtime " sounds like precursor some stuff boyz ii men would later 90 , it really sounds like " bended knee " ( which jam lewis wrote ) . it lush , heart sleeve tune once again alex it justice his voice . " when party over " cool sultry perfect way end this fantastic album . it truly shame this album mostly negelected much alexander himself . i just don't understand how alexander cherrelle shut out music business ! jimmy jam terry lewis their best work them i understand there such thing " janet jackson factor " . i'm fan janet too , but since i've dug deeper jam lewis catalog un-earthed cherrelle alex , i've come believe only reason why janet became such star because well ... michael little sister . not her music wasn't good ( her music good , no doubt-she talent ) but if you pair her stuff cherrelle alexander it pales comparison . i usually tend push " control " aside make way " hearsay " cherrelle " affair " . i'm truthful . after " hearsay " , alexander never achieved much star power even though he guest star cherrelle 1988 masterpiece " affair " . i never understand why ? maybe he overshadowed luther vandross , who really began become huge his hit " here now " ? or maybe people moving into more hip-hop state mind this time ? i no idea why alexander o'neal became music casuality . i know he still performs released some albums after this but he now resides england performs mostly there . how i wish he would come back show some these young rb crooners how really sing ! get " hearsay " hear singer get caught up funky jamming sounds jam lewis , especially since it digitally remastered all it glory . you not dissapointed!jen top 51 . critizie2 . lovers3 . fake4 . sunshine5 . never knew love like thi	1

kapke74 10/03 review here hit it head : syl " there riot goin ' " indeed relaxing , hypnotic , totally narcotic quality it . heavy bass , slowed down drugged out jams ... tempos melodies ... it like drugs without taking them yourself . musical freestylin ' indulgence ... just jammin ' man ... note sound . import version indeed very good sound quality it . it may not " 20-bit superaudio remaster , " but one might attribute it something much simpler : perhaps it just better master tape . my cd copy made germany we all knew uk/euro/japan versions vinyl pressings always clearly superior us version , so why not cd product ? but back review ... hits here course " family affair , " " ( you caught me ) smilin '" " runnin ' away " ... pretty autobiographical stuff if you know syl story read ( snort ) lines . sorry i just write . still genius prevails . sly family stone first foray into dark side ' 70s ... post-summer love/end-of-the-'60s hangover thang . dig it	1

i just introduced myself captain buying this album spotlightkid/clear spot . i must say this now one my favorite albums all time ! this probably craziest album you'll ever hear but thats good thing . why ? because it never gets old theres enough zany personality dynamics fill 10 cds . every time i notice something new ! pure original ! captain beefheart rock what arnold shoenburgh " classical " music or what ornette coleman jazz . now one things might make this cd confusing 1st there some very serious tracks some very humurous/tounge cheek tracks all same place . but either way madness name game . all songs belong together its just sometimes beefheart observing madness world ( " dachau blues " ) sometimes hes acting it out ( " old fart play " ) . some tracks fall these 2 extremes ( " hobo chang ba " ) all cases its very cathartic me so i love it	1
i thought 4 cds pet sounds its outtakes would too much . i mean , i agree pet sounds colossal album , triumph all times , but 4 cds ? yes . it worth it . if you're big fan album itself , you'll enjoy hearing it dissected , hearing all different parts how they put together . then ... you listen stereo mix final album ( not released time ) you realize hype warranted . pet sounds good .	1

i am huge type o fan . i seen them over 20 times driven hundreds miles so . my wife i waiting this album subsequent tour years . we tickets see them philly last time but thats when peter his drug incident tour canceled . anyhoo , so i pre order album wait baited breath . when it finally arrives , i am almost instantly disappointed . i played bands throughout years i know when jamming group sometimes you try get something going it just isn't working . usually you stop playing move something else . most these songs fall into this category . unfortunately us , type o went ahead finished , recorded , released them . peter usually well crafted lyrics replaced words 6th grader could written . " she burns me down , down , down ground " . what heck ? one reviewer wrote , there only two songs note . one , september sun , ok . this mainly because its rehash their greatest song " love you death " . this song even suffers same silly lyrics repeated ad nauseum last minute or so song . i don't even remember name other song i somewhat liked , but it doesn't matter anyway . all those reviewers rave this album , whats wrong you ? wait , i bet you all liked metallica st. anger too ... any true type o fan , this album grave disappointment . my wife i we're psyched go see them sonar baltimore , but after this album came out , we'll just watch their " symphony devil " dvd loud volume instead . bottom line , don't bother this .	-1

survivor first new release 17 years sees return jimi jamison vocals , joined original members frankie sulivan ( who also produced)on guitars marc droubay drums . album great melodic rock release . best tracks include rocker " fire makes steel " ( which rumored make appearance new rocky movie ) , moody " gimme word , " power ballad " one more chance . " frankie sullivan sings two songs , catchy " talkin ' bout love , which sounds like rembrandt theme tv show " friends " he also sings terrible " nevertheless , " which track three kills momentum album . biggest criticism album too many ballads , but survivor achieved most their success thanks mid-tempo songs found " reach . " unfortunately , album dead water because jamison again left group citing creative differences sullivan , who recruited robin mcauley new vocalist . so fans waited 17 years get new album , then they don't get chance see band live performing new songs ! buy album , it their last classic release .	1
it ruth brown excellent autobiography quot ; miss rhythmquot ; intrigued me pick this compilation . first it obvious collection singles would eventually wound up sounding bit same - succesful quot ; singlesquot ; formula its bit thin when it streches over 21 songs ( difference carefully selected choice lp which usualy varies tempo ) all this great uptempo songs sounds alike . surprisingly enough , i found myself coming back this cd quitte often now i found interesting variety here - brown first single , melancholy ballad quot ; so longquot ; , exciting quot ; mama , he treats your daughter meanquot ; ( clearly inspiration little richard quot ; lucillequot ;) gospel quot ; i see everybody babyquot ; my favourite track , sexy quot ; i dont knowquot ; ( strange enough she commercial twilight time recording ! ) brown passionate involved all way through . althought i still prefer her later-days albums - older brown excatly bad blues mama her father afraid she would became one day - this very good compilation . guess what , after all my intial reservations , i am actually buying her double-cd rhino anthology quot ; miss rhythm morequot ; which bigger selection better variety tempos ( quot ; sentimental journeyquot ; quot ; ol ' man riverquot ;)	1
i guess it " like ' em " or " hate ' em " westlife . problem i love most euro boybands . their freshman album even 1 or 2 strong tracks but this collection weak . it no hooks ! nothing sticks my head . i guess they're going through motions song writing tossing few poorly produced covers . westlife may forever scarred whipped cream mouth sessions offered auditions day ronan keating . it no wonder why close no one usa heard them . my advice ' team ' before any these songs even got pre-production phase would , lose those industry knee pads you all wear think yourselves	-1

when it comes miles " second great quintet , " much made " miles smiles " " nefertiti " classic albums , but i heard next nothing this one . however , when i bought " e.s.p. " it blew my mind , i picked this one up all other albums this group : wayne shorter saxophone , herbie hancock piano , ron carter bass , tony williams drums . this album may not receive much attention others period , but it deserves just much praise undisputed classics . i think there certain things this album better than " miles smiles " " nefertiti ; " when rhythm section playing straight time , they never sounded more pocket or swung harder than here . then within confines few seconds they break out their perfect groove just explode , again , it more effective here than any other albums . central this aspect music tony williams gives what probably best performance his tenure miles . man monster drummer displays major drum chops but also excellent taste amazing knack shaping what rest band doing . part reason williams contributions their very best material plays his personal strengths . tunes themselves may not best compositions this band discography but they vehicles some killer playing . " stuff " band first obvious foray into what would become fusion ; hancock plays fender rhodes carter plays electric bass ( against his ) , williams pushes band his still unmatched jazz-rock feel . then " paraphernalia " features george benson guitar , but not some kind special guest feature gimmick common music industry today . benson there because his guitar adds texture intriguing groove , times almost sounding like something out " west side story " but explosive release which lifts band individual soloists new heights . williams absolutely brilliant his support energy , it often interesting listen his " background " it listen soloists . williams composition " black comedy " fantastic feature this same role ; he makes drums into voice equal partnership musical ideas . then " country son " features truly inspired playing everyone . file this album under difficult understand appreciate . it took me seven years heavy exposure jazz before i could really appreciate or even like this band . it not good place introduced miles though it rock influenced some tunes it doesn't make good crossover . but if you want get into some fantastic , creative , energetic music , try following this band recorded lineage , starting " e.s.p. " which most accessible band music , it first . once you appreciate creative depth this band explorations , it make this album all more enjoyable amazing	1

randy newman portrait southern united states represents peak his career culmination four albums . begged beaten into music industry friends colleagues ( one them supposedly john lennon , who called newman say all beatles heard his demos ) , newman fourth album original material provides evidence those friends colleagues provided us great service . " good old boys " stands one newman greatest acheivements , arguably one greatest albums 1970s . rolling stone even proclaimed it 393rd best album all time 2003 ( though it probably deserves put much higher ) . furtive glance album title , accompanying peek song titles ( " rednecks " , " birmingham " , naked man " , " guilty " ) would suggest slam dunk satirical no holds barred slash south . not so . newman approaches subject dignity balance not often bequeathed united states ' southern states . not say " good old boys " eulogizes south ( this no " gone wind " ) . bad ugly also creep : racism , prejudice , drunkedness , poverty , populism , obscenity . newman , himself southerner birth , forayed into this territory before . 1970 " 12 songs " included " old kentucky home " " yellow man " , though former contained more nudge nudge satire than " good old boys " . this album expands themes explored those songs expands it into length entire album . results come out more context than they song-by-song basis . example , " birmingham " " marie " , both amazing songs , take different tone when following " rednecks " . " rollin '" represents sigh denial after long arduous inhale . song feels different isolation than it end song cycle " good old boys " . this entails tightly composed well thought out collection amazing songs . they all stand their own but nonetheless take different life context album . " rednecks " newman most shocking song more reasons than its abrasive lyrics . somehow it manages sympathetic , vindictive , satirical , racist , anti-racist sentiments all once . it puts ' redneck ' stereotype under microscope proclaims issues more complex than they seem . it revels southern stereotypes while pointing finger northward justifiably famous lines northern ' cages ' where blacks kept " free " states . indirectly it says " least we're honest it down here " . it all this without promoting stereotypes or racism . this incomprehensible dichotomy pervades entire album . especially newman portrait huey long " every man king " which leads into " kingfish " . newman takes orchestral lessons arrangements learned his previous albums puts them incredible work here . strings , horns , steel guitar , newman distinctive piano all fall together here perfect balance . completely gone instrumental excesses self-conscious arrangements his first two albums ( i.e. , he overused orchestra his first album abandoned it his second ) . " louisiana 1927 " contains one most beautifully orchestrated choruses all pop music , stands one newman best . amazing strings " kingfish " " rollin '" also deserve mention , though all songs notable . 2cd set includes demo " good old boys " called " johnny cutler birthday " . this reveals album origins concept album revolving around one person . this focus proved too narrow subject matter , least six songs demo not make final album . one them revolves around extreme profanity . others fill story line ( narrated newman his solo piano voice takes ) . all top notch newman leave listeners wondering what else lurks newman vault . " good old boys " stands one one newman most impressive achievements . every randy newman fan needs this cd set . both original album demo remain firm solid concrete hard ground some thirty years later	1
i'm coming out closet finally putting myself record saying this paul simon best album solo artist . i also agree other reviewers -- this one fifty best albums twentieth century . although graceland landmark record , there many " outside " issues record . troubles cultural snobbery exploitation ( particularly los lobos ) , unsituated appropriation " third world " musics musicalisms , just plain screwed up " liberal " new york elitism . some still here this album -- even caetano veloso took some pot shots paul simon , carlinhos brown . but great art judged time much anything else , i believe this fascinating moving record , whose subtle shifting rhythms , melodies , harmonies , chords represent perhaps best admixture brazilian , african , american sensibilities history pop music ( jazz music here , course , excepted ; music beyond this discussion entirely separate category ) . single biggest thing sticks out me this album percussion work . you get broad deep emotional working out variety african-matrixed south american percussion styles , perhaps biggest musical achievement simon here his sly sophisticated incorporation stunning variety polyrythms into his already legendary folk folksy pop music . this music times simply gorgeous -- it flows like river , occasion it flows thick lovingly like hot lava . this grown-up , laid back , ( best american/brazilian collaborative tradition ) , intelligent , lovely , wise music . highly recommended .	1
this cd my introduction donnie mcclurkin sometime ago remains my favorite . it passionate inspiring . donnie voice angel words these songs minister spirit .	1
i am thoroughly satisfied this cd -- it everything i both wanted expected . its premise simple : get all theme songs james bond films one disc . this quote-unquote official release , so it neglects " never say never again , " unofficial odd-jobs associated 007 . although it released 2002 , some reason it lacks razzie-winning " die day , " which released year . since it released 2002 , don't expect find " you know my name " " casino royale . " this collection definitely gets five stars including " we all time world . " since this lazenby solo , we seldom hear it ; yet it one best songs come out franchise . like i said , this cd everything i expected , down liner notes . i only two criticisms . first , songs not chronological , so we miss evolution early brassy rat pack themes toned-down anthems epitomized " your eyes only " then techno/hip-hop lite later films . arraigned way they , you get better overall presentation . either way you arrange tracks , you always shuffle . second more criticism franchise opposed cd ( i mentioned how well i liked product ? ) . included two remixes james bond dr. no theme -- moby parodi/fair . now remix definition just same music underlaying drum machine , it solely played dance clubs those annoying subwoofers wheels -- nothing more . i think this keep up gala spirit film , also revamp franchise younger audiences problem there nothing wrong franchise -- six year hiatus due legal quagmire geopolitical shake up associated end cold war . so doing remixes like these really not contribute bond experience . personally , i thought they both condescending obvious . ( then again , where else would you put them ? )so other than these two critiques , i happily recommend this disc bond fan , pleasant memories this music bring	1
