i bought this product sephora . i it two weeks used it only 2 times . when i tried use it after , little red light wouldn't come it just wouldn't work . i took it back sephora exchange since i still within 30 day exchange period . second one worked two months ... then same thing happened . i only using it maybe once or twice week , most . this product horrible . i never dropped it or anything like . fact , soon it would cool down after using , i would place it back box it came . i am actually process returning it manufacturer . honestly , i wanted good flat iron i thought this good product because it expensive ... big mistake . my friend bought straight iron $100 she it almost year . she also straightens her hair lot more often than i . i don't know why i didn't ask her where she got hers . please read all reviews before you make this purchase . if you don't believe me , wait see if someone you know buys it so you find out first hand how bad this product .	-1
i not like this shampoo all . fairness , i give it two stars because it may not good coarse african american hair . it seemed make my hair clump together made it difficult comb through when wet . one thing detangle it however ojon hydrating conditioner which i love . pleasant scent foamed up well	-1
i'm sorry but this one worst perfumes . i seriously spray myself 10 times within 30 minutes you can't smell thing . yes scent great , i love it . but only person who opportunity smell it me . really really disapointed . i guess i'm just used channel ralph lauren lines . they quality last most day . this stuff plan old junk like most new stuff coming out these days .	-1
philosophy states their cosmetic containers : there no such thing unblemished skin . well , this sure true , when you use this kit kit . i pictures proove , more than month using acne kit kit not even one acne spot dissapeared . i'm combining it oxygen peel- this doesn't help either . i happy young horse all this products around $40 : night day cream , facial wash blemish serum . all they ( maybe except wash ) drying out skin . soon i buy super-moisturizing revitalizing night cream sensitive skin , high spf day cream ( my skin started showing dark , sun-exposure spots , altough i using spf filter ) finally no acne or gone . i dont get it- i better results using $0 , 97 hydrogen peroxide after toner than this hydrogen peroxide- based line cosmetics . same price i could bought stuff really works-the one vanessa williams happy . i know cause i tried it , didn't make my skin feel like sahara my next choice . save your money . p.s. oxygen peel o.k. dough	-1
i'm very disappointed results . i am fairly young , 31 . i very fine lines i thought this would make them disappear . it really didn't anything my skin . plus it greasy unpleasant smell . i not recommend this	-1
if you order this kit , make sure you time practice it ! it takes several practice applications get shade just right . while it cover completely , it not flawless . you tell you've covered something up your skin . if it not big deal , you might just want leave your tattoo visible instead big discolored spot or someone who really good colors makeup cover it you this kit	-1
i bought this shortly after i started using it sides my noise started swelling up peeling . i didn't know what going i stopped using it it immediately went away .. soon i started wearing it again swelling pain came back . i am person who doesn't break out very often i tolerate many products . i now permanent red mark right side my nose it hasn't faded yet . i tried take it back nordstrom they wouldn't exchange i t.t his product sucks it only one i using i know thats what caused swelling .	-1
eyeshadow isn't bad , nice color , but packaging disappointment . brush sits down center encased loose powder you can't get very much onto brush . there no way open casing either , so its pretty useless . i found powder odd texture loose eyeshadow also .	-1
never i so unhappy my makeup i when i using clinique . i used stay beige ( which i lightly patted my face top clinique superfit liquid makeup - i oily skin told this would help reduce shine ) end result it just made me look ghostly . i also hated how clinique liquid foundation powder didn't matching shades , so i settle honey liquid beige powder . much i went back macy try convince them these weren't my shades , they just wouldn't listen . either they didn't time or patience help me pick new shade , or they convinced i making big deal out nothing . instead sitting there arguing them ( which i shouldn't first place ) i just switched different makeup line : laura mercier , which i am very happy . i've many other friends who unhappy clinique switched over different makeup brand , well . i'm not trying knock product . i'm just saying it wasn't me or many other people i know . i would definitely not recommend clinique anyone . i'd rather pay little more get better results rather than settle $20 product just because it affordable .	-1

i used this product evening noticed immediate plumping . i also use lipfusion xl ( 50.00 )- but sometimes results not long-lasting . when i used too-faced lip injection mask- results immediate , seemed continue hours . when i woke morning- my lips very plumped- much more so than lip fusion alone . i use these products together- lip injection mask too-faced amazing ! used first , then lip fusion xl layered top after rinsing off mask- it seriously looked like i undergone medical-procedure lip-plumping ! i highly reccommend this lip injection mask .	1

i am very glad my purchase . it gives subtle natural glow skin not tacky shiny one . i am usually not very comfortable wearing foundation i prefer tinted moisturizers . happy light gives even complexion without heavy . it also offers sun protection , spf 15 . if you don't need more than medium coverage , it worth considering this brand .	1

... if you don't use this stuff ! after too many years uncomfortable shaves wait 2-3 days shaving let my raw , sore neck recover , i finally started some research into what i could add my regimen/technique improve results . i read numerous articles benefits pre-shave oil , so i decided add this stuff my arsenal ... i'm never going back . first off , price might detrement those who used $3/can drug store shaving cream , but little goes long way , this little bottle might actually last you longer than 4 or 5 cans cream or gel . you only use small amount each day , it spreads evenly over your whole face . when used tandem good shaving cream , it virtually eliminates razor burn uncomfortable shaving . my razor glides over my face each morning now . if you look your razor each morning disgust like i used , give this stuff shot . i guarantee you won't disappointed . try their shaving cream " old school " shaving brush well . pamper your face ... this how shaving supposed before cheap aerosol shaving cream disposable plastic razors started ripping our faces shreds	1
not your typical thick , floral-smelling perfume , this perfume smells exactly like its name advertises -- like lemon juice mixed sugar . it seasonal perfume ( i can't imagine smelling like lemons winter ) . it smells very crisp , fresh , clean , which i enjoy lot , but i imagine others would not ; same things i like this perfume , could smell like cleaning product others . go your fridge . get lemmon , squeeze its juice out into cup add some sugar . if you enjoy smell you get , buy this perfume -- i highly recommend it . if not , stick something more traditional vanilla/floral like ana sui " dolly girl "	1

our local macy recently offered free skin typing samples go it . i really only went pick up free moisturizer i've found some judicious sampling you don't pay item . instead , i fell love this soap ( got free moisturizer too-hooray !! )when sales rep first handed me bar soap , i balked . i've known people who've used clinique but just idea washing my face bar soap freaked me out . they offer liquid version but rep told me soap better exfoliant . i can't say sure if that so but i say this really great face wash . i addicted after one use . since it bar soap , you'll get really great sudsy foam . it mild , pleasant scent it washes off easily . i mild version i just love it . my skin feels clean but never tight not only it not cause breakouts , it immediately calmed one i . i'll definitely buying more . i want add , however , it drying wintertime if you normal skin i switch cream cleanser . it may not problem oily skin . dry skin , i'd really avoid it winter least . you still ideally need makeup remover before soap . i also became recent convert clinique rinse off foaming cleanser . but even if you don't want use product , remember removing your makeup separate step .	1
my first thought crumbling some this into my running bath it reminded me bubble baths when i kid . there this really nice subtle clean smell this bubble bar . i really like it not overpoweringly smelly bubble bar . it great those who don't want flowery bath , but who can't tolerate overwhelming patchouli blue skies bar . i wish i'd bought two these instead one this one blue skies . plus , this good bar mixing bath bomb . really probably any bomb would . good stuff	1
i love fresh scent avobath , there just nothing like it . it smells like springtime me . i yet notice any glitter avobath bath ( i've taken 10 ) so if you're glitter shy , don't let stop you trying this one	1
this first bronzer i actually finished . this gives most natural finish blends really well . i like it matte because i'm not fan sparkly bronzer . ever since i started using this , i'm just addicted can't live without it . it gives skin really natural , healthy-looking flush . i've got medium/olive skin i use " light " . my skin doesn't look orangey or dirty . try it i'm sure you'll like it . make sure you use really good brush .	1
i hooked sebastian shine serum forever . then i switched this after hearing all rave reviews . it makes it just shiny sebastian , but my thick wavy hair , it easier apply . i only need quarter size amount , way less than any other product . it nice soft finish . so if you like sebastian redkin shine serums , you'll like this . i'm not going go far say it miracle worker . it makes your hair shinier . it helps little my frizz , but doesn't depouf .	-1
i use both this mascara lancome flextencils when i'm going out , flextencils first then coat hypnose . my lashes look huge not too clumpy . flextencils add great length , while hypnose adds volume . i use hypnose itself just average day . great product ! makes my lashes big not clump	1

this far best shaving product i ever used . yes , it pricey , but if you get past , you won't disappointed . i hesitated purchase this months b/c price , but my friend gave me sample try -- i hooked ! it decandent creamy , little goes long way . i also used spend more money expensive razors get closer shave ; i now only use cheapie razors my legs so much smoother than before ! i also use this under my arms no irritation ( this hesitation , i very sensative skin ) . fragrance amazing well . sweet , name , but not overpowering . this works very well layering benefit other scented products , or their maybe baby fragrance , they all smell similar enough compliment one .	1
i love smell philosophy pure grace . shampoo/shower gel smells just clean fresh perfume . it not too drying either	1
all i say this product great , because my indian heritage , i got dark circle around my eyes after baby my dark cirlce got worse . i looked so tired older dark cirlces . i bough lot products cover my undereye dark circles , but i not happy all . i keep trying new concealers but no satisfaction all . one day i went store they sell bobbi products , i just looking powder matched my skin tone bobbi brown . they got me right powder color she asked me try out some bobbi brown creamy concealer my dark cirlces . i not sure but i let her try it me . i so happy see my dark circles gone . i keep getting compliments how fresh i look makes me feel pretty . since than its my all time favourite . little goes long way . i think its great people serious dark circles . i got little kit small mirror , included yellow based concealer little darker creamy concealer even out yellow concealer your skin color yellow powder finishing touch . you just get right color concealer your skin complexion . its little expensive small kit but i love it its money worth	1
i know this reviews clarifying lotion 2 but i thought i would let people know new product clarifying moisture lotion 2 . i dry , sensitive skin when assessed girls clinique counter i came out skin type i/ii . i use extra mild facial soap , clarifying moisture lotion 2 dramatically different moisturising lotion . when i looked reviews here amazon i suprised find so many people unhappy product , but i happened go clinique counter other day found australia there two ranges clarifying lotions , original , which what everyone talking , new moisture lotions . according sales assistants new moisture lotion developed asian market alcohol free asian region australia luckily gets both . they exfoliate like regular lotions but there no sting or tingle skin feels really soft . my face feels like polished marble moment my makeup going staying much better than before . i tell you my skin never looked better since starting clinique i would recomend this skin care line anyone .	1
not only this gel smell terrific , like real raspberry sorbet , it functional well . this lathers up nice you don't use lot product . you use it body wash , shampoo conditioner i suppose bubble bath too . so makes it four one . i take this trips because its easy grab put my overnight bag i take less product me . i also use this when i'm running late take quick shower . this also comes many other yummy scents . try them you not disappointed .	1

white linen classic fragrance daytime use . it fresh , crisp scent perfect summer , when heavier scents " turn " this my first " young ladies " scent , remains one my favorites . other white linen items : powder , body lotions soaps wonderful layering this perfume . because it so light , you can't overdo it . its crisp white blue packaging , it makes lovely gift anyone	1
there i waiting shaving my legs water tub draining away when suddenly i looked down noticed all these little glittery confetti hearts . so cute ! nice surprise i didn't see them while i taking bath . i see little candy flowers floating . this bath high " cuteness " factor if you one those " everything pink " moods , then think pink may suit your candy mood . lavender oil , tonka absolute , vanilla neroli oil makes this calming bath leaves you little happier . you may enjoy this bath even more calming sweet " honey i washed kids sweet honey soap " or " sultana soap " bar which sumptuously smooth leaves fragrance your skin lasts all night . if you want pink/vanilla soap , then you may want " rock star . " if you into mixing matching according scents , then trichomania mildly scented coconut looks like vanilla shampoo bar it goes well vanilla scented american cream conditioner . i vote tad more vanilla , although you toss little vanilla oil bath or some vanilla kitchen also works well . eating sugar cookies tub optional . ~ rebecca review	-1
i'm picky my lipstick . not only shade great ( not garish or sparkly ) but i want it smell pleasant ( or not all ) , taste pleasant ( or not all ) i want case feel substantial click when i close it . ok -- so how this one measure up ? shades awsome . i like baby lips natural lips . it smells ok -- kind like vasaline -- but only faintly . estee lauder lipstick much stronger perfume smell lacome tends smell fruity . it tastes faintly like chapstick . case relatively heavy it clicks . neither taste nor smell off-putting but because i'm so picky it only gets 4 stars . ( texture smooth well it doesn't feel heavy your lips . ) if you want natural ( not sparkly ) lips everyday this good choice	-1
i love trying new fragrances , when i came across this yesterday tried it , - i became hooked instantly . it beautiful perfume somewhat floral fruity same time , but isn't too overpowering me , lasted quite while . packaging great . it fresh looking pretty , but it fragrance itself hooked me . i got few comments it right away , so i think i'm going back store buy some . it might little too heavy hot summer days , but perfect winter . i think this definately suit cooler climates better , or if it too hot , it probably become sickly too strong . if you like blend fruit floral , this you . it stunning different . i love it	1
my hairstylist accidentally bleached my hair too much . if wasn't bad enough , end week i noticed my hair visibly dryer lost its shine . i used this " marinating " oil overnight - slept plastic shower cap . i surprised how easily it washed out morning . there no " oily " residue weighing my hair down either . i very impressed results , it put shine body back my hair - i've only used it once , they recommend overnight treatments once week - i'm expecting even better results end month . i'd definetly recommend this product .	1

i've using this product couple years , i can't imagine ever without it . first time i put it , however , i used too much my chanel foundation refused spread - it just sat blotch my face . i took " present " back makeup counter where they told me use amount equal size half pea - my entire face ! i doubtful , but spreading it super-thin worked , plus each bottle lasts long , long time . here my favorite things this product : -foundation glides supersmooth-fine wrinkles less visible-makeup stays put all day long-keeps oily skin shine-free-works great eyeshadow base keep it creasing-makes skin feel softthe one downside if i don't wash my face night , i break out , probably because it really like " sealant " your face . other than , i love it , probably never switch base .	1

i've noticed products lush stores almost always smell different when you get them out store . store , i didn't like smell this shampoo bar all , but i bought it because awesome softening benefits seaweed . when i got home try it out , smell much nicer subtle . i guess all smells store take over you can't smell actual product accurately . this shampoo wonderful . only needed three strokes bar down my below-the-shoulder length hair my hair lathered up really nicely . just sure keep this shampoo bar ( all shampoo bars ) out water when you aren't using it or it turn into mush . took off star because traditional bottled shampoo much easier convinient work store . really nice take you trips , though . if you want shampoo conditioner bar , try hybrid or godiva	-1
i saw them use airspray type foundation america next top model ( not sure which brand ) but i impressed this technique wanted try it - only one i found dior . far best foundation i've tried ! i like other dior tint foundation - but thought it too heavy . mist feels light ... maybe little too light . yet once you apply , it job perfectly - you really get even airbrushed look . i won't give 5 stars simply price - sorry but $60 too much 2.3 oz cangood news if you apply it right it last while	-1
