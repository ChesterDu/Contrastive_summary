never i so unhappy my makeup i when i using clinique . i used stay beige ( which i lightly patted my face top clinique superfit liquid makeup - i oily skin told this would help reduce shine ) end result it just made me look ghostly . i also hated how clinique liquid foundation powder didn't matching shades , so i settle honey liquid beige powder . much i went back macy try convince them these weren't my shades , they just wouldn't listen . either they didn't time or patience help me pick new shade , or they convinced i making big deal out nothing . instead sitting there arguing them ( which i shouldn't first place ) i just switched different makeup line : laura mercier , which i am very happy . i've many other friends who unhappy clinique switched over different makeup brand , well . i'm not trying knock product . i'm just saying it wasn't me or many other people i know . i would definitely not recommend clinique anyone . i'd rather pay little more get better results rather than settle $20 product just because it affordable .	-1

i admit , i am sucker hair products . i very thick hair , times , little wild . i used fekkai products before , their okay . certainly not worth over inflated price tag . but i read reviews this product thought it might perfect solution my hair during winter months . wrong answer ! this product very thick , too thick me spread through my hair without putting some work into it . conditioners hair masks should well , conditioning . i left this hair mask required 20 minutes , it nothing . fact , i go back through my hair my $6.00 pantene conditioner just make my hair manageable . i also wonder what purpose putting pieces nut shells into product supposed condition hair ? all those pieces going rough up your hair cuticle . ladies , spend your money book reviews hair products ! i i've realized all hair products essentially same . only name perfumes change . read paula begoun book hair products	-1

i agree previous reviewer when i say possibly this " one ladies " . but only good way ! i first encountered this scent walking past fragrance counter mall many years ago . time , it seemed all fragrances men heavy musks , orientals , spices , etc . this ... er ... fruity . ( i see you cringing ! ) it lemony . like puff lemon cake . breeze over lemon field tuscany . ( there fields lemons tuscany ? i don't know , but it mental pic , go it ! ) spritz cologne following bit aftershave balm sure recipe get yourself sniffed cuddled . it doesn't bash you over head macho tones- it lures tingling tartness . i yet meet woman who dislikes scent . yes , i steal it my husband sometimes ! him ( light eyed blond ) it stays true bottle scent , but me ( brunette oily skin ) it morphs something vanilla notes lemon . i think it great " safe " gift people who aren't sure what cologne buy new male friend . i gave it four stars , because cologne need reapplied frequently maintain viable scent . fragrance lasts approximately four hours . but if you can't get noticed your lemony deliciousness four hours , you more problems than cologne fix .

laura mercier , far away , my very very favorite line lip color . over years , i tried hundreds lipsticks , glosses , pots , pencils , you name it . laura best . here why i like them : 1 . color natural semi-sheer so it looks light-weight , no matter what shade2 . colors not garish - you won't throwing them out next season . not say they boring , just timeless well thought out . 3 . they last long time . not all day , but i really hate those " all day " lip colors . mid-day , my lips so dry gross-flakey . i've thrown away more those cruddy " all day " lip colors than i care remember . back point , my laura lipstick easily lasts me through 2-hour presentation client . 4 . i only wear shimmer line fall , guess what ? metallics so " " fall 2005	1
