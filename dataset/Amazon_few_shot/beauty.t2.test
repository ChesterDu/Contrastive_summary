if you buy this shampoo , buy something else it get this glue out your hair . i guarantee you disappointed , it equivalent herbal essence . ( also leaves your hair like glue	-1
after using this product , i felt less than fresh . then i realized it only use hair skin your head . i would better off using evain spray gotten same effect less money	-1
i haven't outbreak acne 5 years until i started using this cream . i kept using it thinking my huge cysts couldn't possibly this very pricey stuff . i went dermo she said stay away these thick creams specifically anti-aging because they horrible your skin . i went back my cheap neutrogena lotion anti- aging it felt sooo much better lighter within week my skin cleared up . i didn't even realize how very thick this stuff until i started back my neutrogena . i feel so bad $$$ i lost i wish i would've gotten sample first . i encourage you same .	-1
i bought this eyeliner expecting great things , sorely disappointed . application difficult , mistakes almost impossible correct even if immediately , i can't soften line ( it * * smudgeproof ) . if you used brush-on-liquid-liner , very steady hand , want dramatic look , this might work you . i prefer softer line , so this didn't . also , it almost completely flaked off over course day . i'm giving it two stars because it really smudge-proof , no sliding or transferring . i didn't dark shadows smudging but i flakes , so i'm still not happy i t.t his definitely not worth pricetag	1
i used entire tube faithfully face cream over course several months . while i thought it moisturized fine , i not notice any change my lines , tone , texture . money i'd go get several tubes neutrogena anti-aging products - they work better , nicer texture smell much better	1
well i dint like smell all , i see nothing lovely this perfum , if ur looking good perfume give this holiday season , check out fantasy britney spears it smells so nice , or curious britney thats classic its must give or , . lo live smells really nice too so if i you i would rather not buy it if ur giving it present , or urself its not really worth ur money !	-1
after great success merkur classic i decided own up get futur . i super excited because i thought myself , " shoot , one pass instead two ... " not quite . starters razor bulking plain heavy . not kind heavy i'm comfortable trying shave i shouldn't feel i might drop darn thing . i started 1 first day get handle razor . not good shave , missed alot spots patches hair . so day two i went level 2 razor . same story , second verse . it left patches didn't shave well some areas . 2.5 areas got smaller but still ... they there . went 3 setting razor almost mangled myself . so next week i went back 2.5 it more consistantly , still gave me crappy shave . i give this one star because if it supposed better razor than anything before it , there shouldn't learning curve one double edge . least not one this severe . i get way better shave using my merkur classic i really think least me , this way go . i say use caution merkur futur . i also say if you're already getting good shave double edge you , don't buy new style sake buying new style . if you're double edge gets old ... buy new one same kind . only suggestion .	-1
i love cinnamon buns shower gel , so i thought i would try lip gloss . one thing , it smells/tastes nothing like cinnamon buns . i don't know what flavor , but i don't like it . maybe they added almond or something . secondly , it way too sticky . my hair kept getting stuck my lips . it reminds me vaseline . since i got this product kit , i cannot return it , but i not using it again	-1
i never tried anything philosophy wanted try 3 1 stuff , i thought lavendar pound cake would smell really good . i actually really disappointed . it sucks shampoo , body wash too- i ordered blueberry pie too , i haven't even used it , its just sitting my closet . price you get lot lasts long , but i wasn't impressed	-1
it true this product smells absolutely awful after it applied face . worse , it absolutely nothing . i applying significant amount morning night , 6 weeks , allowing it soak dry ... it nothing	-1
i got very irresistible givenchy perfume gift christmas . first smell , i loved it . then i spritzed it yikes ! 2 months ago i still scent me . it too flowery -- it not clean , fresh scent . more " i sprayed little too much potpouri here " scent . not people mild allergies perfumes either !!	-1
i agree reviewer . this product not worth price tag . it claims vanilla scent , it , but it barely noticible . don't buy this product based how it smells . moisturizer , you much better $23.00 .	1
ick . i bought ultra light kirsch because i thought it would similar discontinued grapey color i used love loreal . smell - fake grade-school grape-aid smell grossed me out . feel - i like lip gloss feels glossy . this stuff not shine enough or last long enough . color - color mild me . i very disappointed . i felt like i wasted money time . i still recommend loreal lip juice , though . i believe it same company , lip juice glossy , shiny , long-lasting way more cost-effective	-1
i used this product few times , trying justify money i spent . i could leave it my hair all day , effect essentially zilch . hair dead . it doesn't matter what propaganda beauty/cosmetics companies use promote their products , there no way vitamins , minerals , etc . going " feed " or strengthen your hair . when products washed out , so moisture . it dumb idea my part think putting guacamole my hair going make it a)smell good b)feel good . it really dumb me pay so much this stuff when i could've just easily much more cheaply made it myself	-1
its good waking up , because once you put it you feel refreshed because your lips feel fire . i like sting shine it . it finishes pretty fast roll ball may feel like little drag keep rolling lips , but i think it worth trying it unless you extreme sensitive lips , this stuff strong . i mention great smell ? yum ! me my boyfriend loved it .	1
its effect very much depends climate you live . if you live colder dry climate , especially during winter it exactly it promises - great moisturizer , lines diminished , puffiness . i really love using it - i am 35 currently living cold dry climate . but hot sometims humid climates , or during summer it just doesn't work well - i don't know why . i like it lot this my 3rd bottle , although i am using it seasonal eye care	1
if you like me get occasional zit when you least expect it , then this works out well . it not remove zit , but it cover nasty monster pretty well !! i put it under my lancome powder it really made difference . because it clear it blend whatever foundation or powder you use . oh yes it covers all redness comes those nasty zits . girls new best friend :	1
this currently my absolute favorite scent . i get so discouraged when smell somthing store love it , buy it , take it home put it , smells completely different me . i never problem this scent . it smells delicious bottle skin , if you like citrus . it smells like fresh , ripe orange , slightest hint spice . man my life finds it quite cuddle worthy . if you not familiar perfume oils , just somthing note . they highly concentrated , little goes long way . it also phases nicely , intense pleasently subtle long lasting . bonus there only few ingredients , so it less likely irritate sensitive skin . one bottle last last , there flexable applicator wand inside lid . i really can't say enough this wonderful fragrance	1
when i first tried this perfume , it reminded very much victoria secret pink -- it same distinctly sweet , strongly scented unique floral note , yet here bouquet significantly softer , sweeter . it would work well someone who likes sweet , girly scent light yet still pronounced . one drawback staying power poor : i couldn't detect any trait this just few hours later . this bit disappointing give high price , yet this still might good choice someone who looking everyday fragrance doesn't mind reapply	1
i : long , thick , fine hair naturally wavy . i don't color my hair but i get frizzies split ends , some dryness . i tried this product out after receiving small sample [ ... ] order , fell love it . i -love- smell , surprised other people didn't seem . i vastly prefer it some faker , more chemical smells lot shampoos seem use . i didn't use it leave , but deep conditioning treatment , afterwards i kept flipping my hair forward over my shoulder , both smell it just feel how amazingly soft it . this product left my hair looking healthy , shiny , gorgeous days . i get fair number compliments my hair general , but after i used this stuff i getting stopped street . everyone lady starbucks my professor mentioned how beautiful my hair looked . i highly recommend it . i tried lot hair products , including some ( like fekkai glossing cream ) made olive oil , better results ojon ( though i like lot fekkai products ) . other products i recommend : healthy sexy hair shampoo , conditioner , leave-in conditioner , jonathan product anti-frizz serum , origins happy ending conditioner , fekkai products curly straight hair , depending your mood :) products i don't recommend include suave fekkai glossing shampoo ( left my hair shiny all right , but frizzy . ) i would suggest ordering it sephora , they carry several sizes , give samples all online orders , very , very good taking returns , even if you've tried product out just don't like it	1
i like this scent . my first thought pears , before reading what notes , yes , apples . this not hardcore apple scent , but enough so . very fresh sweet but not too sweet . crisp spring-like . hint , tiny hint dandelions tiny bit rose , just tiny bit . my husband likes this scent me well , which saying lot . he hates roses foody scents , but still likes this .	1
i really like this product . i would not , however , agree person who said it entirely too strong scent . i would actually like it stronger , less peel more juice smell . but it nice scent , cleans very thoroughly . not best i've used , but very nice	1
this soap smells great ! smells just like cherry lollipop ! continues smell even after shower throughout day . mix i love juicy shampoo , american cream conditioner candy dusting powder	1
excellent pair shears . sharp durable . i expect them last long time	1
i thick , coarse , african-american hair relaxed ( permed straight ) . i usually use this product wet hair ( after shampoo)when blow-drying my hair straight . it makes it really smooth shiny . i received lot compliments my hair since i started using it . warm temperatures it melt down but my opinion it makes it easier use . when it solid you supposed rub it palm your hands liquify it then put it your hair . it smokey scent it but no one pays attention ... they looking how great my hair . i love ojon conditioner ( it very best i ever used)but shampoo my opinion seems dry my hair .	1
very good product great kind fruity smell . leave hair soft full " bounce " . easy comb hair after using this product but might combine kerastase conditionner very dry damage hair if your hair very long . price here still more expensive than europe : around 22 euros	1
i absolutely love clinique eye shadow . all their eye shadows go so smooth , never crease , just perfect shades colors my skin tone . almost peach color great because i use it highlighter under my brow or just base , either way i use it just every day ! :	1

smells great ! not too harsh my thin but long hair	1
i'm not makeup or product junkie any means , but simply can't miss even one day using my all lips . it cream ( much like moisturizer ) exfoliates smoothes your lips makes them fuller/plumper . it also fills any lines you may around mouth so i recommend using it not only your lips but also outside lipline . although i using it twice daily many years , i believe someone using it first time should see results fairly quickly . friends mine who wear lipstick ( i don't ) also claim if they use it right before they put lipstick it makes it go better last longer . ( apparently you also use this product eye cream smooth crowsfeet around eyes , but i havent tried this- i prefer caudelie eye serum cream . ) simply put , i highly recommend this product know you'll see results i !	1
it lovely light refreshing perfume . lovely daywear . loves it guys	1
this one my favorite perfumes . i love anything vanilla this great combination it violets , musk iris . it strong smell , so go easy it . one spray lasts all day .	1
i received tube philosophy cinnamon buns flavored lip gloss christmas ( other philosophy products ) . i super excited try this because i've told numerous people philosophy products spectacular . first , i must point out there sparkles this lip gloss . although they're very subtle your lips , if you're type gal who hates sparkles shimmer your makeup , i'd stay away this product . smell , it smell like cinnamon buns . it certainly not taste like it however ( which good thing ... i tend lick off my lip gloss if it tastes good ... this lip gloss not taste good ) . it very sticky thick so you don't use too much . it also stays your lips good amount time . would i suggest this product ? if you're looking good-smelling , long lasting lip gloss , i'd definitely recommend this . however , if these two things don't matter you i'd suggest you skip this ($10 tube lip gloss isn't cheap after all ) go drugstore brand lip gloss	1
i never found compact foundation , cream or powder , looked lasted even remotely well liquid foundation dusting powder over it . until now . this amazing makeup , best part it doesn't take whole lot product achieve perfect coverage . my skin tends red , but this doesn't even hint it . plus , it nice matte without too dry . everyday , this my time saving , face perfecting miracle .	1
i using this cream almost 2 months now results amazing . my sun spots lightened it also decreased redness my face . i continue use it highly recommend it .	1
emotionally healing benefits orange oil lavender become immediately apparent when you apply this your scalp . if you find someone give you head massage this product , then you truly relax . if applying this yourself , it works well home hair treatment nourish hair follicles promote healthy hair growth . you also notice your hair becoming stronger retaining much deeper shine . essential oils this product help activate micro-circulation which may cause slight tingling warming scalp . leave this 5-10 minutes then wash your hair normal . you may find you need less conditioner when using this product . many hairdressers use this product when giving conditioning head massage where i first found out this product . i bought my first bottle day i massage . i impressed i keep buying this product . ~ rebecca review	1
this shampoo totally fulfilled its promise bright , shiny hair me . i nice hair begin ( if i say so myself ) , but i used this conjunction one lush conditioners(american cream)and my friends told me i shampoo model hair day . i'm not crazy beer-ish smell , which why i'll give it four rating . however , it doesn't seem very strong once you wash it out benefit worth it	1
i don't know why nobody else likes this product , but so far it only one works my ingrown facial hairs .. yes , it stings bit when i put it , but it quickly goes away . it doesn't dry my skin out , it actually helps get rid dry , white-looking flaky skin after i shave . i used get ingrown hairs so bad my face they would there months . eventually i'd get point my own surgery needle try extract hair . if i get ingrown hair now , i just use tend skin once morning once before bed , it actually extracts hair it own ! it gets rid redness swelling also associated ingrown hairs . only time my life my face actually looks clear , tend skin product it me . before i finish , i'd just like add i'm kind person nothing ever works . any product i try , never advertised . whether it shampoo , deodorant , medication , etc . tend skin one rarities actually work me . believe me , i've tried lot products ingrown hairs	1
this product perfect dreadlocks . i buy it whenever i am us . i live caribbean even extreme heat this stuff best my hair type .	1

avobath bath bomb turns water lovely luminous pale green . avocado , olive oil , lemongrass , bergamot , rosewood oil , gardenia extract makes this skin calming , soothing , moisturizing dream . " green luster " makes this bath especially beautiful gives it mermaid mood . i loved this one so much , i'm ordering two next time . scent lemon/lime , but time you get tub , floral scents more prominent . you add some bubbles , but they don't seem last very long - well , i using bath gel . so , you may want find bubble bar because olive oil seems make them disappear pretty fast . least , my theory because i've noticed bath oil same thing . avobath goes well whoosh products or happy hippy shower gel . if you mood , you might want amazing " godiva " shampoo conditioner 2 1 bar ( magical quality - makes hair super shiny ) or " i love juicy " shampoo " veganese " conditioner . last two also citrus scent especially delicious . when i use lush products , i'm good mood all week long . it truly amazing how happy content i am long i some lush products around . :) ~ rebecca review	1

oh my gosh ! i love this lip gloss so much . i first bought one last year , it best item makeup i've ever bought ! it goes great over other lip gloss/lipstick or alone . all colors great , but i'd start our pink first . my personal favorite " spring fling " because it not so bright , but it still juicy . you deffinetly not regret buying one these . it worth every penny	1
i using this product years . i really oily t-zone , i find this product keeps it control . it very good cleanser removes oil without drying your skin . no matter what color your skin tone may , i think you like this product !	1
tounge-and grove way handle detached make it easy use shower ( dont my glasses ) . detachable brush medium soft bristles easy skin . strap brush cotton , so this probably isn't once-in-a lifetime purchase , but very good price . everybody needs one	1
i long , thick , wavy hair loves frizz up . i tried every anti-frizz , hairstyling product out there , they either didn't work or weighed my hair down . i didn't want like this hair dryer hoping it wouldn't live up hype ... but , it excellent my hair . after using dryer ( no styling product ) my hair straight , shiny felt great . me , it didn't change amount time i dried my hair , so if your considering buying it speed , don't , unless you thin or short hair . it worth $200.00 price tag ? depends you personally , but i recommend you shop around because there better deals out there	1
i tried just every hair product market this very much surpassed my expectations ! i wasn't sure when i put it my hair , but i styling it , i amazed . it created lot volume my hair stayed shiny . i am ready try rest product line	1
this one philosophy 3-in-1 products . it used shampoo , bubble bath , shower gel . i've only used it shower gel , so that all i'm able review here . shower gel , this product exceptional . it extremely rich thick gel , produces generous lather abundant bubbles . i find it somewhat moisturizing- it doesn't explicitly moisturize my skin , but it also doesn't dry it out , even winter . addition , gel opaque creamy , rather than clear , like most shower gel . melon daquiri scent summery fruity . it pleasant sweet melons scent . it doesn't smell especially alcoholic ; though it part philosophy line 3-in-1s meant smell like fruity cocktails- like margaritas pina coladas . scent more fruity melon than alcoholic melon . said , people who like juicy , fruity scents likely love this . while i haven't tried using this bubble bath or shampoo , rich lather i get shower gel suggests me it would probably work very well other two parts 3-in-1 . one thing may problematic people- scent doesn't last beyond shower . i can't smell it my skin anymore when i get out shower , though scent quite strong while use . some people may find problematic . i like it doesn't clash my perfume , so it okay me .	1
i admit i tried find cheaper sunscreen same things this one without irritating my skin , but i keep ending back this one . it awesome . it feels great your skin , works great , so lightweight . it so easy wear under makeup if necessary , it leaves flattering look skin . when it first showed up i thought it awfully small amount , but then i realized it only takes tiny , tiny amount cover your whole face because it water-light . so it lasts ( least me ) least month daily use . my opinion only thing they could improve this product would make it sweat/water-proof , but then it might not feel good skin it . i can't find better facial sunscreen money	1
i love pine . i want eat it . i am nature detective so i love out doors so this woodsy perfum great me	1
... what you've doing or last night . this stuff feels nice cool leaves this great shimmering highlight which looks absolute natural best out few other types i've tried . really nice stuff !!	1

i've using this product , mild facial soap dramatically different moisturizer , fourteen years now . i remember my consultation clinique rep like it yesterday . therein lies rub -- if you've never used these products considering doing so , it best visit clinique representative help you decide which products best your skin . lot times , people not know what skin type they or think they one when it really . if you're not using right ones your skin type , you won't get results you need . clinique reps help . talk them first then you purchase anywhere ! i myself combination skin . clinique rep warned me i might some initial blemishes , i , but they tapered off after week or so . just out shower , or after long day who knows what may gotten your skin , this uplifting , cooling-when-it's-hot , breath fresh zinginess . often one all over swipe this cotton ball not enough -- so use other side puff , dab more clarifying lotion apply again , maybe more cotton ball till it no longer turns any shade . this worth it . you taking off not only makeup facial soap may not caught , but any impurities daily activity attract skin -- dirty fingers unconciously rubbed over neck or cheek , etc . follow up clinique moisturizer that right you your skin feel five times lighter . your skin important . these products helped mine stay amazing shape over years	1
i've mild case eczema , so am also always keeping eye out products help my skin , without resorting cortizone creams ... i've some success past using straight jojoba coconut oil eczema patches - but not enough keep up hassle oily spots skin . i even tried making my own recipes - some success . but , it time consuming i just don't time mess around kitchen cosmetics hobby . after looking reviews various types lotions/creams lush line , i decided give this one go . i've only using it couple days , but already my skin less irritated , scaliness seems diminishing some . ( eczema strikes top my feet bit ankle ... makes wearing combat boots bit annoying when its acting up)i'll probably need week or two steady use really know if it works i'm hoping , but so far so good ... there no real strong scent lotion - so it shouldn't bother those who sensitive smells . so also pretty cool end well :-) works great rest my skin well !! no more dryness winter weather anymore	1
used night cream or moisturizer under makeup .	1
white linen lovely , soft , exquisitely feminine fragrance . it floral notes tone down true soft lingering beauty . this one my favorite lauder fragrances one i really recommend . 5 stars estee !!	1
this product really what it says - it lifts smooths , conceals too . it best concealer i've tried , i've tried many . one note though - lightest shade very light . i very fair skin found it too white , so i exchanged it 2nd shade , which would also work well fair medium skin . great product	1
i like clean fresh scent . it not too heavy not overpowering . it comes cute pink bottle	1
i looking new scent stumbled upon this . i sold instantly never gotten so many comments any perfume i ever worn before . well worth it !!	1
i've always really dry , chapped lips always putting lip balm under my lipstick , before bed , probably million times throughout day . but nothing seemed help ... lipstick always seemed dry them out even more nothing looks worse than dry lips lipstick . it just makes your lips look even drier . buzz latte lip balm most amazing product ever !!! it smells like coffee really strong first but then goes away . it doesnt taste bad either . yes , its $8 bucks tube ... but tube twice size normal chapsticks so cost evens out . this product lasts forever ... why ? because it stays so long ... even lipstick or lip glosses . first time i put this when i tried friends . within hours i noticed dramatic difference so i went out bought my own . my lips never so smooth full . bare escentuals continues suprise me all their products !!! i dont think i every try makeup line . i think what makes this product work so well its got lot shea butter it . but this product amazing ! you even dip it bare escentuals blushes or eyeshadows create matching lipstick . this absolute must any makeup collection or anyone who suffers dry , chapped lips . you wont sorry .... you'll notice difference right away	1
years , i paying more imported french mattifier devastated when company stopped selling here . i tried other popular mattifiers ( namely smashbox photo finish ) , but this far best . turns out it good thing i forced find product . this product makes my shine huge pores my cheeks just vanish . i'm matte longer during day , since blush sticks this product well , i don't need foundation . i'd recommend it anyone wants their skin surface look smoother less shiny . i'm not huge fan clinique general , but this one product keeps me coming back	1
i love this shower gel , coming me , high praise , since i not love shower , am especially crabby when this activity must morning . you see , i much prefer languish warm bath , letting bubbles work getting clean me , instead devoting my energy good book . yet when i'm standing shower , enveloped clouds delicious blackberry steam , i am miraculously transformed crabby morning shower girl into very happy girl who then goes her merry way walks up friends work offering arm encouraging them " smell me " . lovely !!	1
i've used this product year couldn't happier . i am not ' makeup person ' this product just what i need smooth out my complexion moisturize my oily skin . fine lines large pores appear less noticable , skin remains shine-free , skin tone appears more even skin feels softer . one recommendation ..... directions tell you wait 2 minutes allow product ' set ' . get best finish , especially if applying powder ( like i ) or foundation over primer , you need wait full 2 minutes . this can't stressed enough .	1
product tip-top shape , itself wonderful fragrance , but i ordered hopes getting it here certain date it not arrive time i hoped . gift-wrap very lackluster could much better . good product , bad delivery	1
i love baby grace !! it so pretty mellow girly . i usually spray am i keep this solid my purse refresh during day . it long lasting doesn't stain clothing or make you sticky	1
lush famous scent , this one unforgettable . check ingredients this one -- great soft water shampooing	1
i love taste this , it so yummy . tastes like lemon cookies cake . looks good too . i would give it 5 stars except only downer philosophy glosses they pretty sticky , so if you animals , you get fur stuck your lips sometimes , or whatever . you know what i mean , sticky gloss attracts things . but it looks good tastes very good	1
always , this delivered very timely manner i completely satisfied	1

this cutest packaged eyeshadow market . brush sits down shadow perfect amount powder gets it . if you don't get much shadow tip , just shake bottle little brush fills up more more dramatic effect . unlike other loose eyeshadow powders you use your own brush , this doesn't get too much brush or your eyelid it easy layer . it fantastic shimmer it each color looks good my skin color ( which really rare most cosmetics ) i can't tell you how much i love this stuff ! so go ahead buy it , don't forget shake bottle cap brush each time you apply so powder re-dispursts bottle . :	1
karma smells just like head shop me . you decide yourself if floats your boat or not . powder smells even more delicious than perfume . my only problem it texture . it slightly gritty . i wish they would fix . it may sound strange , but also , if you use powder white undies , it color them orange ..	1
this product good . only problem eyebrow tint looks kind weird part where you don't eyebrows . i only use it when i am putting lot makeup , otherwise it looks kind fake everyday use . coloring really good blondes	1
i'm really anal scented/flavored lipglosses- especially ones scented or flavored vanilla , but mac lipglass isn't vanilla-ish all ! it got very pigmented color , it stays long time gloss , each tube lasts long time ... don't let what other reviewer said vanilla scent throw you off	1
i've using this product years . every now then i try product hopes finding something little cheaper . i never found anything comes close this one . i'm over forty , but still somewhat oily skin , get breakouts occasion . if i use this two three times per week , i definitely notice i fewer breakouts . my skin smoother more even . i like menthol feel . i don't smell it all , find it refreshing . i've also tried 7-day scrub don't find it come close this product . grains 7-day scrub few far . exfoiliating scrub , they very concentrated . too much ? just add little water . i only hope clinique doesn't stop making this	1
i stumbled upon this shower gel collection this past christmas season . i knew right away this would perfect solution lot holiday gifts my list . i pleased i could knock off number ladies off my list one purchase . i even happier free shipping $30 amazon gift card offer they going time . i couldn't wait package arrive . i ripped into it soon it got me . gels all packed nicely sturdy box handle philosophy . i restrain myself keeping all gels . i managed give away nine them after some agonizing deliberation . ( mint chocolate chip , lemon custard , berry ones mine . ) plus cool box made perfect container all my other gels i rotate according season . i'm big fan most philosophy products . they some awesome smelling shower gels well wonderfully working skincare products . i already familar excellent cinnamon buns double cocoa scents so i figured most these should pretty darn good too . mint chocolate chip nice but lemon custard weaker smelling out bottle . all their 3-in-1s , oh well , some hit where others miss . all their 3-in-1s , shower gel makes mounds lather , cleans your skin usually without drying , works fairly well shampoo too - though conditioner typically needed . i like shower gels lot . i know my gal pals enjoyed their christmas gift too . all things considered , this fantastic deal !	1
scent cynthia sylvia stout shampoo fabulous , sticks you , shampoo also great . price steep , yes , but worth it . don't bother 3.3 oz " trial size " because you'll most likely only waste shipping charges go order bigger bottles next time	1

i using these since sometime early 1990s . before web made them easier find , we used ask family friends visiting hawaii pick them up us . i've recommended them many others over years because they easier than back brush , more vigorous than wash cloth , quick-drying . salux brand rougher ( i think better ) than imitations i since seen	1
i don't know how many mascaras i own but there always two or three i hold my favorite or just different occasions . one those hypnose i really like it when i go out or just looking dramatic look . postive : 1 . ) look : i've never neccessarily wanted wear fake eyelashes but they look almost perfect . unbelievably , hypnose gives you look . it amazing just how feathery your eyelashes look . 2 . ) flaking : this mascara never really flaked bottom my eyes . that really important me . negative : 1 . ) this mascara starts out great but after two half weeks it starts emptying out you . this might just because there days when i reapplyed it or simply because i just used it pretty well ( 1 coat just everyday because how much i liked it ) . summary : if you want natural yet " those real lashes ?! " look , then you'll like this mascara . i'm giving it four stars instead five simply because how long it lasts but if you use it once it while , then it last you while	1
my background : i used gillette sensor . it okay . i upgraded sensor xl . it pretty good . i tried mach 3 , i hated it -- it felt like i wiping my face wall blades . i finally settled sensor 3 -- nearly 2 bucks blade . it got job , but there no real joy shaving . considering i it least once day ( twice if i'm going out night ) process should more enjoyable . after quite bit research , including newsgroups customer reviews , i splurged got merkur futur ( though i got chrome finish ) . shaving awesome , i literally look forward it . lathering up shave cream ( i use crabtree evelyn sandlewood ) this brush real treat . super soft , holds ton water , results thick lather . ( warned , first few times you use it , it stinks like wet badger ... but it goes away ) . razor itself heavy ... i mean heavy . which good , because you need let razor work -- no pressure , or you take off you face ) . main difference this razor shaving cartridges , you actually feel blade against your face ( opposed chunk plastic ) . anyone who shave barber knows how great this feels . once i got technique down it close smooth shave i ever . finishing up cold water splash , non-alcoholic toner / aftershave , moisturizing lotion , invigorating way start day . please note : stated above brush smells little " badgery " first , but it goes away . head razor not pivot , so you follow contours your face . head itself it bulky , so you work your technique around your nose , under you chin . sum , this razor adds old-school , refreshing routine my mornings . i love it , would whole-heartedly recommend it .	1
