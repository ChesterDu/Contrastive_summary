we bought this when our baby born ( 6 months ago , only used it few times until recently ) . he loves it now get him sleep . problem lies 4 am , my husband i awake hear mobile playing ... scares us death since no one else should around start it . we go into nursery our child holding it playing animals .... clip holds umbrella part broken off , causing mobile fall baby . ( he thought it funniest thing world , he okay , thank god . ) but little plastic hook piece his hand . if you 6-month old child you know they eat everything they find . i thank god he didnt put his mouth . it great soother baby , but sure there no defects every day ! like i said before , other than this , it great .	-1
leak-o-matic fully lived up its name . new parent , i don't time things once , forget doing things twice . i need simple reliable- leak-o-matic neither . it worked ok first few times , then i partially filled tub put all items nearby necessary bathtime . time i returned baby hand , leak-o-matic dribbled all over laundry room counter , soaked all my other items counter , water ran down onto floor , under baseboard , dripped upstairs landing onto downstairs foyer floor . leak-o-matic hindenburg all baby bathtubs . it too bad i cannot give it zero stars . there many people who say you just assemble them correctly , but judging number irate mommies here , i conclude it either too complicated design or just plain crappy engineering . think it- number people young children who took time go online tell everyone this thing piece cheese ! cups feet stick countertop so you unable positon tub once it attached . fabric mesh incline allows baby slide down into water , so you're always repositioning baby . i'm surprised this thing didn't come built toaster ' added safety ' . i not research every single item registry- i figured if big stores carried it then it must least " ok " . back it goes . if you buy this thing , then good luck you , don't burn toast !	-1
i bought this chair because great reviews , i hesitated spending so much , but figured all features would worth it considering my son would using it couple years . pros : i like i roll it around table , or sink clean up after meals . height adjustment easy convenient . cons : folding it up didn't quite work i thought it would . it didn't lock into folding postition ... didn't really save much space . i would prop it against wall , hope no one knocked it down . we finally stopped folding it up . toys connect tray too dangerous my son , he would usually hit himself face them when he younger , time he older , i didn't really need them . battery operated toy funny smell it whenever it running while . he like it ... but buttons too hard him press when he younger . my son discovered 7 months how pull off extra tray go into dishwasher , so we don't use . he 13 months now , last week discovered how disconnect tray itself fling it off high chair . i washed seat cover per instructions , half time not use dryer , even though it said it could go into dryer , now seat bubling cracking ... i place cloth diaper seat protect my son legs . if i not spent $90.00 chair i would not disappointed ... but he only used it 7 months .	-1
thing you likely use most nail clipper . but it very blunt !!! special cover clipper makes cutting nails impossible , unless baby nail very very long . if i wait until nails long enough cut this thing , my 3-month-old would scratched his face head . i end up buying new baby nail clipper big handle magnifying glass nearby pharmacy . worked much better .	-1

i looked alot other reviews before i bought wished i hadn't because . you can't go off someone else experience , you really experience it yourself . first all it too bulky . suction thing tub didn't stick it way when i tried shower kept falling down . my poor baby kept sliding because there no non-skid bottom tub , so i go out buy small mat put bottom . i bought this tub only because my baby out growing fold away bath chair but it looks though i continue using it buy larger one her . i very temped send it back but i'm just going sell it ebay . i'm sorry but it waste money me . i'm happy it aleast work out other moms , maybe mines defected !	-1
i went chp office get my car seat checked , officer said car seat protection mats not approved considered major safety hazard because it causes car seat become loose . if you use these mats , car seat not installed tightly enough real danger during automobile accidents . don't buy !	-1
product claims carry children up 40 lbs . my daughter only 27lbs . it could not hold her . while it all pockets looks like higher end carriers it not . after one day amusement park straps started strain seperate fromt he carrier . i returned this item got sherpani rumba which wight limit 70lbs . i love it . also , cross terrain claim " load balancing straps distributes weight off parent shoulder onto hips " it not . i horrible pain after hour . both my upper lower back . i suggest you don't waste your money go higher end products like sherpani kelty . this work smaller child , but only if you compfortably carry weight . i like easily adjustable seat back . i able adjust my height my husbands .	-1
i bought this product i going long trip . i put batteries mirror it not work . i put batteries remote it still not work . all would happen little red light would flash you couldn't even turn it off without taking out batteries . waste money !	-1
we received this product off our baby registry couple months before our due date never used it until week before delivery . it worked first time , but never again ! i repeat we used it one time then it stopped working , it just would not turn !!!!! i asked retailer store credit but it after their return period . i then sent email first years explaining situation never received reply . lousy product !	-1
i initially very happy this product . we purchased it transition our 2-year-old double bed . however , plastic hinge bracket broke after several months use . since i liked product , i thought maybe i didn't it adjusted correctly bought second one . it , too , broke ; so i'm now looking sturdier alternative	-1

i thought i would love this , but it just takes too much time energy . germs go through cloth once it wet saliva . then this material rubbed all over cart then i put it my car etc . i just don't see difference not using it . my hands touch it , baby hands touch it etc . i enough keep track bag , baby , wallet , cell phone .... i just dont enough keep track giagantic piece material ! my grocery store those sanitary wipes outside store carts i wipe down handle bar .... far more effective against germs . you better off buying $3 thing purel hand cleaner than this bulky , ineffective cloth	-1

bumper very cute colorful i excited put it baby crib ... until i put it ... no matter how i tried fit it onto crib ( it white spindle jenny lind crib full-size ) it fit very akwardly never quite right . there large spaces where it should fit snugly around inside crib . i very disappointed since it very colorful matches sheet comforter we received gifts	-1
reasons why i not like this potty : 1 ) shield falls off one touch , ussually into potty ! 2 ) potty many cracks crevices bottom collect pee numerous ways . 3 ) it cumbersome empty potty . 4 ) once shield lost ( since it impossible keep attached ) it hard boys sit down not make mess . i highly recommend bjorn potty since it all one piece built shield	-1
suction these bowls so weak baby pulled it off highchair dumped contents few seconds flat . they come lovely colors , though	-1
so ... i bought this our 7 month old . what nightmare . what previous posters said this thing true . it hard get it stay put cart while you put your kid it . it just doesn't happen . then ... when you get your baby , seat portion so narrow it barely width your child hind end . forget bar cover . it just narrow . this thing covers just small area if you child like mine , they reaching over touching everything . add it , back cusion part doesn't even go up top back support . my daughter totally whacked her head back cart seat screamed . cusion part totally doesn't cover it . just bad . just spend extra cash buy something covers whole darn cart	-1
we ordered double stroller because it really good reviews it sounded like it would fit us perefctly . our children 2.5 10 months . our 2 year old almost outgrown back her head higher than back support . also 6 months we two different stollers because both issues rain shield , peek boo window cracking , also black out line seam came apart red fabric . kickers when we pick up our stroller airport mexico latch mechanism gave away when my two kids it . it cloapsed because locking system melted ..... oops , i guess someone forgot check part test !!	-1
i bought this car seat because it looked actractive safe . well , after one month i returned it because it worst car seat ever . car seat sits so upright my sons head always falling completely forward . he never looked comfortable . car seat comes strap covers suppose make car seat comfortable . these things only make it worse because they extremely rough bulky . this car seat extremely heavy even without infant it . carrying handle joke because you push canopy back put your arm under it . canopy also terrible because it barely works . it only works when sun directly above you sky . i constantly change direction i carrying car seat avoid sun beaming his face . ( unlike graco where you pull shade all way down ) i hated returning this because i really liked looks it but i my sons sake . i bought graco seat blackwell print ( which o.k. looking fabric ) . we both soooo much happier . he looks comfortable little more reclined . sun isn't his face i $130 extra dollars i spend something else . i think people mainly buy peg perego because they like way it looks ( i ) or because they expect it high quality because high price ( i ) . but actuality it just sucks . i wish graco would make their prouducts little more stylish because they definitly more practical functional .	-1
i received this seat gift told how wonderful it . i large baby . he almost 17 lbs four months old . so his thighs bottom barely fit it after three four months age . he also able get out it bu straightening his back legs . he didn't seem very happy it . it may work better if you smaller baby , but chubbier ones never fit long	-1

i this exact same soft light green deluxe pillow . i bought pillow when she 2 weeks old . i wearing it almost all day long every day since . she 11 weeks old today . she so comfortable when nursing this pillow . cushion made firm foam . she falls asleep pillow while it around my waist . even when she not nursing or napping , pillow helps me support her weight when i'm sitting or standing . it fits me very comfortably even though i'm plus size . only drawback i need order additional slipcover because it only hung dry , although it machine washable . i really love this fabric , but apparently , this fabric not available purchase separately slipcover , so i guess i'll try oatmeal twill cover .	1
after reading reviews reluctantly we bought stroller . i am glad we didn't listen those naysayers . it best decision we made because stroller wonderful . comments people wrote how stroller awkward heavy bunch rubbish . yes , stroller heavier than its predecessors but they fail mention how sturdy it . we've stroller 2 weeks we hike up some hilly mountains ( stanford dish if you palo alto ) it rides smoothly . it gives me comfort stroller well built protecting our two daughters ( 2 year old 4 weeks old enfant ) . i feel secure stroller not fall apart after few rides like its predecessor . also , we love capabilities , spring shocks smooth ride , shorter so we navigate through some tight corners it not awkwardly long like other double strollers . we toyota sienna it fits just fine our back trunk . weight . yes , it heavier but come , it not " 10 " times heavier . people exaggerate too much . if you accustom carrying your 30 pound toddler your arms , then stroller nothing . people too much wimp . it slightly heavier than its predecessors but not much . they made it heavier because load baring bar what keeps stroller steady sturdy . gives me peace mind my precious asset life ( my two daughters ) protected . only recommendation back two wheels could squeak which annoying . just use silicone spray they all went away . we've through rain , dirt , hot sun this stroller we've so happy it . i highly recommend purchasing it . but make sure you truck , mini-van , or suv . i am not sure if standard vehicle house such stroller . but i figured if you two toddler/enfants , you may consider getting bigger car	1

when we our kids , this mirror really great giving rear-facing child seat occupant ( would our boys ) view driver driver view their faces . soon enough they outgrew seating layout mirror got stowed door pocket . it great kids us we really got lot use out it . but wait , we weren't it yet ! when i got my jeep , i happened come across little mirror again decided try it blind spot mirror . i never liked those little circular ones go side mirrors because they take up too much room they're so small they aren't really very useful . instead i stuck this mirror up left corner my windshield where only thing it blocked low flying aircraft . it provides rear-view covers my blind spot perfectly large enough actually see what going . added bonus because it inside , it never gets wet , icy or fogged up . it my windshield ever since . kids 7 9 now so little mirror almost decade old it still sticks window survived several bumps never broke ! not bad few bucks	1
my floor becoming sea crunched-up goldfish crackers smooshed raisins . car rides consisted me tupperware snacks passing them back my one-year-old because given chance , he would dump whole thing . so snack traps life-saver . he still reach , grab handful throw if he wants , but mostly they've helped keep things clean .	1

i wash all my stuff either dishwasher or using sterilizer . my only complaint it isn't bigger . my son goes through least 7-8 bottles day ... even though there spots 8 bottles ... there isn't enough room my other pieces parts ( we use dr. brown bottles ) . if you dr. brown bottle user , know it works great 5 bottles ... i put my tubes " basket " part ... they stand up just fine .	1

i using blanket my newborn would wake up all night make sure she hadn't kicked off covers ( or kicked it over her face ) . since purchasing this , i don't worry all . she stays warm all night . one recommendation ... buy cotton sleepsack . i fleece sleepsack first it seemed keep baby too warm . cotton tight-knit weave feels warm enough ... even our cold illinois winter nights .	1
this works great our huge king size bed really thick mattress . it also works well no bed frame . you just shove horizontal legs mattress foundation boxes ( or box springs ) it stays place nicely . easy add take away looks clean streamlined . gives me piece mind night my 10 month old baby won't able roll out bed . morning when he wakes though he stands up shakes it so i get up right away pick him up before he throws himself over top it . it only works while baby sleeping but i don't think many potential buyers would expect more out it anyway . it great- highly recommend	1

lady below who said they dont fit her eddie bauer pack play needs realize eddie bauer not pack play - eddie bauer cosco considered just play yard - all play yards not considered equal . name quot ; pack playquot ; exclusive brand therefore these sheets fit just fine . gave them four stars because they're not most luxurious or long lasting sheets block , but they serve their purpose fit just fine	1

i so happy my purchase i bought one my baby nephew .	1
we use this our second child , it help him sleep * much * better . i wish we it our first child ! we own both fleece cotton versions , i prefer fleece - it not get loose quickly cotton one . despite name , this not swaddler itself any but most placid plump babies . our kid easily work his arms out ( usually through slit arm wrap bottom pouch ) if he fussy . however , we still use this daily - top swaddle recieving blanket . this way , swaddle not come undone . yes , you could same diaper pin , but things stay together much longer much neater this than diaper pin ( or even second swaddle recieving blanket . i haven't found good way use it car seat which i feel comfortable - swaddled kid his legs together , doesn't he ? - but we sometimes use it , cocoon style , baby bjorn or sling carrier , it quite magical soothing	1
what amazingly great stroller . this umbrella stoller all bells whistles . it light enough but yet heft . there detachable canopy ... basket underneath ... mesh baggy bottle holder ... winter boot ... rain cover sun shade . there so much . where child lays there even way elevate legs ... you usually don't get lighter strollers . if it gets too hot summer , you even remove some fabric seat so it ventilated . i would say my favorite part canopy there zipper parents store what necessary . first time i seen . haven't really tested it yet , but it seems roll smoothly , close down easily open just easily . i love fact i push up levers back stroller my barefoot .... usually it hurts through my boots . great buy ... you won't regret it . navy one really look black , but canopy seems navy . accents look hot pink picture actually red . good looking	1
this thing awesome ! we 7 month old she just loves this stroller ... so mom ! stoller so lightweight easy maneuver you take it almost anywhere . we live small city stroller handles uneven pavement curbs beautifully . i also taken stroller off-road trail running long i lock front pivot wheel , stoller easily manage rocks , branches , etc . this stoller given me so much flexibility opportunity get out house my daughter ... especially recreationally . things you love stoller : - very easy push , turn maneuver - lightweight - quick release wheels ( all them ) - great shocks - adjustable ( large ) sun visor - folds up compactly - easy use brake front wheel pivot release - cool colors ( we lime green ) - reflectivethe only thing i could recommend enhanced feature would shoulder strap easier carrying . this product great buy defintely worth money !!!!	1

i got this stroller last week ... i agree other reviewers skip joovy ... i only got one because i thought more expensive stroller better . i wrong ... joovy way too heavy hard push - no tray carry anything , not big basket bottom . sit stands front seat way bigger . my 4.5 year old more room back sit stand . i 4.5 year old no means short neither she 44 inches weighs 42 lbs 7 month old weighs 15 lbs . i love infant car seat holder . this works our really well ... i didn't know they this option when i bought it so it bonus me since i thought i going take my 7 month old daughter out her carseat put this stoller , but i just put my infant carseat there . this stoller compatable almost all infant car seats - we graco . it it no means all hard push ... my 4.5 year old loves sit back baby ... definately worth $120 ... i wish i would gotten this one before joovy . i taken this stoller airport shopping so far it made my life easier 4.5 year old infant . i am 5'7 handle push perfect my height - usually problem i other strollers handles lower .	1
this bouncer model best available currently market , even though there few flaws room improvement , other amazonians pointed out . but it work keeps our baby entertained , while leaving parents some much needed time other important things around house . sounds lights easily activated baby movement , but volume not adjusted . vibration mode could keep baby amuzed 1/2 hour first month , but later our baby got used it not care it before . we also like use this bouncer without play bar , simple comfy chair . this way baby could listen see parents or watch together ' baby first ' tv . i higly recommend this product new parents or baby shower gift	1

although those hospital blankets absolute best swaddling , these little suckers best if you're away home trying wrap up screaming infant couch your mother-in-laws , grass picnic , etc . nice tight wrap but cool enough summer , although they little small size so you should just get small medium . time they fit into large , swaddling isn't really needed	1

when i got this pump , it because i single mother my mom wanted give me night off once while . i chose this one because i orginally intended only use it occasionally i didn't much money . then i developed candida ( yeast ) infection my nipples simply would not go away . nursing too painful , but pumping bearable , so effort continue providing milk nature helped me make i used this pump . sure , suction wasn't industrial-strength , i one breast time . however , pump job almost same amount time my son finished his bottles , i even able pump little extra longer-term storage . i able use this pump steady efficiency two months straight ... my son never once any formula . if you planning returning work , i not recommend you purchase this particular pump . go ahead get yourself time-saving double pump . however , if you really going use this just occasionally , i would recommend this product	1
my 4 year old son just didn't fit our new kitchen table chairs . we tried phone books , but they moved ended up floor half time . we pulled out his old hard plastic booster seat but he just too big it . i purchased cooshie booster it perfect !!! he fits it lots room ( he big kid ) , its not all small standard plastic booster seats super soft material really great ! awesome product i highly recommend bigger kids , since it not secure onto chair or seat belt , i won't use it my 20 month old daughter .	1

my wife i very happy this highchair . adjustable height works well , well reclining positions back seat . it folds up relatively thin storage , wheels nice touch . unfortunately , entire tray assembly , while great its ability chose how close or far it baby , requires two hands remove or adjust . thankfully , 5-point-harness keep even squirmiest babies safely place while you use those two hands take care tray . it would nice few more themed toys or gadgets . tiger-teething-ring nice ( attaches tray so it won't fall floor ) , but most other fisher-price high chairs this price range come lot more baby . that our only hangup . otherwise , this good value	1
