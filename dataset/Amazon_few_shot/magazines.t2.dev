this magazine great just keeping spirit . it filled many success stories . but hardly any those success stories include details led them into success . it also extremely geared towards franchising . every other article , every other ad franchising . i one year subscription this point i'm bored . i'll keep subscription , but it highly unlikely i renew next year . *** though one should check out their web site entrepreneur.com . you find it total opposite magazine , prove great wealth information	1

i use subscribe shape several years ago , then it packed full great work out routines , meal plans , etc women all levels fitness . well . . . my last few months shape complete disappointment . i found very few pages good genuine fitness healthy eating advice . instead , it ranks right up glamour category magazines highest percentage advertisements , nearly all excercise material supposed " quick fix " fitness fluff which gives women very unrealistic expectations , healthy eating advise absolutely elementary . there no substance here women like me , average working woman who desire live healthy life everyday limited time commit exercise . i want magazine inspiring focus living sustained healthy lifestyle , not joke getting flat abs week illustrations perfectly chiseled models who obviously not face body challenges average women . i'm sorry but most women not going look like " her " after two weeks , or many months shape 10-30 minute day routines , but they sure lead you beleive so . i highly recommend " her sports " it magazine women desiring live active , day-to-day healthy life	1

this magazine took radical change direction earlier this year , meaning most reviews prior april 2006 essentially reviewing different magazine . i subscriber since early 90 recently cancelled . this magazine mid ( end life ? ) crisis now wants cover just anything uses electricity . cars ! why would i pick up pc magazine read car review ? their " improved " layout uses cartoonish hand drawn arrows " cool " sayings replace actual review content . what their market here ? 12 year old geeks extra $80k laying around drop suv ? get real . until this magazine makes radical change direction get back topic , it best avoided	-1
i found cat fancy magazine mostly advertisements breeders advertisements than real meat information cat owners . i'm also very unimpressed their cat channel online board they advertise cat fancy cannot recommend it others . they seem poor management their online board especially weekends so inappropriate posts stay there long time professional magazine advertising their own online board their magazine should their online board perfected before offering it . also cat fancy pushes ridiculous high renewal rate their magazine , but if you go onto amazon , you get renewal rate almost half cat fancy renewal price . so i come conclusion cat fancy magazine , their poor online cat channel board high renewal rate cat fancy charges , they not interested keeping their readers or online members .	-1
this magazine chock full supplement advertisements . advertisements fashion magazines annoying , but supplements unhealthy dangerous . these ads may something target audience magazine ... it seems directed women who hard core weightlifting fitness , level competition . recent article magazine talking what percentage body fat too low women . some women body fat below 10% - i'm trying get mine below 30% . it just different fitness/weightloss league completely . i like magazines like fitness shape better because it sets more reasonable goals provides more reasonable advice . i substitute toast jam bagels cream cheese . i can't drink protein shakes breakfast lunch , eat 10 servings protein day , pop potentially dangerous pills . i am very disappointed this magazine ..	1

it beyond me why any pre-teen or teen would want read this kind magazine . i reading this magazine couple weeks ago ski trip because my 13-year old friend happens get it her mail . truth , this magazine lacks substance . i don't see why people even care what jojo friend thinks her celebrity , how mk recovering hospital anorexic or what jesse mccartney marital status . leave celebs alone ; let them live their life . i've seen same things printed this magazine over over . this magazine shallow downright materialistic ( i.e. some articles i seen various covers " get him anything you want ! " , " what jesse mccartney nickname ? " " terrified alone ? " ) . i don't like most magazines , but if you want mag real substance , look forth seventeen or cosmogirl ! magazine . preteens -- skip this magazine . editors write level 2nd graders understand . read anything but this -- your local newspaper , even national geographic ( one my favorites ) . this magazine $17 10 issues--don't you think that bit pricey ? if you're parent , please don't buy your daughter this mindless garbage . can't you find anything decent your kids read ?	-1
