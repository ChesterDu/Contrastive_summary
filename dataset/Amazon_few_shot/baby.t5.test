we nothing but problems receiver . we it our kitchen it no more than 30 feet our son bedroom . any time we walk near receiver it beeps loss signal . beep very annoying because it won't stop until you move out way . if we open fridge door it beeps also . we've tried all frequency combinations no luck . it also very subsceptible interference makes loud crackling sounds , even low volume , until you change frequency . when it works sound quality very good , although it hard lower volume enough so night you not awakened your child simply rolling over or babbling their sleep . we recommend angelcare movement sensor monitor bebe sounds . sound quality great it comes sensor pad you place under your baby mattress . it senses each time your baby takes breath . if there no movement it sounds alarm . great insurance against sids !	-1

i think floppy seat great idea -- aside cleanliness factor , my son would too small just sit regular cart seat area ; this way , i pad him he secure . however , i find it very difficult manage . i see previous reviewer said she puts it cart one hand -- i say kudos her because i find it extraordinarily difficult hold my almost-20 lb . baby one hand put floppy seat cart other ! elastic keeps it when it , but it also makes it so you physically stretch it over sides cart ... i challenge you it one hand ! also , i think act strapping baby dangerous . i am trying hold him seat one hand feed strap through tiny hole back floppy seat other ... you really aware what your baby doing because point s/he not strapped easily fall out . all said , once baby properly " installed " , it make convenient trip down grocery aisles	-1

we love this item . i so upset when we got this stroller due fact not spot drink . this item solved problem . highly recommended	1
i harmony seven months use it 2-3 times day . it it still working great all original parts . i not buy replacement anything . i admit i recently tried pump . it supposed more closly mimic suckling baby . two days i called company , i got refund am back my harmony . this great pump i am so happy we bought it . stop searching buy this pump	1
we also used this netting last spring/summer/fall our double stroller ( limosine style ) our pack-n-play . addition bugs , it keeps leaves , etc . falling into play pen . my in-laws loaned us second play-pen older larger than one sold these days . netting also fit but not snugly	-1
i like this sheet so much better than thin ones . it offers more padding seems so much more comfy ! it tight fit , but i no problem fitting sheet onto my eddie bauer pack play . so , i would assume it should fit any pack play . just make sure wash cold water , hang dry . i never put this dryer . only thing i don't like color . it happens match my navy blue playard , but i wish it came some lighter colors	-1
this absolutely best bottle market . after working daycare nanny , i preference these . then after my sister my nephew used them i knew minute i found out i expecting i would using them too . reason i love these bottles so much they very easy baby latch onto . most other bottles use very small nipples whereas these use nipple quite large , more like breast . if you think how woman body made really look nipples you see what i mean . able latch better allows them eat better much less gas spit up . i also love how easy they warm up bottle warmer or crock pot . because they use liner , milk heat up much quicker than standard bottle thick plastic - very important thought 3am !!! some people think always liners costly annoying . but not really . 100 eight ounce liners cost $8 last 2 2 1/2 weeks . so not bad you might think . ( if this truly issue you , consider advent bottles . they also relatively large nipples . but because they not use liner , you cannot eliminate air bottle they take much longer warm up . )	1
i love this stroller , tell all my friends it . our daughter 3 months old when i purchased it . there not better rated stroller available when i researched , there still not . you run , walk or rollerblade behind this stroller feel confident your child safe . lilyana now 4 1/2 months loves going our daily walks , occasional rollerblading . she fussy girl , ( only ) when it comes strapped down carseat , but loves comfort hammock like feel bob . we live florida , sun-guard canopy , she well covered . some other factors which made we chose bob : * braking mechanism , which hard find , wrist strap which if you should fall , locks back wheels ( unlike most strollers market ) . this feature great rollerbladers . * 5 point safety harness * 70 pound weight limit ( highest i found )* metal frame ( others more plastic metal )* shock absorbers , great rocking/bouncing her sleep * swivel front wheel , which locks simple pin . * simple lily likes it , we tried several others , all babies-r-us stock . cost pretty high , but would you put price safety your child , if you fall while exercising ? thanks hearing me out	1
it still waiting baby arrive , so i haven't used it yet .... but i love utility design it	1
we twins these mattress pads much more convenient than trying wrestle getting new sheets cribs middle night . they holding up well through frequent washings easy attach . i gave it 4 stars because it not extremely soft , though it isn't bad . i also like top layer breathable - gives me peace mind	-1
very cozy -- great wrapping up after bath get warm . but honestly , it usually laundry . since swaddling lasts short period time , it use pretty limited . however , when it clean , i like it around .	-1
we very pleased how easy this install , despite fact we rather unusual banisters . ours actually half wall half banister , but plastic just flexible enough bend over ledge . directions weren't great , but it fairly self explanatory . we feel much more comfortable letting our one-year old play upstairs loft now	1
we bought this when my daughter newborn , we surprised her peg perego car seat fit into it so well , now shes year half even if home she climbs into it plays steering wheel . she always loved it , snow ground picnics , its great , lot better than plastic wheels , front tire swivels also little switch so it becomes more like jogging stroller front wheel doesnt move . weve really liked it so far , except harness not fitting very tiny baby , its great . only thing now i 2 kids i cant use it cause i need double	1
while not portable i assumed it would ... it great space saver over std . highchair great	1
this seems secure seat , our almost-5-year old comfortable it . buckling system bit inconvenient - you really get your head down there put strap just right get side thingy snapped . i wish our son could buckle himself this point , but this seat makes it too hard . it also not seat you want air travel , it unwieldy carry around . but , all all i would say it good purchase	-1
i originally bought this bag trip disney world . it held everything great , stayed place less cumbersome than full backpack . although i not using it carry children gear , i carried umbrella , 3 bottles water , granola bars , sun glasses , cellphone , keys , wallet baseball hat small souvenirs it always stayed put fit great ! i am looking forward using bag diaper bag , it held up wonderfully vacation bag so far	1
i always graco infant seats my children . i got this one baby number 4 love it . it so cute ! cover just wonderful fall winter months . also , i love color it .	1
these wall hangings lovely . different textures very cool . maybe mine different than everyone elses , but they came little ribbon loops back , i don't get why there issue hanging them . they're very very cute , look adorable room .	1
i already single jogging stroller ( not bob ) happy it . we process adopting our second child , which we less than 24 hours notice , so lot money going legal costs , baby stuff , my time off work , result i concerned spending this much stroller , but worth every cent . bob duallie , i am ecstatic , overjoyed , delighted , thrilled looking forward my next trip out . my first trip out , i put my 2 year old 11 week old went six mile walk . trip so smooth , both kids slept most time . seats recline enough so my baby nearly flat , no problems his head bobbing around ( pardon pun ) . shocks give this stroller incredibly smooth ride , which transits less work my arms . i didn't realize how much effort went into other stroller , pushing it turning it . smooth ride also allowed us walk faster , plus when trying lose weigh t.t he stroller turn circles itself , allowing extremely sharp turns . very nice , especially when inside small store , like starbucks . windows up top well placed enough i actually see my kid face , not just their little bodies . straps easiest adjust any stroller i've used . there extra padding shoulder straps cushion kid shoulders . straps waist don't come out sides , ( this kinda hard explain ) strap attached center seat , sides come around child , more like belt allowing snugger fit . even my 70 year old mother great time pushing stroller . mesa orange , it more like burnt orange , brown trim i am very glad i got it ! it not all like neon orange it appears some photos . sure get tray , i forgot order it stroller . storage little shallow , but double wide , there still plenty room stuff .	1
i return work after my second daughter born no place pump . i bought this pumped my car several months . great	1
this excellent product . it such good idea given many warnings out sids . i felt reassured night our child would able breathe if she happened roll sides or ends crib ... she wouldn't get her arms or legs stuck slats . i expecting fabric would white cotton ... happily surprised it made white satin material . we even family members thought someone made cribshield us .	1
it works fantastically purposes we purchased it !! sometimes there little interference , but if you just move monitor ( sometimes moving it even just couple inches left or right make difference ) it work great ! we no problems whatsoever we would definitely buy this monitor again !! night vision works great , even our son dark room . color great long there sufficient light .	1
i actually put this my daughter wish list then broke down bought it myself her because i just couldn't wait see if she'd get it her 1st birthday . i always take tubbies my daughter so i like fun toys tubby i enjoy too . my daughter loves her out-of-water xylophone thinks this one pretty neat too - i admit i play it more than she this point . she only 9-1/2 months right now so i think she gets bit older she'll enjoy it more . my only complaint , reason i didn't give it 5 stars , it should come more play sheets they not waterproof . other than , fun toy . after i got this , i find it target same price it listed here no sh charges but still don't regret getting it .	-1
even though this costs bit more , its worth every penny ! it so easy put buggy ! my son comfy fits it very well !	1
it great manual pump , but it just manual pump after all . manually pumping both breasts one time takes more than twice long double electric pumping get same amounts milk . it would impossible me keep pumping work if i take much time out every work day . however i keep this pump my desk drawer emergencies ( like time i forgot my other pump home ) or out-of-office meetings ( because it small discrete ) . it also great occasional home use or women who need leave house pump every once while . i'm giving it 4 stars because i don't think it should advertized use full time job	1
these cloths awesome . they smell great don't crumble like other brands . they work well forsponge baths when there no time real bath ! love them	1
this our first only child seat worked quite well us . we need put specialized cushon our baby head . there recent articles warning against letting your baby sleep child seat sine babies ' head muscles aren't very strong , support good addition . i find triangle grip excellent but even small baby seat , you not want cary this very far all . my wife fact back injury carying our son this seat just car our house ! some day , these seats may come some other innovation making them more ergonomic parents . i don't know it would different seat , but warned , these things not meant actually carry child hand women weakened muscles after giving birth . it terrible combination . carying baby this seat should task husbands several months i found out too late . back seat , it works quite well car baby trend snap-n-go . we use snap-n-go quite often it prevents you repeatedly removing your child seat snapping him back ( which trying you your kid ) . i disappointed unit no spf rating sun shade . feature may not made it child seats but sun protection extremely important babies it wouldn't difficult use protective fabric . i called baby trend they no idea if how well shade actually blocked harmful uv rays . other seats may not this feature either but we look closely it future after sternly warned child safety class hospital . babies super sensitive skin it important avoid any direct sunlight if possible . i know it sounds extreme alarmist but it also should very easy recommended american adadamy pediatrics ([...]) . now , you would need additional cover top included cover . pros : consumer report top pick , not expensive somecons : no spf rating or sun uv protection listed sun shade . heavy non ergonimic cary hand ( not complaint specific this particular seat , they probably all )	-1
i diehard graco fan . when my daughter born 2002 graco snugride top rated infant seat ( i put lot stock into what consumer reports say ) . infant seat great we got it part travel system . i loved both stroller seat , very sad when she outgrew seat around 1 years old . i tried eddie bauer convertible seat next it horrible , straps always twisted my daughter head always fell forward onto her chest when she fell asleep . i quickly changed graco comfortsport ( one overhead drop down bar ) she loved it . it more padding , her head rested side carseat instead her chest straps never twisted . it easy get out not too heavy lug around airports . when she outgrew seat i decided make switch britax . although roundabout rate #1 cr i went marathon because only thing cr didn't like it infant latch ( which i wouldn't need my child 3yrs old ) it higher weight limit than roundabout . i own honda accord 4 door my husband drives 4 door toyota echo ( tiny ) . seat fits perfectly well both vehicles forward facing position . toyota latch honda doesn't but both cars it doesn't move . partly due fact my husband excellent installing partly due car seats weight . it quite heavy , it pain haul around airports . my husband usually just loosens straps wears it like backpack through airport . my daughter loves it , ( we girly print , not granite ) it plenty room her , she never uncomfortable sleeping it ( her head doesn't sit her chest either ) , though she very bright 4 year old she never able get out seat . i love fact she it until she 65lbs five point restraint straps never twist . britax also thoughtful things like adding velcro sides seat hold straps place when you're putting your child padded area under clip so your child isn't burned hot plastic summer ( or freezing winter ) . i plan staying britax here out	1
love it , it must our babies room , but only drawback our wipe warmer ( lion heart 2004 model ) not fit correctly . fix this we just taped down wipe warmer . i love everything you need placed diaper depot so easy grab one handed course . note : we not use bottom basket under wipe warmer diaper storage but instead cloth towel holder it works great , especially if you boy need alittle protection and/or clean up showers ! also our diaper stacker holds more adds decor nursery them	-1

we bought this swing just under year ago , when our baby two months old . she loved this swing either asleep it , or just peacefully playing looking around room us . now she 14 months not used it awhile , so two months ago friends bought it us their newborn son . they used it only two months , when one day they turned it off smoke started coming out motor compartment . batteries intact , but swing didn't work whatsoever anymore , even new batteries . i called fisher price , they very concerned smoke . i didn't purchase receipt anymore , wasn't sure if it still covered warranty . they asked product code run code , where i bought it ( babies us ) . they now sending me brand new motor housing ( entire top portion swing , which you just attach legs ) . they also sending pre-paid label put box , so i send them dead motor housing . how great ! i am so impressed amazed fisher price customer service . no receipt , still they totally helping me out basically replacing swing . talk gaining customer loyalty ! it good know you pay $130 baby item get your money worth all around . swing itself just wonderful . motor quiet , my baby loved moving bugs , two swinging directions offers nice change baby . swing colors great well , soothing neutral , instead usual super bright primary colors most other swings	1
i sent this baby shower gift it used right away . new parent loved it praised great smell	1
i completely understand your concern . although , if you read instructions any mobile , when child old enough sit or stand crib ( around 6 months ) , you supposed take it off . they not built anyone play them . my son liked his mobile so much when he old enough reach it , we took it off my husband attached it top his hutch . this way we still able play song , but he couldn't reach it . i think this mobile perfect way add room theme . those who looking buy this mobile , or any other mobile : go store where you buying your crib , try it out . people babies us must thought i nuts , because i took quilt mobile set i wanted took them crib i buying . i able determine if mobile would fit before i bought it , i got see how colors bedding looked color crib . this eliminated lot hassle me later taking mobile back if it didn't fit	1

my baby just turned four months when i ordered this walker february . although pediatrician recommended no walkers this age , i used my judgement decided since our home one level , i am home all day , i could watch my baby safely while he walker . when walker arrived , i read instructions assembled walker 20 minutes . i place him walker used some baby blankets help prop his trunk muscles so he could sit upright . he didn't cry this all new him . i pushed , pulled him until he told me he tired . he now five months propel himself backwards side side small steps . he hasn't moved forward too much , but course change . short , this walker safe , durable resonable priced . colors rocket shape bit funky retro . i remove two items off " control panel " , two arched movable toys , because it too much . nice thing well control panel comes off completely reveal tray . seat also easily detaches just throw it washer/dryer . rest walker cleaned wiping soap water . there three height level adjustments walker . walker collapes storage . summerize , i would definately recommend this walker , it durablility , practicality increase motor skills , perception baby	1

i recently purchased this potty my 16 month old son . we not actively training but i wanted introduce him it . first night i got it , he went pee pee boo boo it . i screamed clapped sang little song . he really likes it . he even brought it out bathroom took it into living room watch wiggles while sitting it . i like color , how it fits his size(he 27lbs 32 inches tall ) . he sit it get up all himself . its very sturdy , it doesn't wobble or tip over like some . my son even held onto one sides ( while sitting it ) leaned over pick up one his books potty didn't tip all . one reviewer said splashguard little short , but i haven't problem . my son tends look down himself while he going , so everything pointing south anyway . i love there only 2 pieces this chair . very easy clean . i safety 1st chair flip top lid detachable splashguard i absolutely hated this thing . my son would pull off splashguard walk around house it . he too concerned lid turning around chair pull lid up down instead concentrating trying go potty . baby bjorn there no distractions , no music , no removable pieces(except bowl)which allows him focus going potty . i just really like this potty chair . i would highly recommend this chair	1
my son now 18 months old . i used this product time he born until he 10 months old started using sippy cups . i don't know what i would without it . my husband deployed boiling bottles takes tons time . my dishwasher sanitizing cycle , but when i used it bottles nipples would still film them . sterilizer kept them looking new . i also felt better knowing they through sterilizing process microwave . if you want use your dishwasher , i would still recommend using this , it not take much time all . i used it medula pump parts gerber bottles , even tall 9 oz bottles would fit if you put them right . i would highly recommend this anyone baby , it one few products i actually used regular basis	1
i gave this exersaucer 5 stars because it keeps my baby interested so i housework . we took our 3 month old daughter store tried out each one see her reaction . 5 months now , she able pull everything her own without any assistance me . we think it great building strength her legs . my froggie doesn't croak like other user mentioned , but everything else same . i am very pleased our purchase , which good considering it most expensive one	1
i bought this after reading other amazon reviews . i love this jumperoo . i put my daughter this when she almost four months old ( she great neck control ) . although she couldn't reach floor ( pillow worked great underneath her ) she immediately started play toys turn around seat . few days later she jumping fool . she smiles laughs this thing . watch out really messy diapers , poop jumps right up back front	1
overall this good gate . i use it puppy , so it much more different experience me than using it " baby gate " . intstalation easy . first i thought gate broken becuase latch didn't meet upper end stuck out farther than lower ends . this supposed way . i just want make clear . when you fasten it wall , pressure pushes top together so it latch . use product litlle hard . latch requires you push two buttons ( pinch them your index thumb ) pull it side ( left or right depending few things ) while holding buttons . pushing it forward or towards you . it sounds hard . first . but you'll get hang it . using 2 hands if you makes it easier . quality product great . it withstood lot . but keep mind i 5 pund puppy not 10+ pound child . one other thing i must note there bar bottom touches floor . it very easy trip over . when you , it hurts . don't let this factor alone deter you buying this gate . it good relativly inexpensive product one only decent pressure mount gates out there i could find	-1
this great booster seat . we bought one 5 years ago used it both kids . it folds up nice durable easy clean . we used take it camping us strap it picnic tables . best booster seat we ever tried	1
well , i can't give them too bad review since this only pacifier my son take . however , i can't give it all five stars either ... one , this pacifier really bulky compared other pacifiers . it almost looks like nipple you would put bottle ... it bulky . second , there attatcher attatches pacifier clips baby cloths so pacifier doesn't fall floor , even more bulkier than pacifier . so using two them your baby almost consumed this pacifier . i guess my biggest beef this pacifier more cosmitically . it ugly pacifier . besides it ugly , it pretty good pacifier . i like my son didn't problem nipple confusion due using this . moment he born he just high need suck i just couldn't spare my breast whole entire day , so we give him pacifier . he never problem using this pacifier then nursing me .	-1
i many stroller over span last 7 years 3 children this best one yet . so easy push isn't so wide you can't fit through doorway but wide enough so kids don't fight . my oldest even jumps front wheel cover ( i know he shouldn't but what you going ) i comfortably push all three . love it . love it . love it . get this stroller if you looking one	1

bed great . took while put together but absolutely no problems it . my wife who weights 125 lbs laid this bed it not even come close falling apart . it states max weight should 50 lbs but it appears handle more than double . my daughter loves it i recommend it if you dont mind time it takes put together . sure it bit tricky but i believe way poles made it more support . loved fact i could use mattress her crib .	1
my husband i bought this because our baby born right before we would moving back us . we very happy it it makes traveling baby breeze . we never worry if hotel we're provides cribs , or if they safe matter . we it almost three months now , using it exclusivly , only thing wrong small tear fabric . i no trouble setting this up , however i try it out before baby came so i wasn't exhausted time . i don't think it would gone same if i . i can't imagine what we would without this thing	1
i absolutely love this monitor . if i recommend only one baby item , it would this . 2.5 months , monitor gone off twice . i no idea if they false alarms or not , because time i sprinted her crib , she already startled out her deep sleep beeping monitor , which i like . even though she healthy , full-term baby 9 both her apgars non-smoker household risk sids low her , i great peace mind knowing her breathing monitored all times	1
i ordered safari comforter , dust ruffle , sheets ( yellow green ! ) , rugs , fleece blankets animals corners , bumper pads my boys ' room - it all so cute !!! it restful fun same time . i love you order only parts you need . only one my boys needed bumper pads , but both needed everything else . i hard time finding place where i could get comforter dust ruffle without bumper pads . i prefer yellow sheets over lime green . we lots guests , everyone comments how cute boys ' room , but even better boys love it	1

while my son still riding rear facing car , he would often lose his pacifier . without pacifier keeper , it next impossible locate . i trouble searching around carseat because i could not see where reach . i found this pacifier keeper useful because i always knew spencer pacifier near . now trips car less stressful . he even big enough find it himself ! i never worry it fallen floor car , either . what great idea	1
this dish best - especially if your child sitter all . you prepare meals hot dish cold fruit kept seperate during heating . i am getting several more our second baby	1
our son born middle september . during first day we definitely problems . day after him my lactation consultant suggested these hubby ran babysrus buy these . i wore them hr before feeding time our son truly fed 1st time able stay latched entire 40mins he took . they effective immediately these such godsend . you dont worry nipple confusion etc you might shield , previous review right , most time i would easily forget they there would check make sure . also they not noticeable under clothing so you wear these anywhere . i also wore these when i leakage problems i never worry leaking through my clothes public or something . our son now 4mnths old i havent use these since he 2mnths old . i'm saving these any future kids ours i recommend them anyone inverted or flat nipples	1
i purchased stroller sight unseen , no one around here it stock yet . i 20 month old 7 month old . yes , it still heavy , but graco never claimed it lighter , just more compact , so i just figure it help tone my arms up ! it gets around great ! only two things i found i would change stroller 1 ) cupholders small diameter not accomodate most my sons sippy cups .... 2 ) i hard time lowering cargo basket , maybe its just my model ? i received stroller brake shattered , but called graco they immediately sent replacement free charge .... great cust service . i'd spend money again	-1
removable cover ( zipper ) make this easy clean ( just make sure velcro stuck itself when you wash it or it stick all your nice socks . my wife tried boppy first month then got this , which she used continually next six . you even use it standing up or when you move around since strap goes around your back . strap also provides back support . pocket nice touch ( you put your lansinoh it ) only possible downside it isn't easy put one hand ( if you already cradling baby	1
cosleeper must ! it works stand alone bassinet well i put it close my bed one side open when baby wakes i don't get up - very convenient	1
i usually write very long reviews but i think i cut this one short ! other step stools skid around , too brightly colored too short ! my 3 y.o b/g twins used this since they 18 months old . they use it getting sink , get potty , reach something up high , get chairs eat , deven get into bed sometimes ! they love them . stools very sturdy i recomend them anyone , whether you kids or not , it holds almost any weight very convinient perfect height . we one each bathroom , one upstairs hall closet one cabinet under kitchen sink , ( or under table lol ) . means we 4 these stools . they very simple use i even use them sit when i wash my younger babies . i plan these around years . they great , clean blend perfectly into any room . buy them , they dont skid great any age	1
i initially bought rainforest bouncer but wasn't too happy it . hanging toys hung way too low made hard plastic . my baby got his foot stuck them . i returned it this one my baby boy loves it . he smiled immediately puppy when i turned it watched it entire time then went sleep . i actually liked idea this bouncer because puppy more upbeat rather than soothing like other bouncers so my baby gets some playtime . time he gets tired , puppy music shuts off he sleeps peacefully vibrating chair . my only minor complaint i wish ball toy bar cracked or squeaked . but overall , terrific purchase !	1
i love this lamp shade . it really cute matches perfectly everything ! cost high just shade , but worth it	-1

i given this walker friend who child progressed so fast he skipped walker stage . when i brought it home my son instantally fell love it shear fact he could move around pretty freely he really enjoys it . it little basic design i found toys not stay put very long they not made very well very basic . my main problem this walker it pain butt put away it doesn't fold up easily it doesn't stay folded very long . i also am problems ajusting height walker my friend put it all way down now i can't get it go back up so my son basically standing all himself when he it ( which i am not complaining )	-1
i ordered this monitor listen my mother who unable get around because i am unable sit her every moment . i wanted able some freedom roam around room able listen her case she needed me . monitor wasn't expensive , so i wasn't expecting much . i pleasantly surprised this monitor picks up every noise room . there also clip so you attatch it yourself not contained one room house . it either plugged or ran batteries . i couldn't more pleased monitor . i would recommend it because it worth every cent	1
my son 7 months old just started sitting high chairs restaurants shopping carts . so far , clean shopper working pretty well us . fabric thick , so it doesn't make tiny package . it also doesn't fold up neatly , so you kind just wad it up . it isn't cushioned , but if it it would huge , i enough issue trying carry my son , cart cover , my purse , whatever else i might need . besides , he doesn't really need cushioning . even 7 months , he perfectly comfy thick bedspread-like fabric . clean shopper comes thick plastic bag ( sort thing bedspreads or other linens come ) zips closed . it snug fit get there because wadded nature bundle , but it works fine . handle short taut , so isn't much use . longer strap so it could shoulder worn or hung stroller would better . loops work well , it relief clean place my son sit play anchored toys . he can't throw toys floor , he stays entertained . there velcro tabs front fastened around front shopping cart or high chair . this keeps it place better . leg holes don't match up exactly whatever he sitting , but it doesn't cause problem . my main problem clean shopper belt strap not attach seat . it completely seperate piece . unless you careful snap belt clips together , looping belt around part seat , you end up losing strap . somehow i've lost mine after only few uses . i kept it rolled up inside thing when i removed it cart , it probably fell out parking lot somewhere . when handling baby , your purse , whatever your cart ( or trying eat restaurant ) , it very easy overlook such small item . since website sells replacement straps , it seems they aware issue . it shame they don't velcro tabs stick it back shopper , making it harder lose strap . i've ordered two replacements black , so i see strap more clearly against my blue clean shopper . i also make certain i buckle strap clips . it good seat cover overall , definitely worth . just careful strap	-1
hamper very sturdy . it also large enough hold quite lot clothes . i would highly recommend it .	1
i started out different shopping cart cover i bought grocery store . it worked ok , but it didn't work all costco because carts extra wide . i bought floppy seat it works like charm . it only one i've found that wide enough costco sam club carts . , it fluffy , comfy , easy use . regarding one reviewer comment - yes , you feed strap through back - but every shopping cart cover out there requires you . i can't get it one hand , but it big enough i put it seat , put my son seat , then get it perfectly situated once he sitting strapped . my only complaint it pretty big , but if it smaller it probably wouldn't fit big carts - which why i like it so much first place . plus , it covers every inch so my very curious son can't find random shopping cart or highchair spots suck	1
this set great my daughter loved it since shes doras fan everything . i love sheets they soft great if anything spills it it easy clean just perfect . i got this set kids 29.99 but amazon price i say its worth it . its great buy .	1
we brought this seat daughter when she out grew her infant seat . i think we paid $35.00 wal mart it . it lasted her two years then we used it oru son year until plastic seat(where you hook up harness broke . it also easy clean . alothough taking off cover little tricky	-1
i love how easy this stroller use , way it looks , way it handles drives , most importantly my son loves ride it ! i say " nearly perfect " only because i wish it reclined . but this doesn't seem prevent my son pleasant nap it .... i just think he'd more comfortable if it reclined . i'd keep everything else it same , i would definitely recommend this stroller someone who travels her child much i ( once month least )	-1
if you're concerned plastic bottles , this excellent alternative . too bad it hard find them retail stores . it should promoted more , no babies should drinking out plastic bottles leach toxic chemicals anyway .	1
i bought this stroller my baby girl i haven't used it yet my wife due month now but everything came perfect conditions no broken pieces also i got it $130.00 60% off good deal , i don't know how it using it streets but i come back share my experience .	-1
i contemporary home . front stairs second floor slotted w/spaces plus metal tubular hand rails spaces landing same hand rail . we moved when my children much older . suddenly , i two year old grandchild one way . i panicked . what safety . glass or pexiglass would taken too long install very costly . suddenly i saw ad railnet . while it probably easier put it straight opening , we successful figuring out how string netting angle . i feel so much better knowing children not able fall through railing . we plan putting one under stair slats well . i highly recommend this product . it inexpensive , simple strong .	1
i love this bumper . only reason i got this begin because when i removed old traditional fluffy cotton bumper pads , which i realized weren't safe , my 4 month old would squirm around , his legs or arm would end up sticking out slats he would get stuck . so i realized i needed something block slats . i happy find this new breathable bumper keep his arms legs crib . my only concern whether or not i'd able easily change crib sheet once this installed . i ! my husband secured this bumper ( velcro pads ) extremely tight all way around . spend few extra minutes ( it takes 2 people ) then you not remove bumper get sheets off ! i even completely pull mattress out crib get sheets off easier if i need , bumper stays place since it fits so snugly against sides crib . it almost like it not even there . i highly recommend this product	1
i carried my first child everywhere this . she didn't care stroller who would ? hip hammock she carried around , able see everything eye level ( instead looking everyone knees ) close mommy ( or daddy ) got cuddled constantly . i would walk mall hours her there , she slept it i could sit down her it rest or even feed her . i loved i never needed take it off , but even when i it so simple ! trick getting it fit well make sure waist strap very snug child should slightly front your hip , not actually side . i put my girl , make sure she evenly positioned middle " seat " then pull her closely me while adjusting shoulder strap . you pull it nice tight , but not so tight it rides up your neck . i recommend trying it home first getting it just how you like i t-t hen only undo front strap take it off . otherwise you pull front back when you're " out " that difficult . i found best positioning baby mom baby back arm under mother arm which then draped over child back then easily " hold " bottom hammock or just hang free . i found i didn't actually " hold " my daughter while she hammock . my big complaint strap gets twisted padding eventually there no fixing it . i wish they would put non slip gripper bottom strap so it doesn't slip toward your neck . i think this would fix bunching padding happens . however , i loved this thing so much i'm just going buy new one my second child . i know i get my money worth ! it saves my back shoulders . i tried front carriers just can't stand them more than 15 minutes .

this made really well protects baby well also seems very comfortable . it also easy carry all our stuff , especially when out all day . it great walking because it steers really well very smooth . but , shopping stores it difficult maneuver down narrow aisles because it wide . i picked this over metrolite because other seemed too wobbly . it bit heavy lift car , but i am strong , so this isn't major issue , but my mom could barely lift it into car . my daughter also slept stroller fully reclined , which awesome doing yard work summer . we even taken this beach loaded everything into bottom over handles , there so much storage space below . baby also well protected sun under awesome canopy . but , i switched lightweight narrow stroller taking my 21 month old daughter out longer trips since she doesn't always want sit it entire time .	-1
i gave seat itself 5 stars - i guess our car gets 3 stars :) seat wonderful - easy install , good latch fit , foot it level seat out , nice lining . unfortunately , we going return it get seat our soon-due newborn ! it too long ( head foot ) fit comfortably our car . we don't center latch points , so it go behind seat . car seat so long , once it installed appropriate level newborn , seat front it almost completely upright pushed forward more than comfortable 5'7 " person . reference , we 2003 subaru forester . before you buy this seat , see if you find friend one ... check it out your car make sure it fits ! i didn't expect it problem - it wasn't our first child seat smaller . so , benefit this carseat ( rear facing 30 lbs ! ) could it downfall you if you don't large vehicle	1
