product average ... ours button whole sewed so tight even i problems buttoning ... impossible my 20 month old . it says clothes remove fully easily ... which i thought would great my daughter since she likes try dress things ... but pullover removed pulling over head it isn't easy ... again almost impossible little one . also ... ours didn't come back pack which i'm sure would made toy more fun ! perhaps she'll gain interest capability toy months come ... but right now ... she much interest it she say ... carpet	1
we bought this dollhouse , because when we went store , it adorable display looked like step up twintime dollhouse , which very small rooms . you could press button display , people would talk each other . my kids thought it would great . when we toys us , i looked accessory furniture/people/animal sets go this dollhouse . i not see any . i thought it probably due christmas just passed . we got home , opened dollhouse discovered there really not many phrases provided people/furnitureanimal , so i went amazon try find more sets order achieve purpose this dollhouse ( get 200 phrases ) . thats when reality set we just made huge mistake . you cannot find any accesory pieces this set . you go ebay pay many times more than original price used furniture . i really disappointed . i even tried fisher price website , only find they marketing twintime dollhouse furniture this sweet sounds dollhouse . what shame sham .... i really like fisher price toys we many , but i am very disappointed fact they trying fool consumer . what good dollhouse , if you cannot get it accomplish what it says it --- 200 phrases . not mention , what included sweet sounds dollhouse not much . just mom , dad , girl , baby , swing , cradle , radio , cat , scant few more pieces . definately not enough keep kids interested long ! there actually three fisher price dollhouses still available , this one , twintime dollhouse , one we eventually ended up buying value city ( also available ebay) -- fisher price special edition townhouse . it doorbell rings , doors open , birds sing , phone rings , lights come , fridge light comes , computer lights up(and part desk set attached dollhouse ) , fireplace crackles lights up ( which also attached dollhouse ) . these things all dollhouse itself . no accesory furniture or people needed make this happen . battery replacement compartment back this dollhouse not bottom , like sweet sounds one . front townhouse flower boxes likelike flowers you place them ( comes set ) . you get it lot cheaper than sweet sounds dollhouse , too ( almost half cost ) . it comes great deal furniture : 2 beds pillows comforters blankets , lawnchair , 3 people , potted plant , real curtains , kitchen table chairs , clothing people , computer chair , lounge chair more . kitchen counter , stove , microwave fridge part dollhouse . it also closet doors open stairs people walk up . you practically not need buy anything else , but if you , you get loving family accesory people furniture sets . this dollhouse so much larger boot . there plenty room put everything . it shuts closes together just like sweet sounds , but it clearly larger . we also thought twintime , but it too many comments how small rooms display toys us looked jammed packed . i not know how more than one child could play it not shoving match , because they could not play , well . my kids absolutely townhouse all its sounds , especially doorbell . great thing it these greatly reduced price , because they older model , which what they should sweet sounds dollhouse . let public know ahead time , so their kids not get disappointed , because it not live up what it says store . thank goodness i able take mine back , because i my receipt box . careful keep box receipt if you choose buy this dollhouse even after all warnings , because after your kids see it not what it says because it small side compared townhouse version , they may not want keep it . when we took ours back , toys us worker stopped talked us agreed fisher price just trying get rid their extra stock sweet sounds dollhouses . unfortunately , it consumers expense disappointment !!	1
i am very disappointed this produc t.t he volume not adjustable , default sound setting so loud it heard room , even door closed . electronic toy voices occasionally annoying or difficult understand , this case here . so , needing something repeated ... loudly ... " get your nerves " . i more careful future not assume all speaking electronic toys come adjustable volume . buyers beware !	-1
like many overhead gym type toys , this one turns out short or legless babies . when my daughter kicks kickplates , she kicks toy right away her ( this carpet ) , when we brace toy against something , she kicks herself right out under toy . we found same true number similarly designed toys . now we looked box more closely , baby picture his/her legs bent really hard order baby fit under toy . our daughter 3 1/2 months old already too big this . positive note , this very well made toy all other respects . looks durable , all chicco toys , music lights pleasant . negative : you apparently push two hanging toys get them activate sound lights , most babies want pull them . might good tummy toy , but we're not waiting that--we'll try chicco 3 1 gym instead , it appears much better bang buck not kick plate	1

i purchased this my 2 boys , 5 3 , february . got it clearance walmart $19 , but would not wanted spend much more it . i debated whether get this or kitchen made cooking sounds but didn't speak 3 languages , since we're trying raise our children bilingual ( least ! ) we thought talking kitchen would preferable . unfortunately , voices hard understand - not they're soft , but there seems lot mumbling static , so if you don't know exactly what voice saying already , you wouldn't able learn , example , spanish word bacon " tocino " - it sounds more like " poseena " . beyond , however , both boys enjoyed it . it little small 5-yr old now but they both still play it . they occasionally get frustrated only cookie sheet fit into oven ( you can't put pot or nearly any other cooking vessel our other playsets ) . reason this obvious- sensor talking feature top oven , thus order close enough food sensor respond whatever there , floor oven raised rather high . if i it again , i would probably look kitchen set only cooking sounds not talking feature , it just not used often this house .	1

my oldest daughter got older version this product her 5th birthday . she could only play couple games time , but she loved it . three years now it her all-time favorite car toy . it dropped , banged , kicked , stepped , fought over , everything else two kids could it 3 years , still works great ! drawbacks : pixter leapster caught kids might actually want play their toys past 5pm car put lcd lighting , but this company hasn't caught yet . also , no headphones jack -- some games make incredibly annoying noises ! one more thing -- ages not appropriately labeled . closer first grade up	1

i would rated this lower , but idea so great . my 7yo loves his book . careful w/ pages you submit . we ordered two books first book contains original submitted pages w/ artwork ( except cover which scanned reprinted " glossy " paper ) . 2nd book , course , all photocopied pages firs t.t hey simply take your submitted artwork pages someone ( or possibly ocr ) , prints your submitted text just under your drawings ; then binds pages into book , title page , dedication page , etc . not sturdy book i thought it should , but i said , my kid loves it , so that what matters most . lt ; grin	1
my daughter got this birthday gift really likes playing it . she loves palying animals this perfect fit doll house she recieved christmas . she still playing it several months later	1
box said it came 10 refillable paint containers , but ours only 9 bottles , one those empty . no matter , really , it just small amount paint start , but why not give people what you tell them you ? color selection all right , but not super - you don't get roygbiv or anything . it may vary , course , but we lot light green . some them glitter , which extra cool good job making whole picture sparkle if you add it last . it also comes small assortment ( 40 pieces ) paper -- both large small sizes -- which you encouraged reserve last one template trace make new ones . poster board seems same thickness original paper . smaller " bonus " machine go fast if you pump button down repeatedly . doing this , it actually go faster than battery operated one paint distributes spatters very well . instruction manual , if you call it , pretty limited . it shows 3 pictures how put everything together operate it . no tips or hints how make neat designs . it least detailed set instructions i seen art toy . it comes apart easy rinsing/wiping . i've always this immediately after paint session , units still clean they first time out box . my kids love it . they want spin pictures every day	1

we bought game thinking it would just like real life game , but sponge bob characters . it very simplified version game . it geared towards young children . game , if you run out money , you just keep playing , you exempt pay any fees , while people money , still keep paying ... so you actually better off if you lose your money early game . ( bugs me)as far spinner goes ... it snaps , you press hard get it click into place , it works great . just little disappointed , just remember , it little kids . if you love game life , get original one ... my older kids want me buy original one , they don't care sponge bob version .	1
this puzzle great , i'm glad i bought it my 2 year old , claire . however , like most toddlers , she prefers things her size . i find hands this puzzle slim adult sized hands , like my own . maybe makers felt " mommy " sized hands way go , or simply they wanted fill space standard sized wooden puzzle . i think it would nice make hands toddler sized , chubby palms fingers . said , it great tool . we don't use it much counting , though it intent . this more prop song fest " where thumbkin " even more exciting prop game " dr. claire " wherein she repairs " owie hand " . all all , fine addition your wooden puzzle collection	1
i bought this my 8 11 year old girls extre inexpensive christmas gift , i pleasently surprised how much they enjoy it	1
my twin boys ( 16 months ) love this toy . i would suggest getting least 100 extra balls . ( i 250 our ball pit it really looks fun )) connections aren't best , but they work better than other company models don't velcro straps . our kids play this off most day . cautionary note , this fairly large system tunnels tents so make sure you plenty room . course , you use pieces separately make several smaller play spaces instead one large area . overall , i am glad i purchased this i didn't wait until recommended 3 year old age range .	1
i bought this computer my just turned 5 year old . while he thinks it really cool , it bit hard him . 26 games , he play 6 . i am happy it toy he grow it teach him lot . graphics great but i wish volume could turned down one more setting . i wish there setting they could just type letters learn keypad . all all , good investment .	1

shopping puzzles over last few years i've noticed manufacture age recommendations seem bit off . when puzzles too advanced , simple solution put it up later date ; however , when they too simple , they're waste money . unfortunately , alphabet art puzzle one those disappointments . puzzle encourages thinking , matching , but i'm not sure it helped teach alphabet . addition , some images too goofy this age group . instance , piece rope shaped into letter " , " but 3-year old don't associate such thing . example this , letter " " yarn . wouldn't yo yo better solution ? raised pieces offer new motor challenge plastic knobs , but they too shallow board . i can't seem move this puzzle without dropping several pieces floor . my son found this frustrating well . what more , i think age recommendation needs adjusted . i purchased alphabet art puzzle when my son 2-years 4-months old . it recommended children 3-years up , so i thought it would make good choice . it didn't challenge him all . second time he worked it , he completed it less than 4-minutes himself . said , my son benefited puzzle . he likes working it , continues ask questions pictures . i recommend it children 18-months up , they find it more challenging than 3-year old .	1

if you your friends just too crazy conventional board games , give i've never - game truth try . object game simple , players move around board answering highly personal potentially defamatory questions , take shots or drink beer while playing . questions formatted " i've never .... " ( example , " i've never skinny-dipping " ) . if this true you , you get move forward designated number spaces . if it false , you pay consequence ( generally you must take drink ) . some spaces game board automatically force you drink . many people find questions far too offensive overly personal , uncomfortable playing this game . if this you , don't feel bad , you're not only one . however , group close friends , this game total laugh riot . this game perfect bachelor or bachelorette party , or just regular party group friends who crazy you	1
i bought this my 5 year old daughter we tried take very good care it . within few days careful use , one latches bent , hinge broke off piece edge came unglued . it great idea , but needs better construction . positive note , my daughter loved it would spent hours drawing creating tools inside if i let her . however , i take box away so further damage not occur before i fix it . drawers work fine . problem two doors top flip out . note drawers ; little plastic door knobs pop out . need glued .	-1

this extremely fun addictive game . you shuffle cards , place three ( room , weapon , person ) secret envelope . every room you go into , you make accusations . if someone card you accused ( like room ) , then they show it you you write it down your notepad . game changes constantly , so it never gets boring . character pieces teeny details , like mr. green straps buckles his briefcase . i gave it 4 stars education because it teaches you focus really think . oh , good problem-solving skills too . coordination ( you add all clues up see who it ) . all all , terrific game . great rainy days or playdates . i mention weapons ? very realistic . cute	1

this house great ! adorable beautiful . it even looks good my daughter room . i think it difficult get furniture during after holidays but now they easy get . my sister bought house my 2 1/2 year old daughter , peyton . she also bought all furniture her except nursery because she two cradles highchair there no more room room , family room , because they living room already . two chairs came house breakfast bar also came house . they aren't dining chairs . i think they just gave little furniture because they obviously want you spend money purchase more . yes rooms small . i wish they bigger too , but i don't think my daughter notices so much . she just likes playing it . although i admit she uses my coffee table kitchen my ottoman parents ' room . furniture adorable ! lots cute fabric accessories ! i 9 month old so i put all small pieces away . i don't think my 2 year old would appreciate them much anyway . there some accessories tied furniture strings . good idea someone her age since i baby i'm glad . i cut those off her when she older so baby , if she cares enough then . we kitchen , bathroom , parents ' room , girl room , dining room , living room laundry room . i haven't taken out dining room laundry room yet because kids room where dining room should . there room downstairs laundry room but i think set seems little old my daughter . she doesn't know what laundry room because ours our basemen t.t his house can't really hold all furniture available unless you use " terraces " . i also bought blonde mommy ( babysitter , aunt or older sister ) because i wanted little girl it came se t.t he only other set i really want suv . i admit i am living vicariously through my daughter because i would loved this dollhouse when i little girl . i think that why my sister bought it her too!it beautiful house i think well worth money , especially since it wasn't my money ! lol . it probably not anyone older than ten years old . i see how it would frustrating them .	1

this toy lots fun . i like play it using my old gijoe toys . my favorite scenario sigmund freud kill off cobra commander , then take his place leader cobra : enemy . his cigar , he works really well evil villain . ( plus , he likes torture good guys they capture tying them up putting his cigar out their bare chest . ) it lots fun play . final battle usually takes place rug foot my bed ( which substitutes jungle ) , where snake-eyes challenges sigmund freud duel order avenge death duke all other joes . ( snake-eyes always only surviving joe left . ) sigmund freud then tries some ninja moves kick snake-eyes ' rear , but snake eyes beats crap out him . it finally ends snake eyes using his sword gut sigmund freud , his sword slowly slides out his bloody entrails . it really lot fun ! sometimes i transformer crossover universe , where megatron comes sigmund freud join him some plot obtain energy order build ultimate weapon take control universe . joes always go get help optimus prime , who always puts stop this plot just last minute , but not before his arm gets chopped off battle . ( i am actually missing optimus ' arm real life , so that why this always happens story . ) anyways , sigmund freud great fun whole family ! especially 10-year-olds ( above ) . buy it today	1

i really enjoyed seeing my 3 children enjoying this toy . all three under 5 years so this perfect fit . i said , fun kids . putting this together easier common sense than confusing instructions . this product made plastic semi durable springs . front end loader good my son carrying my daughters toys away them , but not feasible doing much good when outside . ( i mean , thats what tractors , playing dirt . ) tires not good grass , they slip not get grip . it becomes family pushing toy instead one driven chain . i say it fun children , i give it 5 stars fun . it around , durability wise , we see ..	1

i really like it , but it little too easy adults . not fast-paced they say , well . but , it still fun play ! cards cool look , but bit too slippery . somewhat hard shuffle control . overall though , nice card game .	1
what i say . this fantastic game . you know when you keep seeing movies often disappointed keep waiting blockbuster . well , wit end blockbuster . i can't tell you how much fun we playing this game . it trivia knowledge based game but twist . not only you challenged questions , but question types make game even more interesting . there four different card categories which ask different types questions . teaser category , asks you figure out relationship ; sequence category asks you put people , places things sequence ; odd-1-out category asks you decide which thing not belong wild card category many different types fun question types . if great categories where not enough , questions cover great range knowledge ; including pop culture , music , literature , geography , history ; science .... just everything ! better yet , there detailed answers every question . so you not just left one world answer , but explanation . you actually learn thing or two interesting facts details . questions smart ( real smart ! ) , not dumbdown version other trivia games . i cannot stress you how fantastic this game .... if you up challenge	1
my 8 year old daughter wanted this more than anything her birthday it absolutely everything she hoping . she loves able change password any time she wants gets huge kick out thinking she only one get into it ! ( it seem little-sister-proof ) it even tells her how many " intruders " tried open journal . pen radio gets few stations depending where she walking house - only downside radio i can't hear what she listening unless i'm always checking her . shredder pen manual tiny pieces paper only - which seems perfect whatever shredding 8 year old girl want . there way set journal easier get into - more sensitive setting really very sensitive - we reset password several times when it wouldn't recognize her password - but problem resolved when set less sensitive . ( easier mom get into without setting off intruder alert ....	1

this cute , easy game play . i bought this one my son few years ago it still big hit . it fun keeps him giggling . he asked play few times row , because it short adventure . i think if your little one scared monsters his room this helps ease his fear . when they happen pick monster out sack ... they say ~ go away monster pitch it into box ... i make up little things say when this happens . i highly recommend this game , not hard really you don't need directions ... explain it once they it . great buy	1

my son ( currently approaching 15 months ) totally obsessed cars trucks , pretty much time he old enough hold toy car his hand . even car ads tv drive him crazy joy . compulsive shopper , i buy him toy cars trucks all time . :) out all his toys , this set may his favorite . he loves zoom cars across floor ( they roll very easily , even carpet ) also take them apart put them together . it little hard pull first piece off when taking them apart , so his mom or i help him , but it ok -- he take second piece off put them back just fine . ( we sometimes use his other mega bloks put together big crazy vehicles using parts these three trucks -- it hard see picture , but each truck consists two top pieces chassis piece , all which connect up any other mega bloks . ) same token , they very sturdily put together . he course throws them drops them floor sometimes , because they hard plastic , they make very loud noise tile , but there hasn't so much hairline crack . i see them lasting until he outgrows them . set seem little expensive amount stuff you get ( we actually bought it much less discount store ) , but hindsight , my son loves this toy so much it so sturdily built it would worth retail price .	1
this teaches both color shape recognition , while fun toy bath . my son loves bath time , any time i make it fun learning time , it good thing .	1
my grandson polar express train expert . he very disappointed train didn't really look like movie train . he liked whistle , but very expensive whistle .	-1
you deal cards , show green apple card , everybody turns red apple card , hilarity ensues . each hand inspires discussion chuckles . i liked variations suggested instructions , such dealing all green ( adjective ) cards finding best match red ( noun ) card , or trying find least-fitting match , or just turning red card blindly before seeing what green card says . judge determine how play hand , my favorite part , decision judge completely arbitrary , meaning you pick whichever card you like . it easy , fun , game long or short you like . there lot shuffling involved , since you go through lot cards quickly , so someone hand who knows how shuffle deck cards . recommended	1
this item pretty cheap when you buy it target or any store good prices , but it eventually adds up more than it worth . each pvd $8.99 , but only holds 30 min . most ! i got this toy because hasbro.com made it look so cool , but it not worth it . i use it every now then but my dad doesn't spend lot money me there limits . after buying few pvds player , you could dvd player . dvds same price sometimes lower if it sale , hold lot more space . you also make dvds computer ! you make pvds but they hold under 20 min . i am not saying this toy horrible . if you child 8 or younger , video now xp might good way go . good thing it back each pvd , there now point . if you get six or more nowpoints , you get free pvd mail ! one good point it there long waranty . my first one didn't work very well so i got new one . although box you see two kids watching their videonow car , it not good idea unless it warm day . videonow xp sensitive cold could damaged if left cold too lond . think twice before you get it .	1

these cars so much fun ! just name says , you just shake it up it goes . my son several these they all slightly different reactions . some faster than others . they work best hard surface - cement , hardwood floors , tile . they go pretty slow carpet . cars very durable . one my son favorite games launch them off deck see if he get it land grass below . if weather isn't nice , he likes send them racing down stairs . so far , nothing broken its over six months . these cars easy my daughter ( who only two ) play too . kids love shaking cars racing see who car goes farthest .	1

i received this wagon second hand , i'm glad i didn't spend outrageous price charged it . yes , it relatively durable ( although ours literally fell apart under my 2 year old other day . nut holding wagon together worked itself loose our walk whole thing went pieces . replacing nut fixed problem ) , but it also tips easily . handle much too short . i've tie piece rope handle so i reach it without bending over . it really rough ride , my son never looks very comfortable it . all all , i think i'll passing it buying something else . maybe i'm just picky , but i'd rather pay quality , not radio flyer name . *** eta *** please excuse incorrect stars given this product . i'm not sure what happened . i meant give it 1 star , not 5	1

these babies so cute ! i suprised when i found bunch them yesterday local store same price other individual characters , now i wish i'd grabbed two sets , since they such huge hit ! one my kids little annoyed babies stay sitting - their legs don't move , but once convinced babies don't really walk all , she forgotten all fact . twins sit perfectly , don't topple over , plus they seem just perfect size . definantly great addition dora dollhouse character collection	1
i love melissa doug stuff -- well made , colorful toys always welcome my house . this puzzle perfect wee ones who manipulate floor puzzles like castles princesses like . however -- aware this actually 24-piece puzzle , not 48-piece puzzle . we two these , purchased hundreds miles apart , both 24 pieces , instead 48 listed both boxes	1
this game great sense just everyone play ! we pretty much scrapped rules it came with- they written inanely relatively useless . instead , we modify each game suit situation we're in- so we play it while waiting line disneyland while we're party . it great way " go back " all songs you didn't know you knew , marvel your friend talents ( or lack thereof ) mimic famous singers . if you get it nothing but word cards , it still totally worth it	1
i never one problem this monitor . it works great . occasionally ( once month ) you'll hear cb radio come over frequency second , but it doesn't wake baby or anything it gone quickly it came . i highly recommend this monitor	1
descriptions don't mention creepy voice says " it lullabye time " before it launches into seriously off-key rendition twinkle twinkle firefly ( huh ? there copyright problem using " little star " ? ) you press moon button skip first song , so i didn't too much trouble this- most songs after first mercifully without vocals . later this same robo-mom also says " i love you " , which seriously spooky . aside this , " amazing 3-d ceiling light " really more rotating circular slide projection some cartoon animals , bee-and- led light show actual toy looks really old-fashioned . nature sounds ok , but i am pretty sure one sounds " plank wood tapping against plank wood " . even all this , i still willing strap it my son crib see how he liked it- within first five minutes projector light flickered off , robo-mom got stuck kept saying " it lullabye time " over over .	-1
i happy give my 9 year old cousin game exercise her brain rather than barbie or video game . she learned rules first 5 minutes first game , just few snags ( trouble understanding discs must placed contigously . also occasional trouble understanding discs cannot flipped if they surrounded opponent disc indirect move ) . but point , she able play right away , eventually gain skills strategy . her dad teaching her play chess now , which all strategy but harder . othello good game playing same age while learning chess , because it easier but exercises same parts brain strategy thinking ahead .	1

please oh please not buy this item . my son interested engines i bought this show him how engine works . parts all listed correctly assembled picture looks interesting . assembly engine nothing short maddening . parts not line up correctly , they break if you apply even small amount pressure them worst thing all screws provided . they slightly too large holes they fit into . holes not tapped screws becoming stripped when attempting screw them . i tried smaller screwdriver than one provided but not help . i took out my drill tried widen holes but cast plastic case cracked . i eventually got it all together tried it ..... crap . pistons move up down cylinder but cams not move rocker arms which not move valves . i disassembled it all tried again , spending almost 6 hours massaging parts , adding glue , ensuring contact made using other means holding parts together , but after all ... same result . pistons move up down but all . there just too much slop rest parts actually all move together . don't waste your time .	-1
ok , this set little small side . despite this , there good number bricks this set - can't remember actual number right now . batman sets little pricey side ; but since this smallest them , it most affordable . you get two minifigs , batman catwoman- alone reason enough fans pick this set up . catwoman motorcycle great , but you can't rebuild it into very many other things . batman dragster - i don't like it it own - but it built enough parts there huge potential making your own creations . plus you get some bricks bat-symbols them . this set also includes good number tiny less-common bricks mocer would always find useful . must batman lego users	1

i got this tricycle my nephew his second birthday . although it may little beyond him , he still dazzled it . seat comfortable enough them stay it adjustable . assembly pretty straight forward simple . i gave it 4 stars because there couple parts seemed little flimsy . rear step press formed little thin . same process used seat . minor defect seat wasn't perfectly square body . since adjustable rod seat squared , when you tighten set screw , it forces it offcenter point . something i noticed , but it not dramatic certainly wouldn't affect ridability . fun toy toddler your life	1
we bought this our three-year-old daughter . i not even know where begin convey my disappointment . this no better than plastic toy lights up you push buttons . first , price unit plus software ridiculous what you actually get . second , software joke . it not intuitive . it not challenging . it hardly interactive . there nothing learned except word " dummy " . voices disturbing diaglogue snippy some times . most time you just sit there watch what little content available each program , instead interacting learning . it actually worse than plopping your toddler front tv . overall concept idea good we very excited it . we expecting learn colors , numbers , letters , lot more interactivity such games , puzzles problem solving . there freeware/shareware available internet far better than this . i'm wondering who consulted when comfy designed this stuff . i early childhood educator 10 years i would never used this my class . software titles we purchased christmas comfyland , joy music , animal world , your neighborhood , world colors . all complete total waste money . i am so sick it . i know i sound harsh , but i don't want anyone waste their money like we .	-1
i love this wagon ! my mom purchased it my 2 sons because my 2 year old hates double stroller . they love this wagon ! my youngest just turned 1 i don't even problem him trying climb out while we're moving . they love sitting like big boys looking out while we walk . lap belts very helpful just case . there little storage compartment behind back seat which great my things . my only ( very small ) gripe sippy cup holders kids down inside wagon their feet . it easy them reach , but they get knocked over roll around bottom . some other models kids cup holder up side . i think i would like better , but it may way there also ... i don't know . it not big deal . my favorite feature canopy . it installs very quickly since we live texas , i use it constantly . handle folds flat easy storage . wagon pretty good size , but it fits fine back my jeep cherokee if we take it us somewhere ( which we constantly ) . i don't know how well it would fit back car trunk . wheels real rubber too so it seems smoother ride than one plastic wheels . i can't think better alternative double stroller . my boys just love it	1

i bought this strawberry shortcake doll my 4 year old daughter christmas . when i little girl strawberry shortcake very popular . marketing re-unveiling strawberry shortcake great timing --- just when i am my own children ( they get us nastalgia ) . anyways , technology this doll reminds me technology available when i growing up 1980 , interaction doesn't work correctly . interactive pen doesn't recognize what page i am half time . page i think most educational , when strawberry shortcake supposed read story , not even programmed . i tried retried make this part work , but it just complete failure . i am pretty disapointed this doll , however , we opted keep it because i got excellent deal it . i would rather spent ten dollars more up-to-date technology actually works . my recommendation wait until next year . maybe company come out higher quality doll	1

hi , names tom , i'm 12 years old i know thing or two kids these days one my self , my parents bought this toy me last christmas it terrible , it took 3 days put up when it got put up every time you tried use it it broke so it took hour set backup . it almost impossible get orange tubes right place when you get it right place they bend back out , so when you drop ball it either misses thing completley or it hits rim bounces out . i highly not reccomend this toy . *************** my toy rating top 100:98 ***************	-1
my 22 month-old son many wonderful abilities , but puzzles , however , not quite his forte . this puzzle he loves ! he concentrates mastering it because he enjoys hearing puzzle sound he places car , motorcycle , airplane , etc . into their correct spaces . sounds clear authentic . your child ( you ) lot fun this . it also great gift	1
this game supposed gift my husband our anniversary . i took my time figuring out " theme " pictures names properties so i actually gave it him 4 months later valentine day when i finally completed it ! don't worry though , it not hugely time consuming - it probably only took me few hours complete once i'd decided everything . it deciding took while . he loves it even wanted play it right then there when he opened it ! it great idea , you make it very personal using your own pictures , etc little creativity thought whoever recipient this gift quite touched you took time put so much thought effort into gift them . only negatives actual game pieces ( different colored cheap plastic pegs)and fact there no houses hotels buy properties . i planning making my own personalized playing pieces out clay then baking it , but would've probably taken me 4 months get around doing ! now we're using pieces old monopoly set we . all all i definitely recommend this game	1
when you first realize series 1 2006 topps baseball card set 329 cards it , numbered 1-330 , you probably think you know which card not included . because wake mickey mantle death several years ago topps decided honor mick retiring card #7 . today we say modern era baseball cards begins 1952 topps set , which mantle card biggie , not just because it his topps rookie card but also because it high number , which jumps value up well . however , there card #7 2006 topps set , it mickey mantle . what kind cool card it just like all other cards set there nothing distinguishes fact mick no longer active except his career stats ending 1968 ( he stole six bases his final season those ruined legs ) . card missing #297 , alex gordon , who turned out not meet new gold standard rookie card . there some cut out versions card floating around out there you want really complete series 1 collection ( opposed four incomplete collections same price ) . intact version sold $ 7,000 because clearly it rarest card around this year . topps cut outs because under major league baseball players association rules former university nebraska star , who second pick last year draft , not sign contract until september . after years baseball cards players who never spend day major leagues , mlpa changed rules so rookie cards now only put out players who make 25-man opening-day roster or played least one major league game year before . topps anticipated gordon would make royals ' 25-man roster , but third baseman assigned wichita instead . solves mystery missing card series 1 . personally , i think this rule change great , because i now complete topps sets 1956-57 , 1961 , 1964-66 , 1968 date ( less than dozen cards each go finish my 1953 , 1958 , 1967 sets ) , i lay out my sets so you see how teams finished each year . so i like see who playing each team each year . granted , difficult today because this set already johnny damon yankees ( #185 ) , but coco crisp ( #12 ) still indian not damon replacement red sox . tom gordon ( #163 ) appears phillie photo back , but his card still says yankee matt morris ( #238 ) seen cardinal front his card giants . main thing when you get rookies series 1 ( cards 296-325 ) you actually find players who major leagues right now , including prohibitive favorite american league rookie year award , francisco liriano ( #309 ) twins . this beats going back couple years looking all rookie cards finding only handful made it show this many years down road . topps set remains set me each year because it one history behind it , so if you feel same way it must your collection . base cards set run #1 ( alex rodriguez ) #242 ( felix hernandez ) , big names manny ramirez ( #50 ) , barry bonds ( #100 ) , pedro martinez ( #150 ) , roger clemens ( #151 ) , ivan rodriguez ( #175 ) , albert puljos ( #200 ) , ichiro ( #225 ) . cards #243 -59 american national league gold glove award winners , set missing a.l. catcher , who not i-rod but jason veritek , who not topps card again this year . we then award winners two leagues cy young , most valuable player , rookie year awards ( #260 -65 ) , followed team cards/managers ( #266 -95 ) . what they doing here interesting , because they teams arranged alphabetically arizona diamondbacks washington nationals , what you hear manager card or team card each , but never both ( e.g. , you get mets manager willie randolph new york yankees team card ) . series 2 , you find appropriate counterparts . mentioned above you rookies ( #296 -325 ) , then team stars ( #326 -30 ) , which pairs up stars yankees , orioles , braves , red sox , cubs .	1

our 6-year-old daughter just got this bear her birthday - unfortunatley , it doesn't work way they claim . i hid it one end house , my daughter began searching opposite end house transmitter said " you're getting warmer ... ( which obviously she wasn't ... ) " . half time she just found bear accidentally without it giving any hints all - it just kept saying comments like " you're fun play " other such statements , but nothing help direct her bears location . she just ended up wandering around house comments coming transmitter mostly haphazard nothing where bear located . so " fun " lasted barely 10 minutes . i would love return it , but we already threw away box ... if your child wants this toy , i would highly suggest you try guide her toward something else	-1

we purchased read me dvd system our 3 year old son christmas . ok , so first , setting up remote took all mabey 10 minutes . then you simply pop one dvd your good go ! this system so much fun , it really brings these familiar stories life . my son previously familiar titles offered we them traditional book form ( nothing should replace reading aloud your children ) , i hope they come out more titles soon . illustrations same ones you find books but they animated , reallly entertaining . narrators voice very clear nice hear . words bottom page light up correspond what narrator saying . $15 dollars you spen each dvd bargain considering each dvd comes 4 different play modes tons questions you your little one answer . my son play system often it usually his attention anywhere half hour hour . someone who studying teacher i like some other educational aspects system other than just reading benefits . when you answer question wrong it prompt you give answer , rather than immeadiately give right answer . when you answer question correctly it goes further explains why answer right . this good tool use conjunction daily reading your children . fisher price definitely got it right	1

( main difference two models tires . ) i thought i purchased " classic " skinny non-inflatable tires , but instead got this product , " all terrain wheels " , which come inflated . no biggie- this one more practicle , anyways , but if you're concerned getting " original " model , look closely product decriptions .	1

we bought this product when my daughter just over year old , but wish we'd found it sooner . my mother fisher price aquarium light/monitor set , which we used during one our visits . our daughter loved watching light show , but we already baby monitor so when we got home we found tomy star . it great help bedtime , although we disabled music part toy because it irritating just not necessary . we use it nightly only changed batteries once last 9 months . i also like it straps crib , so after it automatically turns off my daughter turn it again if she not ready sleep . room really dark see projection so you'll need blackout shades or heavy curtains if/when baby goes sleep before sunset . we've very happy this product , but i'm only giving it 4 stars because it doesn't switch turn off music ( we disable wires inside )	1

my 3 1/2 year old daughter received this christmas gift she loves it . light only stays when she needs it , there storage drawer pegs it runs batteries . it also flat so it takes up very little space . my older children older model which no storage drawer ( didn't fit back box once assembled ) , came no light bulb such short electrical cord kids sit floor near outlet play it . they never ended up playing it , so i got rid i t.t his one so much better ! only improvement make so this toy truly self contained would add pocket pattern sheets . love it would highly recommend it -- just don't forget buy batteries it !	1

we got this ball pit our 18-month old daughter . we love it ! most importantly though , she loves it ! i picked this one because i don't blow it up , like you would other pits . i also like it not plastic ... plastic ones seemed like suffocation hazard me - although that just my personal opinion . plus - this ball pit huge compared other ones out there . four children could very easily fit there play . my 18-month old daughter stand up it least foot grow ( she tall her age ) . 3 openings ball pit tied up stay open . however , only largest opening velcro close it shut . i think we may add velcro other 2 smaller openings so we could close them if we like . i love it so easy put up take down . it literally springs open folds closed . plus , balls come mesh bag . everyone else right - 100 balls not nearly enough fill up pit . we got extra 100 balls - they just barely fill up bottom my liking . but , extra 100 really all you'll fit ball pit . this leads my only gripe this toy ... bottom pit where 3 openings not very high . so , we're constantly picking balls up put them back into pit because they fall out easily . i don't really feel this small issue affects toy . i still gave it 5 stars , but wanted let other people know it case it affects their decision buy ball pit ( although it shouldn't!) . all all , this such fun toy ! it big , so you need some room it , but it totally worth it	1
i work elementary school we purchased 3 these games rainy day recess . kids love it . it simple enough kindergarteners yet still enough fun 5th 6th graders . it lot like jenga you choose right rod pull out prevent marbles spilling . however , unlike jenga , clean up set up takes just couple minutes . far durability , we've used it during recess over past 3 months it stood test all those children so i would say it going last while .	1

my son received " mummy gold " present his 6th birthday , he played it exclusively around 24 hours before even looking his other presents . solid week , he visited mummy every day when he came home kindergarten . completely , unapologetically uneducational it , i see charm toy shouts " who dares wake mummy ? " " i've got you now ! " " you've mummified ! " when car rolls over activating switch . if i toy like this when i kid , i would probably still telling my friends , " you've mummified . " trouble , there really no game play , no challenge , activator switch mummy head broke week after we got it . one month later , my son doesn't even look toy . so i give it overall rating three stars	-1

action figure supposed resemblance son god , this toy lame . granted , it kind cool toy jesus , but it not very good toy . other than his arms , figure no flexibilty whatsoever : his legs permanently hidden beneath robe hard plastic his head fixed frozen forward gaze . even though his arms move , they only capable forward backward motion . finally , gliding action feature toy ( meaning little wheels figure base ) more annoyance than anything else . toy coolness factor ten ( it jesus , man ) , but toy it resembles something kid get out one those claw games	1

i think my title tip-off my review . when i got this toy , i charged it long it told me , then i tried it . it didn't even sputter . then i tried it again , charged it , since some reason it ran out battery . didn't work . i then tried bouncing beam cieling ufo , no go . i tried launching it middair , it just fell . then i charged it again . seems repetitive , don't it ? then , 5 minutes later , after almost giving up , i tried it , it actually flew , then crushed my hopes stopping falling my face , then it never worked again . just so i prove it wasn't just my ufo , 5 my friends got ufo , similar destructive results . unless you want buy piece styrofome propeller much money than its worth , don't even bother getting it . don't beleive salesmen store actually use it , they get working tested ones	-1

i bought this wagon my son when he turned 2 yrs old . my son 3 1/2 now wagon still great shape ! we keep it his room he uses it store all his toys during cold months . when it nice outside , i take him out wagon he ball . i don't see any signs chipping wooden sides still sturdy . i highly recommend radio flyer trav-ler wagon !	1
overall i only very good things say . device very durable , much more so many other kids devices get dropped , thrown around , etc . battery life pretty good even without any expansion cartridges there lot you . cartridges you get even more . unfortunately , it hard find them unless you look online , or least it me . only kind negative thing i say it rather bulkly younger kids who it supposed . my son hard time holding it his small hands drawing screen same time . usually this okay . he puts it table or bed he good go , but sitting car it harder him manipulate . it still doable , just bit tricky . one plus/minus depending how you look it batteries really there good . it got pretty big screw holding battery cover they're there pretty tightly . this makes changing batteries kind chore requires pretty decent screwdriver can't really fly but it also means cover doesn't pop off batteries go flying if you happen drop device . overall very nice product i would reccomend	1

dvd sounds like it based book al gore , but usual , dolls much better than dvds they made go . this probably because dolls designed first . i dislike molded bodices dolls but this prevent wardrobe malfunctions . this particular fairy very different , they use new large head mold , instead insipid pink ballet dress butterfly wings , she wearing nice shade blue her wings crescent shaped	1

my son given this pool birthday gift . it looked like lot fun picture however there so many pieces blow up which isn't even problem .. rainbow tree never stood up .. just kept falling over . wagon wheels fall off , green " garden patch " ( greeen thing holes ) takes up too mutch room clear plastic thing velcrow doesn't stand up . this pool doesnt hold very much water all ( came up my two year olds ankles .. not very refreshing sunny day ) such hassle clean ( you know how it .. kids out tracking dirt ) i like hard pool where you easily dump water out squirt it out . this thing so bulky ... wouldnt recommend it ... my son didnt care it either .	-1

while i love dr. suess his books , i didn't love leap frog version his book . course dr. suess words wonderful i liked how simple page lay outs ( compared some cluttery leap frog books)i not like un needed ugly phrases leap pad people added . ( bumble bee rude cruel ! )even my son said " mom ugly ! " some phrases . voices some characters sound almost sinister . maybe " goth kids " grew up got jobs leap frog , but i remember dr. suess he funny quirky not creepy . sorry leap frog guys , i feel you missed point , tone dr. suess wonderful books . i feel some phrases this book not age appropriate . i would like see more " innocent " books where they not cynical or cruel each other . ( 3-5 year olds should not forced cynical ! )i guess i am picky , i also don't let my son watch sponge bob , or tom jerry ( too violent ) but if you not picky think sponge bob great , then you probly like this book . every mom different ...	1
my son ( 3.5 yo ) loves * everything * thomas lego percy no exception . he plays him almost daily even though he certainly other thomas friends options . part attraction he gets build things ( using his own imagination ) his mega-bloks legos work percy ( duplo size ) . example , this particular set comes special pair blocks pivot . this allowed him build his own `cranky ' water tower , etc . also , he some lego wheeled vehicles ( four wheel 12-up peg size ) percy pull . these he turned into some remarkable `coaches ' . ( really some them huge ! lol)now reviewer pointed out you don't get much track any lego-thomas train kits , but i wouldn't worry it . this actually one thomas toys track doesn't seem important . my son just plays hours floor making things work percy - buildings , coaches , cranky . five stars . great educational toy . lego percy sturdy allows lots creativity . my one suggestion would buy other legos - particularly some wheels bases coaches- if you don't already own some . this way percy his educational best . your child build all sorts friends equipment . note : our lego collection 3099 . i couldn't find it amazon but i think lego duplo 140-pc . bulk tub ( 5352 ) ($15 ) wheeled base vehicles connect percy	1
