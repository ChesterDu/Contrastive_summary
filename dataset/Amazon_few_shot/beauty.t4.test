" look , then you'll like this mascara . i'm giving it four stars instead five simply because how long it lasts but if you use it once it while , then it last you while	1

i read reviews this product , decided go it . i love smell ( although it distinctive scent it may not everyone ) , it make my hair really soft . however , i semi-fine hair , it made my hair really oily-looking , even though i used tiny amount . i think people thicker hair may benefit more this hair treatment . it reminds me glorified coco butter just few more ingredients ( coco butter way cheaper ) . i use ojon restorative hair treatment again , but probably only weekends when i'm not going work ( because oily look ) . bottom line , definately smell it first make sure you like it ! they sell it pure beauty stores , among other places . , if you try it somewhere before you buy it , it ! make sure it doesn't give you " oily " look	1

ok , if you weren't already aware , blotting papers merely same material you use separate your bum public toilet . however , i am not inclined stuff few seat covers my purse . sephora put their blotting papers mini roller attractive light blue container . this better than other packaging options , where too small papers offered kleenix-box style . sephora rolling sheet option allows you take much you need , offers efficient cutting edge easy tearing . now that what i'm talking	1
why would anybody review perfume ?. my case , this first time i , reason so recommend it . " white linen " simply wonderful . am i exaggerating ?. i don't think so ... truth told , i didn't buy it myself : it gift . notwithstanding , i gone buying it ever since lucky day which i discovered it . why ?. well , because i like it , due fact it goes well my personality . i know , seems strange explanation , but it truth . this perfume isn't new , fact est�e lauder created it 1978 , coincidently year which i born . all same , who needs new perfume , specially when there old one works so well ?. this one includes , among other fragances , citrus , peach , jasmine , lilac , rose amber . result unique , very pleasant . whole , i say i recommend " white linen " those who appreciate subtle but special perfume . if you want more words describe it , i suppose i look them up my dictionary . but i guess best course action would trying sample " white linen " : then you no doubts what i am talking :) belen alca	1

i love this foundation . i warm sand moisture rich foundation . it incredibly smooth , long wearing color makes my skin look bright radiant . bobbi brown makes very natural foundation colors there range colors all different skin tones . when i'm shopping it seems most lines cater lighter medium skin tones , but bobbi brown really come through flattering options all skin tones . only draw back this foundation not provide adequate spf protection , even though it says spf 15 . therefore , you still need wear sunscreen underneath least spf 15 . i use this foundation every day i wear sunscreen paula choice ( which i love ) . i think color options available , long lasting color smooth texture make this foundation worth price .	1
i'm really anal scented/flavored lipglosses- especially ones scented or flavored vanilla , but mac lipglass isn't vanilla-ish all ! it got very pigmented color , it stays long time gloss , each tube lasts long time ... don't let what other reviewer said vanilla scent throw you off	1
these great candles make great gifts because they packed so nice . candles burn evenly nice slowly . scents great ! natural smelling strong enough but not overwhelming any way . i burn one these my first level scent whole floor unlike most other candles where i need burn multiple candles get same level scent ... so yes , they more expensive than candles you get but when i burn this one , its only one i need burn time ... cheaper candles i dont really end up savings because i am burning several once .	1
