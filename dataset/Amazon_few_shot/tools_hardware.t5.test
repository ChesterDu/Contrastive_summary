when my husband received this gift .... i promptly stole it him . it nice light you keep it your purse or glove box car . if your headlights went out you could use it drive ... just kidding . light output very impressive . i like this size since larger 4 5 battery sizes very heavy . i wish they would dream up something besides diamond-knurled grip . it gives me same feeling chalk scrapping chalkboard	1
pretty handy small yard lots 60 ft trees . or more powerful then my old gas blower but no fumes , no gas/oil mix , not loud . not tried out mulch/vacuum mode bag yet . i like adjustable contol but it little difficult adjust when running blower . sometimes adjustble control changes itself . concentrator nozzle nice . good secure extension cord anchor .	-1
machine worked better than expected , received it soon than expected , would bussiness wiht you again	1
great blower , great price . relatively quiet it blows away weeds not dog meat loaf - making leaf piles much more pleasant pick u	1
bessey clamps really help keep my work " square " while drying . even though they bit expensive , they saved me lot time money eliminating lot mistakes . i hope bessey starts making other products my shop	1
