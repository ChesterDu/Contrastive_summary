we just bought this our 3 year old . i not all understand why it labled 5 over !! cute game idea- but this not well put together . first i died when i saw super cheap , barely cardboard gameboard !!!!!!! it very small board , set up like 4 piece puzzle , i predict barely stay together after few plays . jewelery , subpar . crown rings ok , rest very cheap plain . but serves it purpose just fine :) . i give this low marks educational durablity . but jewlery box spinner nice durable !! if they put same effort into whole game it may worth buying . my daughter enjoy dressing up playing game together so salvaged star game .	1
i bought this gift my daughter christmas . it not work all . it sounds like cheap transistor radio when you attempt adjust knobs . i'd like my money back	-1
this bike may cute , but it tips over too easily . my daughter it 10 minutes she tipped over several times , then would not go it . i returned it store , after reading this site it obviously common problem this bike .	-1
our almost-4 year old son loves dragons one imaginext dinosaur sets , so we thought we'd really surprise him christmas this year imaginext dragon set . while i'm very happy how happy my son it ( he playing it hours ) i feeling we're going much same boat some other reviewers . pros : - interesting color scheme- good detail most pieces- re-configurable- dragon figure really neat- trap door , rotating floor other moving parts lot fun my son operate- got it sale local toys ' us 11 dollars less than listed web site . cons- directions picture-only , much too small see fine detail . - pieces not packaged together logically , so elements set all one bag . you open every bag lay pieces out order able find everything even then there some question whether you've got right part turned right way , per above comment directions . - whole thing comes tumbling down like house cards if you bump against it lightly/during casual play . i've put it back together no less than 5 times since i initially put it together this morning . some connector pieces don't fit tightly enough into sockets other pieces , so they tend just slide out instead locking together firmly . i think next year , we'll just stick legos	1
i would give this kit zero stars if i could . instructions say it takes 6-8 weeks seeds sprout . i kept them moist peat warm temperatures over three months after recommended period refrigeration . not single seed sprouted . i finally throw out whole kit when mold took over . complete waste time money . but if you're feeling lucky , you should know most seeds this kit aren't much bigger than pinheads , they all come packaged together same tiny plastic bag . so if you want each type plant growing different section plastic tray provided kit - like shown box cover - you need separate out each seed under strong magnifying glass . even then you won't successful , most these seeds look just like ground pepper . i accidentally spilled few floor , after sweeping them all up i literally couldn't tell them other debris dustpan . way , it takes minimum 6-8 years living ideal growing conditions any plants this kit reach sizes shown box cover . these not plants simply put windowsill . they need environment not easily provided average home - lots very bright light ( 15 hours day ) , lots humidity , acidic growth medium ( such sphagnum moss ) , 80 degrees . even then , these very slow-growing plants . keep humidity level high , you'll need some kind terrarium , preferably covered keep humidity level high . but if you use incandescent bulbs provide necessary level light , amount heat they produce easily raise temperature lethal levels . this reason i recommend combination fluorescent bulbs moist/dry heating pad bottom . sure whatever heating pad you use isn't type shuts off automatically after one hour use . some warnings ... these plants flourish only very limited range environments nourishment . care you would normally give houseplant - all likelihood - kill these plants : never feed them animal protein ( like hamburger ) . fats meat aren't digestible kill them . never use tap water water them . mineral build-up kill them so use distilled water only . never feed them insects killed insecticides , like raid . carnivorous plants should fed soft-bodies insects like small slugs , ants , termites , etc ., rather than hard-shelled insects such beetles . well-stocked pet stores carry dried mealworms , but even these need cut into very small pieces . just baby needs tiny mouthfuls food , so too venus flytraps . never fertilize them . these very slow-growing plants any attempt force them grow kill them .	-1
i purchased this item christmas gift . day after christmas , i helped my son assemble this product . it worked flawlessly first day . next day , i turned it show boys ' grandmother . apparently , steel ball " wheels " under " riders " don't roll very well after initial use . riders would hoisted top , but would fail slide onto one chutes . if they make it onto chute , they would sometimes fail glide all way bottom , or would fall off chute . failure rate went 0% when first used 90% after first day . i've purchased other k'nex items before never problem	-1
i should paid attention reviewer who stated this doll " piece junk " only good thing how doll dressed ! optimistic , after first purchase doll proved disappointing ( she laughs adorably ; she makes sucking noise ; she makes contented sound , which becomes ' stuck ' mechanism her back must turned off ; she not kick her legs ; she not close her eyes when rocked ) i purchased second doll this doll lessfunctional than first one . second doll cries continually . she close her eyes that it ! i returned second one kept first one because she more functional . don't waste your dollars this one	-1
this trike useless ! our 2yr . old tips over every time she tries ride it . buy something that worth money safer ! now our daughter won't go near thing , or any other trike ! i expected much better radio flyer	-1
this very fun toy . there numerous buttons sounds my children enjoyed very much . after you close phone , it rings couple seconds later , kids loved answer it pretend talk people . unfortunately two i bought quit working within short time buying them . i bought first one last year my son , it lasted week . first recording feature stopped working . then none sounds worked . new batteries didn't help , i even opened it up see if any transistors burned out or there any shorts . didn't find any problems ... it just refused work . we bought second one christmas 06 , it already quit too . we'll try stay away this brand	-1
i bought this puzzle my kid after he solved original cube . i read review here other places stating one needed cautious when turning puzzle . however , our major problem it orange stickers ( within ten minutes playing cube ) began peel back fall off . we tried using glue ( they no stick them ) put them back but it not long after green stickers began curling back falling off well . major problem these turned out not " stickers " after all , but rather colored squares vinyl adhereing additional stickers beneath ( all white ) means static . they fall off easily . this nice puzzle show ( impressive desk ) but not actual continued use . hopefully , rubik use proper stickers or adhesive future maybe even tighten up design so this used fun puzzle	1
five kids under age 9 four leapsters house , there rarely time when someone isn't playing one ( if not all ! ) them . we 10 cartridges , this most disappointing ( followed closely spiderman ) . there simply isn't enough them it . beauty leapster ability interact games , learn while they it . watching video 2 inch screen just doesn't cut it .	-1

my daughter just turned seven we got these her birthday because she loves outside . she thought they cool few days now they sitting garage . we put appropriate number strings her weight ( 56 pounds ) but she doesn't seem bounce very high . she needs help getting them . she upset because some neighbor boys made fun her due fact they so big awkward looking . i wouldn't tell someone not buy them but i wish i would gotten something else her .	1
what disappointment ! we got this my daughter because enticing tv commercials make it appear fun , moldable not messy . however , it none those very messy ! it just cross dust sand not fun play or clean up . it stays your hands child easily wipe their eyes cause problems . go play-doh or floam instead	-1
we finally bought these barbie magic rainbow dolls our 4-year-old twin daughters after hearing them beg it repeatedly after each time commercial aired . first , they very excited play them . positives : doll durable . it encourages participants follow instructions . negatives : i notice my daughters wave doll few times before dvd " hears " instructions . positives : dvd provides clear easy understand directions , so your doll programmed your remote control . negatives : doll set off our fire alarm few times before we figured out it doll ( we check see if there really fire ! ) when dvd not , dolls control volume tv ! this very annoying when volume increases just you realize your daughters started playing dolls . my suggestion : de-program doll when your kids finished playing dvd ! or , just keep it deprogrammed use your remote -taking all control away your kids keeping them standing so close tv	1
i misunderstood dimensions listed ( 7.5 1.5 10.5 inches ) thought it would large enough my mother see handle . it isn't . apparently , dimensions include packaging . she loves wheel fortune tv , i thought this game would terrific therapy her hands . very disappointing . i'll returning it , unopened .	1
my five half year old daughter asked this particular barbie doll . she so happy when she opened her present found mermaidia elina doll . she took it out box started play it . soon enough she lost interest however . wings large , so large they actually burden . placing doll inside mermaid tail not easy little hands either . all all , this doll just " make-up " if you see what i mean . pretty but not easy play , easily forgotten . she stand my daiughter room , hasn't touched or played since christmas morning ... not worth price	1
my son thomas fanatic . this lunchbox didn't last one week without one legs snapping off , so it wouldn't stand up . then few weeks later , he dropped it handle shattered . total waste money . it shame - it nice storage box front , but quality below even what i'd expect chinese sweatshop	-1

i've owned this toy few weeks given up it . first this toy little fun i optimistic getting it handle correctly . i'd adjust top screw trim it spinning clockwise or counter clockwise everything . this gets old after doing it every time after charge . next , using forward backward control doesn't work well . also , it drop out sky or something weird every now then . all all i wouldn't buy it again , especially higher price it currently going . try smaller havoc , it seems handle little better ( youtube few movies it flying ) . [ ... ]	1

i picked this up clearance , but i still think i spent too much . older versions made much sturdier material ; cards questions printed very flimsy compared original game . questions okay , but many very obscure . trivial pursuit great game it one my favorites , but this version dud . save your money if you older version ; it still lot more fun play	-1
i consider myself very tolerable patient parent when it come toys noise , however ; this phone way too loud baby/toddler . it actually startles my 15 month old makes him cry because it so loud . plus , it powered wonderful button batteries don't last . this given gift , glad i didn't spend my money it . aware this phone annoying , really serves no purpose too loud babies ears	-1
we so much fun this game . there truth or dares all sorts fun questions ! i definatly recommend this game if you party or even just few people who want good time ! totally worth buying this one	1

i've heard no complaints either one , it hit	1
while nothing beats wood blocks ( my opinon ) we these first , they fun ! we like they flexible easy little hands manipulate , not painful if they fall you ! only downside they large , storing them bag like putting together puzzle-they just fit . storing them toy box fills box wasted space ; so we stack them 4 rows beside toy box . it worth hassle if you space them don't mind stacking them up teaching your little one	1
i bought this set my 3.5 year old . we great time putting it together several occasions last couple weeks . once put together , my son imagines adventures it included soldiers . i am not very mechanically inclined but instructions excellent , well-illustrated clear , i no problem them . ( my only quibble orange sticks manual different shade color ones our set , took moment identify . ) first my son just wanted put together foam walls , but second time around he wanted help constructing walls castle . imitating me , he able make duplicate versions some simple structures rather well . he also figured out how make soldiers all himself , their arms , legs , helmets , swords shields . through doing set i also able explain you build foundation first before you put walls floors , third time we made castle , he repeating this point me ! drawbridge really fun well-done . it raises lowers very smoothly . this particular set really only designed make castle , so it not really meant making many different things like other superstruct sets . but this our first one i no regrets . assembly time 30 minutes first time , but after you it once it seems closer 15 minutes . pieces high-quality , fit very well , generally joy handle see . castle looks great once assembled , impress any adults or kids who see it	1
fly through spanish some best software fly pen available . you write word english hear spanish translation , or write spanish word hear english translation . translator also spell out translations you ( my only complaint translations spelled bit too quickly , especially if you're trying write them down ) . cartridge even comes some games help you learn spanish words . fly through spanish also comes booklet verb conjugation charts ideas games you play . i very impressed verb charts . they actually includes all tenses chart irregular verbs . fly through spanish great tool learning practicing spanish words . please keep mind this software not teach you spanish but it wondeful downright fun addition class or self-study program . i hope leapfrog releases more languages , especially french	1

unless this product undergone some major renovations , i would think twice buying it . here what i think last year model ... we got two barbie b-books our daughters christmas last year they quite disappointing . after thirty minutes failed attempts christmas morning , our girls put them away hardly played them since . toy rated 5-8 age range , but both my daughters ( ages 5 7 ) trouble them . i didn't expect world $50 , but it certainly should better than this ! display screen tiny dark gray text light gray background very hard see , you get angle exactly right . graphics choppy look like they came program designed early 80 - all blocky angular . sound system low grade fuzzy , making it extremely difficult understand barbie instructions . it impossible tell difference when she says " " " " or " " " " . since screens so small , text scrolls across rather than displayed all once . even my seven-year-old ( who great reader ) trouble keeping up scrolling text , my kindergartner , forget it ! games poorly explained too difficult this age range . even basic spelling games ridiculous because level difficulty jumps all over place . level one , i asked spell car , map , tar , then suddenly cruise caravan ! nonsense programming like this caused my daughters much frustration worse , made them doubt their own intelligence . we don't even turn b-books anymore . my girls able get little use out them when they play office , pretending they're laptop computers . all , these expensive disappointment not worth money	-1

feeling nostalgic romanticizing educational value * classic * toys , i decided buy this one my 4 yr old son christmas . same time , my sil bought him " kid k'nex roll go pal . " i dissapointed she purchased competing toy so i defiantly broke out tinker toy first . both my children quickly bored . wood pieces very stiff hard fit together , well . . . i'm not sure how describe this but , various pieces don't make any sense . it if someone took bunch different shaped objects threw them into . they don't relate together any meaningful way . i couldn't think anything interesting build neither could my kids so , we moved onto k'nex kids playing it ever since . they made some funniest things i've ever seen . much i hate admit it , there just better toys out there than this one these days	1

my 20-month-old son adores his fire engine . it extremely durable i little fear it tearing , even when our golden retriever tries get inside play , too ! i love it easily folds up very compact size i just slide behind couch next day don't leave it up all times when he not playing it like other similar products . i wanted point out this product made quality nylon , not plastic like old review states . there no toxic smell whatsoever when we took it out box or went inside it . windows openings not covered plastic either so there plenty air circulation . there two openings top , 4 or 5 windows , plus crawl door back full size door side . both just hanging nylon doors you roll up tie if you choose so they not way . " floor " fire engine also completely open so if your tot trips knocks it over , they won't trapped inside . it very lightweight so kids should take care not lean sides , just like any other ten t-t ype toy . my son enjoys pushing it around house because it so light . it also great place stashing all his toys . he loves piles up his favorite toys inside ! it holds it shape very well despite all play time it receives . i think it steal this price hours open-ended play endless potential your child grows	1
this parachute lot fun ! kids come up all kinds uses it , but our favorite game put baby underneath parachute middle just pull it up down . he gets kick out it older kids love see his reaction . this one bigger than i thought it would , which good thing , but unfortunately we actually don't enough people play it when my husband not home . if each person holds onto 2 handles it fit 5-6 people around . but if you only 3 people play , while it still works , it more fun more people . but i guess that way all games/toys should ! definitely recommend this outdoor ( or indoor lot room ) activities lots kids	1

you can't beat this set scenery . train itself beautiful , its mountain design ; bear family sweet , i love trees cave bears . mountain tunnel attractive too , although it low enough few our taller trains ( little engine could our maple landmark name train , instance ) clearance issues . my almos t-t wo-year-old son loves engine says " blue " repeatedly when he playing it . sadly , though , this " mountain " engine lacks power handle serious hills , especially reverse . we some bigger/steeper mountains , engine usually just doesn't want pull up them , even without any cars pull . our initial battery lasted few days , but now we put new one just every day . although engine lacks power i expected , i really love mountain set ; it looks really great brio mountain tunnel comes moose , we've lot fun all components . this really great starter set or addition existing set . i recommend brio mountain tunnel moose perfect addition this set , if you find tunnel	1

this become favorite game house - kids can't get enough it . they enjoy buying property such tia dalma shack or black pearl . only things i would different instead making it traditional monopoly jail , i would put port royal prison there instead policeman , perhaps put commadore norrington or gov . course free parking space should free docking or something similar . pewter pieces pretty cool well even though there no " human " characters . definately must potc fans who also enjoy board games	1

more often than not , my wife i usually end up playing games one opposed larger group people . some games we buy end up much more fun friends family , but only limited interest two players . target not one those games ... it works beautifully two people . addition , it several other fantastic advantages over many other games : - you remove " target " cards if you'd like control length game ( just take some out if you want shorter game)- you never really " out " game , even if you seem trailing- it very , very easy learn remember rules - it makes you think strategize , but not due complicated rules- it very travel-friendly , consisting just deck cardslike other reviewers here , i love game can't recommend it enough . it our " go " game whenever we half hour relax game .	1
i bought this my son 2nd birthday . i already read other reviews so i already drill ready assembly . it really wasn't bad only took 30 minutes us put together . parts aren't numbered but it really easy tell what went where because shapes pretty unique each step . my son started climbing up it before we could even get first part together played it long we would let him afterwards . i would probably get something bigger say 5 year old but toddlers this perfect . one side open but really , who lets their toddler play outside alone	1
buyer beware ! i bought this july 2004 what came newer hasbro version this ( yellow weird-looking thing ) not transparent looking mb original picture . i disappointed first , but after i started playing this newer version while , i began understand why they designed it this way . it little bigger than i'd expected or wanted , but it this size order your hands fit comfortably not cramp . also , center button start game original gone replaced small dot-like start button , which probably placed there case your fingers missed play buttons ( which would cause you screw up game you playing ) . extra 1 inch border may increase size less-than appealing way , but it makes really easy play less cramping . i still think they should've kept old translucent casing , but yellow . i love how there 3 types games 4 levels . original 1-game , 2-3 level ones offer little variety it easy master first couple levels . this one still challenge me . i've only this week now , so i don't know durability yet . it seems well-made	1
my kids each spent all last summer version 3 around their necks , responding every little bleep their tamagochis made . now one . 4 oldest can't wait get hers . version 4 some great new features . their " critters " go school get jobs adults . there new games well . don't pay more than $15 these . patient , call some stores find them stock . don't pay twice retail price	1

considering this game only $20 , it great deal . we so much fun remembering our times arcades we brought this game out small party . guests loved it so much we could barely drag them away . yes , it stick little , but reset works well . if you wear it out , it very cheap replace . you just need remember what it ... very cheap version old arcade games . it won't like nintendo or x-box ! if you treat it well , it last . remember turn off power switch or it eat your batteries . i use rechargeables it even though it says not too it seems work fine . best feature it plugs into front most new tv , so no pulling out tv every time you want plug or unplug it . no messing 3 million cords most us seem behind tv nowadays ! those us who adults now most time , it just stored out site drawer or coffee table when you want look neat tidy . no game cartridges lose or trip over . how could you not just love it ?	1

i can't even begin explain how wonderful this toy . our 3 year old son completely entertained hours . this sand really mold like clay , but it breaks apart like sand so you reuse it over over . here some recommendations get your money worth out it : 1 . supervise your child while playing this . it great toy enjoy together your children . any parent knows young children left sand , dirt , or any type messy item make great big mess . this no reflection product ; it just what kids like . 2 . put it clean table surface play it . it helps ensure you scoop any sand somehow makes it outiside inflatable walls right back . 3 . buy additional sand packs ensure you plenty sand . while it come enough sand fill all molds , it wouldn't hurt little bit more . all all , i would highly recommend this toy , but only if you don't mind supervising your child while he/she playing it . i can't rave enough this toy	1

we just purchased this book our 4 year old son go his new leap pad writing microphone system . we wanted our son start learning write all his letters this book very great way him practice his letters . he really likes trace his letters then practice doing some his own . this one largest books i ever gotten , its over 50 pages ! it page each letter upper case lower case . well their 3 letter words learn spell sound out trace over . there games each page even some mazes play front book . my son loves new leap pad system really likes this book . we going also get other writing book pre-k . one starter books we got it page pre-k book writing letters talk make funny sounds . my little boy laughs giggles each time he traces letters . they letters don't really this book , so took little fun out it , but each time you trace letter it play cute little song or sound say good job if you traced it right way . i highly recommend it we very pleased book . it says ages 5 up , but my son 4 no trouble lettering , pre-k even easier but what i gather only upper case letters . main reason we purchased this book because i wanted both upper lower case letters him practice . next year when he starts school he able write his name address well he able write quite few 3 letter words he learned this book . leap frog products all wonderful , this book helped my son learning write ! money well spent this book ! all work books things i previously bought get my child learn write his letters , this book really was'nt too costly . if you thinking purchasing this leap pad book- you'll happy you purchased it once you see your child mastering writing skills little few hours	1

good collectables , not so good actual toys you play . my daugter broken hook off mater ( bought her new one ) , broken wheel off dynaco mcqueen , broken front axle off tractor . mater tow equipment made softer cheaper plastic than rest toy , i expect new one break any day now . without too sexist , i want point out my 4 year old daughter probably more gentle them than average boy playing them . they never entered sandbox . they not stood , nor thrown , nor monster-trucked bicycle . while i still probably buy more , my daughter loves cars movie wants own them all , ( including frank , which they not make ) i would say all : buyer beware	1
reason why i say it better than step2 deluxe kitchen which we prior this kitchen step2 uses molded plastic which takes away alot space inside make it structurally strong , nothing wrong it glad see our recycled plastic get good use , but wood you get alot more space storing cooking/food accessories same volume . assembly took me 1/2 hour , 10 mins just take out all pieces , unwrapped them placed out floor . if you cordless drill/screwdriver allen or torx bit it save you alot time . i set my torque my drill minimum that all force it needs screw it tightly . careful long bolts , they fairly thin bend very easily . plastic window oven door came broken during shipping lower corner door paint also chipped . i tried call kidkraft phone nearly impossible get anyone you leave voicemail someone call you back ( 3 hrs now no callback ) . i tried their website instead order replacement part which so much easier . bottom line though my 4 1 1/2 yrs old girls love it . my wife saying step2 kitchen sounds working light , just she said my older one made her own sound affects playing microwave buttons . i told her electronic stuff just novelty kids they lose interest it better their imagination anyways without batteries	1

tuesday , i local walmart saw full display new transformers classic line . they bunch both deluxe class ( $9.99 figures include rodimus , starscream , bumblebee astrotrain ) voyager class ( $19.99 figures optimus prime megatron)on saturday night , i bought last 2 deluxe figures they . what i've heard , these figures flying off shelves everywhere . my viewpoint , it good reason . they've brought us classic characters reasonable price all figures i seen so far very well . starscream no exception . if you've only seen this one shelf , it doesn't it true justice . jet mode ( which how it packaged ) okay , but some coloring it bit different what classic transformers fan would used . red blues bit mixed up , but it close enough . robot mode what really makes this figure shine . one look i feeling more than little nostalgic . lot ways . this figure looks much more like cartoon comic character than any figure ever before . poseability very good , only thing it lacks ability bend knees but compare it 1984 version it head shoulders above . transformation also pretty smooth once you get used it . finally , one really nice thing there aren't lot parts lose this one , again especially compared 1984 version . now if you're not old transformers fan , just want cool toy buy your kids , it fits role well , also . fact , it displays very nicely alongside jets cybertron series . plus , i always thought fighter jets made some nicest transformers molds . i've reviewed some other transformers classics line if you'd like take look	1
my inlaws purchased this game , last several times we went down visit them , they kept asking if we wanted play . until last weekend , my answer always " no thanks " . what mistake . i am not dominoes player ( fact i never played ) , but this game became my one my favorites . talk fun , frustrating game . one one tile left ( ok , i called them " chips " ) bam , someone plays wild card , hits button , you sometimes get stuck picking up more tiles than you started game . maybe this typical dominoes , but i can't help believe introduction single , double triple wildfire tiles doesn't add lot excitement game . only thing somewhat annoying honking fire engine after siren when someone hits button ... unless you're one doing it !	1

we played this game all thanksgiving weekend , really enjoyed it . you roll collection dozen or so dice out table , players combine pictures they see dice form words or short phrases . more creative you allow people what pictures represent , more fun it . fast play mode , you snatch up dice you form phrases , slow play , you study dice write down many combinations possible before time up . it actually hurts your mind you study pictures try quickly spot combinations like : " treehouse " " playtime " " car-pet " " laughing gas " " cross-dress " or " long-winded " . i found it great creative exercise may even use it next time i need get group into " brain-storm " mode . my only beef game once you played it number times you strong advantage because you quickly recognize pictures you pre-formed ideas what combinations might come up . example , grave stone cross pink dress kept coming up , people who played previous round would immediately grab them " cross-dress " . this didn't happen often enough hinder game play , however more dice would nice	1

like its cousin , trouble , game sorry quite simple design . reality , however , it both entertaining surprisingly educational board game . it now comes packaged convenient library case . this makes storage easier , it also makes it easier kids get games out shelf without parent helping . ( why it take so long someone think this ? )the simple rules : up 4 players each begin 4 tokens " start " area . players take turns drawing deck cards moving pieces indicated , trying first get all pieces " home " space . cards offer some nice twists beyond simply moving forward : 1 = move 1 space forward or move piece out start2 = move 2 spaces forward or move piece out start , draw again4 = move backward 4 spaces ( occasionally advantage)5 , 8 , 12 = move forward number spaces7 = move 1 or 2 pieces total 7 spaces forward10 = move forward 10 or backward 111 = move forward 11 or switch one your pieces opponents piece " sorry " = take piece your start replace piece your opponent , send them back start . sure say " sorry ! " way makes it clear you really aren't . that pretty much it . game simple enough most kids who count recognize numbers grasp basics . little parental coaching , younger siblings play near-equal footing their older brothers sisters ( note - older sibs not think this fair ) . however , fun ( teaching ) comes all choices . should player use all 1 2 get all 4 pieces out board , or should he focus getting one piece time safety ? should player switch places opponent piece help herself , even if helps her opponent too ? how should he split up 7 ? working through these possibilities challenge younger players , but worthwhile one . probably biggest lessons sorry teaches , though , sportsmanship , ability dealt setbacks , idea not giving up when things aren't going well ( sorry ultimate " it not over it over " game ) . piece near finish get suddendly sent back start temporarily devastating young child . don't expect them take it well first time it happens . here , parents teach best way deal disappointment their own good example . kids who learn these lessons age 6 board game less likely melt down age 7 soccer or t-ball field . all these reasons , sorry great family game . it fun , but it also educational without ever feeling like lesson . 5 stars .	1

i think this great toy kids 18 months above . we bought this when our girls 12 months , they definitly not appreciate it ( we should listened box ! ) until they 18 months old . i would advise buying additional track which isn't too expensive- our kids became bored amount track this set , i would buy some extra trains or engines . before investing all other brio products , i'd make sure your kids like this set first . this seems good " foundation " starting brio collection	1
