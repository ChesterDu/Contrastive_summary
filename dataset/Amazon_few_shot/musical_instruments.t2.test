musician friend ships orders very quickly i got this bag together my new dreadnought guitar within 3 days . this bag really well priced ($15 ) so it great deal . it built very sturdy nylon which protects guitar well . nylon not very thick ( third-inch ) , but it gets job . it also nice shoulder straps allow carrying guitar over your back . only weakness it not many/good pocket compartments . it large pocket but pocket cover not tightly closed - it closed strap , so things could fall out if you somehow get bag upside down . it also smaller pocket top larger pocket - this pocket zipper things not fall out . overall great bag price	1
