rechargeable flashlights sensational idea - essential part any family emergency kit ( ecologically smart boot ) . while this product satisfactory , say , science demonsration faraday principle , its usefulness flashlight considerably more limited . its credit : this flashlight meant last , stand extremes water temperature . when dropped into water , it float beam-side up easy retrieval . it so sturdy tha , it likely last lifetime user - you can't say too many products . shake this light while , disk rare earth conducts enough current sustain light small amount time . while you may read claims up one or two hours , faint but workable current only lasts ten minutes , then you shake again . again . long you don't mind repetition , wan stream bluish light serve your purposes blackout or some other emergency . but don't entertain thoughts you'll able read , find small objects , or perform any kind detail work . if you don't chance compare this its better competition , you might not know say , sherpa xray offers well-focused beam you read . while no rechargeable give you kind illumination you'll find traditional flashlight , your options brighter if you stay away diamond gen . invest something more powerful you'll find flashlight usefulness becomes considerably greater . this flashlight disappointing , useless any practical context	-1

ok , i really thought this ball would great considering overinflated price since it endorsed nba . not so ! this ball feels very similar cheap $20 balls you get your local department stores ! feels similar wilson ncaa solution game ball , but slightly less tacky , but since it pumped up so much inorder it actually bounce it feels almost like rubber . i personally not like . this ball supposed able played out box , without break period . well , i hope it gets feeling better over time , but since it supposedly not break period , i am very skeptical . i honestly not feel " crosstraxxion " design anything improve feel or grip ball . if you like feel leather , this not you . i am not impressed ! search reviews this ball before purchasing ! only thing you this ball you can't others , say " well least this official game ball pros use ! "	-1

this fitness mat thick cushy , but i find myself make lot adjustments during my workout because it foot too short . my biggest complaint ' washable ' cover ( major reason i selected this product ) shrank completely unusable size when i washed it ( cold water , line dried ) . now i'm left just piece foam inconvenient transport somewhat uncomfortable	-1
i am personal trainer i asked friend check this " elliptical " strider out them . i suspicious price thinking it really couldn't elliptical machine but checked it out anyway . i suspected , this simply glider similar what infomercials years ago . except tony little tv glider most those 20 or more gliders market all gone . there simple reason true elliptical machines so popular health clubs there no gliders health clubs . ellipticals treadmills users lift their legs each stride which course more like natural motion walking running . this course engages many more muscles than gliding or swinging machines past . also ellipticals flywheel allow user add resistance while still keeping smooth motion . i've read other reviews this machine realize certainly any movement better compared doing nothing . but it question time . you could swing one these machines hours while it might kind fun some people it never come close true elliptical . i'm not promoting any one brand i no ax grind , except it somewhat annoying when companies like sharper image continue intentionally mislead public because they know it sells products . reason elliptical machines called " elliptical " user foot goes through elliptical path . gliders just swing back forth like pendulum . if you don't believe me ask any trainer or exercise physiologist . this misleading marketing no doubt they know they using name cash popularity real ellipticals . my advice my friend save little more money get elliptical .	-1
idea behind this propane stove grill fantastic . you regular burner , small grill same time . execution , however , leaves lot desired . fit finish this product extremely poor . out box , paint flaking , various pieces required adjustments pliers just make them fit . igniter mechanism my unit worked very well grill part but very badly burner par t.t he grill plate aluminum some kind coating already scratches when i received unit . reading other reviews i can't help but wonder if there two different grills sold under same stock keeping unit number : bad kind good kind . if so unfortunately mine bad variety .	-1

my box arrived somewhat banged up , but apart cosmetic scuff one handlebar , it ok . but , after 2 days i started hearing noise , seemed come interior pedals/gearbox , sounded like loose object bouncing around . i afraid i would ship it back . i called schwinn , woman asked me take pedals off see if i could reproduce sound . i assured her , it not pedals . she said , " yes sir , now please take pedals off " . i , , it left pedal ! sounded just like interior . anyway , they send me new pedals , so problem solved . sounds like they encountered this problem before . also , i frustrated inability see blue display screen , so i bought 2 doorstops , removed standard mounting screws , used " goop " adhesive make screen lean forward . now i read it ! someone scwinn not q.c. screen issue . anyway , great bike , now i'm happy .	-1

drishti yoga strap just great ! i've tried lot straps my time practicing yoga . ( several different studios , borrowed friends ' , etc . ) this one excellent . it 2 feet longer than standards straps , but it offered same price standard straps - what deal ! it also thick sturdy . i would certainly recommend this product	1
this mat great . my advice all you yogis can't keep your hands reenacting starsky hutch during downdog little patient or just creative . you two options other than getting upset throwing your new ( expensive ) mat back corner your closet . first , i recommend you buy organic degreaser . give your mat couple sprays ( not too much ) , give it scrub brush , hose it off , hang it out dry . this should help . option two put your mat washer delicate cycle cold water baking soda . don't use soap unless you really want embarrassed next time you start sweating your sun salutes . i put my mat washer haven't any problems , but i'm not sure if manduka would actually endorse . , little bit wear tear , you should end up solid mat .	1

this inflatable kayak functional easy transport given it light wheight . once inflated , it easy carry just one arm when empty . it also very sturdy feel once it completely inflated ( i would recommend electric pump you plug into your car battery charger ) . both seats kayak , there suffient room storage space two adults gear . i using this kayak mostly fishing my four-year-old son small lakes . we generally carry two fishing rods , gear box , bottled water , other related items , dry bag . even all this " stuff " boat there plenty room inside , seats place i plenty support elbow room paddling . i haven't yet taken this kayak down creek or river so i'm not able comment its use scenario	1
it always satisfying see determined manufacturer significantly improve even simplest devices . it pleasure hold use this bottle . i like : * not tip your head up drink , since mouthpiece connected straw inside goes bottom - i've never seen this design before * easy flip open one hand , yet you don't pull hard your teeth like standard designs * absense taste compared plastic bottlesi don't like : * diameter bottle too wide fit standard cage all way . it takes lot force push it 2/3 way it doesn't go further . it hasn't flown out during riding yet , but i am looking wider cage now ( not easy find ) . why not make it standard diameter bike cages	-1

first thing i thought " this lot equipment money " . it comes well wrapped easy assemble . took me hour . it relatively sturdy , although there some minor movement frame when changing exercises ( eg , frame move slightly forward when moving leg lifts dips ) . overall , i not see how they make money selling it this inexpensively based good quality this machine . keep mind , order use chin up bar , there needs enough clearance top machine ceiling , your chin touch top machine . most residential ceilings 8 feet	1

first i want make slight correction previous reviewer text : size/weight gloves doesn't change according size your hand but , rather , size you , user gloves . if you average sized male you hard pressed find sparring partner if you only 10oz gloves : nobody their right minds would agree spar you because such small gloves risk injuring receiver blows goes way up . hence 16oz standard size sparring gloves . women use 14oz children 14oz 12oz depending how big they . point heavier/bigger gloves protect your training partner . anyway , review : these good , all-around sparring gloves . their over-all quality quite good even velcros well so you could use these thai boxing well without scratching your partner neck shoulders when clinching . however , i found when you put more power behind your punches your knuckles tend come through bit so they're not safest gloves around . still they good enough pretty much anybody who looking good pair gloves sparring . i recommend you get separate pair bag gloves or 10oz gloves bag mitt work since hitting heavy bag focus mitts harden leather which , again , makes gloves more dangerous use sparring . remember wrap your hands wrists when hitting heavy bag order avoid knuckle , wrist , shoulder injuries . everlast good company most part they make quality products . these gloves what they supposed	-1

i arthritis ( psoriatic ) , diabetes , high blood pressure , heel spurs osteopenia ( pre-osteoporosis state)and i'm 240lbs . real grab-bag conditions deal ! i saw what happened when my mother broke her hip i really didn't want happen me . but , how exercise ? using warm " therapy " swimming pool only exercise i could not provide weight-bearing exercise needed re-form bone . just walking around cheap , but i'm female my neighborhood not really well-lit gone downhill bit , too . i just didn't feel safe walking around 2 : am or whenever * i * up exercise . besides there hazards like uneven pavement , high curbs all issues weather deal . i seen ads tv gazelle line exercise equipment it seemed ideal me . i could exercise my knees hips regular gravity conditions or add resistance if i needed , without any arthritis-taunting up down impact my joints . no more worries where i stepping into what . i could exercise whenever i wanted not disturb anyone neighboring apartments . i could go " far " i liked wouldn't worry exhausted going too far home not able make it back . so , i got gazelle i love it ! i chose this model ( power plus)for my use but also because my best friend 340lbs this take up 350lbs . way it constructed - which very strong solid , i'm not sure that really it upper limit . this not some flimsy , cheaply constructed rip-off . it not move , sway or " walk " when i use it . yet , handles side , i'm able lift back gazelle up onto front wheels move it fairly easily , which really suprised me since it such heavy-duty machine . any downsides ? it small bit squeaking first , but it never got point where i'd worried i disturbing anyone . because it built so solid , it command bit space . not too much , but it not model fold up so you'll need commit room it enough room swinging motion . i'd want safety-fence off around it protect pets kids getting too close when it action . over-all i am very pleased this item ! well , fitness quest	1
dials/gages appear very good quality look very nice . they very accurate far i tell comparing them my lacross clock/weather gage local weather reports web reports . hygrometer may off 2% but am not convinced this true yet i adjust it . i set barometer + 1.1 " my 1050 ' above sea level . i wish clock not loud tick tick tick . it not bad , but i would rather not all my ears very easily pick up things like tha t.t he one thing i not like i should checked dimensions it . i am not sure if they listed when i bought it . so check size what you think you life before you purchase . this one seems little small . not gages but mounting board . it could little wider little taller . i also , somehow messed up buying one such boring mounting board . i would liked beveled arch top or such . wood good quality varnish appears top notch . i don't mark down this . i mark down size mounting overal it could taller wider . not buy much , but maybe inch wider 2 ' taller . overal i like it alot . i just not realize how plane jane it mounting size .	-1

i bought this item after much research this particular model suggested me friend . no problems all shipping ; package perfect shape though only delivered my back steps . i opened up box brought pieces individually , flywheel heaviest ( though i able bring myself ) . it took me 2 hours put together . instruction book better than most i seen , only problem misprint bolt sizes , but you figure out easily ( everyone noted their reviews ) . elliptical size smaller size fits well my sitting room . easily moved if need . regards workout . i cross train my treadmill found this workout effective . there variety programs so you vary your workout . backward motion little awkward me ( i am 5'3 " ) but found holding onto lower handlebars works well ( versus movable upper ones ) . machine very quiet , only slight squeeking coming upper handlebars disappeared little wd40 . it very smooth movement you definitely tell difference increasing level , which i worried it doesn't incline some gym machines . heel rise occur when you not sit back your heels when working out , so you just need aware your foot placement . foot pads comfortable good size . most all , those who monitor their heart rate , i polar f11 heart monitor ( chest strap ) this monitor within 3 beat difference most . i recommend let monitor read minumum 45 seconds before you follow rate . this held true me even if pacing 70 rpm or above . i listen my ipod when i work out , so i not used book holder . water holder holds 24 oz polar spring bottles without any difficulty taking out replacing bottle . i highly recommend this anyone who looking increasing their fitness level comfort their own home . it very well built/solid , quiet , effective , affordable ($599 , free pad , free shipping )	1

i wonder why other reviewer leaking problems - perhaps bad silicon seal ? i compared this store other products thermos , no-names , etc , it one most solidly built food carry products i've ever seen or used . i should bought it years ago , it would saved hundreds dollars via home-made lunches . jeez , worry every time you put tupperware/ziplock lunches your bag , something going leak - how much worth put rest forever ? i used wrap my food-carrying plastic wear two plastic bags case inevitable leakage . never again . this thing solid . i must admit , it appeals my guy side , ( see my bachelor-style typical lunch dinner , below ) hammered green siding shiny metal parts . i think i sprouted few extra hairs my chest after i bought it . it looks like something you might dig out basement your parents ' house , which they would say , " oh , used your grandfather , i used it too . it still works .

( ladies , don't afraid , thermal properties gender-blind , green this fall)if you got dumped recently your girlfriend ( or wife , or mom , or whatever ) , this jar help you your process manly rediscovery . despite fact spending money something i generally discourage , this jar actually help you save money long run . you could carry it home late night subway weapon . heck , my cooking pretty dangerous payload . technical stuff : i put heated hamburger patty microwaved ( prev . frozen ) vegetables into container , thermometer . started 180 deg . , arrived 140 deg . four hours later . i bought it before 7-day road trip , living out cooler back my car . i didn't eat single crappy fast-food meal , i didn't spend dollar anything but gas . * all healthy , pre-cooked , home-style , k-dog-style stuff . get yourself corning wear microwave bowl heavy-duty fridge plastic cover , you home-cooked meal every rest stop . i've put boiling water it , let it sit overnight , top off , it still warm morning . * hotel . speeding ticket . i musta so excited this food bottle . damn ohio pigs	1

we got this use both bike carrier double stroller . putting it together super easy since it comes mostly assembled . it bit tight 2 kids though , 4 year old 2 year old . because seat not firm they tend slide together then fight because they pushed up against each other . it attaches easily bike but warned there alot drag almost like pulling parachute . i am guessing every carrier would this issue though . stoller it very easy manuever push . there some storage behind seat adds its convenience .	-1

pros : good value price , awesome amazon service . cons : nonefor right user , this great bike . ( i just see bicycle snobs rolling their eyes ... ) this case , right user - me - his early 40 recovering knee surgery . i am not yet able jog tired elliptical machine gym . i wanted bike sort rehab wheels . i wanted heavy fixed gear bike push my legs knees strength flexibility . i know there some amazing bikes market . i am not one these people who best " whatever . " nor am i looking impress anyone bike . work family obligations , i would lucky ride bike once week . i checked out bikes target walmart , but purchased it amazon one reason only - color . although i am not fashion conscious , i just can't purple or lime green bikes obnoxious stickers images skull , flames or word " extreme " it . i realize all us want look appear younger , but some point , it gets ridiculous . huffy cranbrook men came black , which always cool my book . i check out local independent bike shops , but i couldn't justify paying premium price same simple bike . however , they provide full service carry bikes incorporating latest technology . when i am ready one those technological marvels , i certainly give them my business . anyway , i placed order amazon . when bike arrived , it very easy assemble . it took no more than 20 minutes few simple tools , which everyone should their home . i notice some parts such seat fenders not made best material , but price , i live it . bike bent front wheel rim , i called amazon customer service replacement . my surprise , amazon sent whole new bike , which arrived 2 days . i simply replaced front wheel ups took spare bike back amazon . additional cost me : $0 . i wish all my business transactions smooth . i bike few weeks now . i met some neighbors , while getting some exercise . my legs knee feel better . my son joins me time time . casual rider , this perfect bike	1
product , response , shipping , packaging - all superb service . i would definitely purchase here again .	1

i'm 6'1 '' this jump rope too long me use . it easily shortened popping off end cap one handle , removing few beads , then cutting re-knotting rope . my only complaint it little too light me . if beads little heavier , it would perfect . it seem well made , well worth price .	-1

awesome sword . looks feels like real thing but cost anyone afford . great converstaion piece .	1
now i this bike , i love biking ! i bought it few reasons .... so i could fast way get my classes my college , so i could learn more biking ( relearn , essentially ) while getting some exercise , so i would chance give mountain trail biking try . so far , i've really enjoyed this bike very little problems it . few downsides tips : 1 . it not lightweight - actually it fairly heavy , i'm told , comparison other mountain bikes . ( but i guess upside you get better workout ! )2 . handlebar grip covers keep sliding off . this very dangerous . if you buy it , you should figure out way secure them so they don't slide off while you're biking ! 3 . paint job very nice ( i've gotten lots compliments other people soley how pretty bike ! ) , but since it light-colored , scratch marks bike racks may show more easily . 4 . brakes " loose " when i first got it , but they easy tighten soon i learned how it . so don't make judgment brakes unless you've learned how adjust them . few great things upsides : 1 . bike seems versatile both trail roads . 2 . gears easy change , i like this feature lot . 3 . bike seat comes it very comfortable easily adjustable . 4 . front wheel also quick-release easy remove . this makes it easier me put bike back my car take bike trail or elsewhere ( i.e. i don't need buy bike rack my car . ) 5 . price very reasonable when you compare it other mountain bikes , i feel it really good deal . since i'm just getting started sport biking , i didn't want spend $600 bucks or so . anyways , good luck it if you decide get it !	-1
these knee pads good job saving your child getting hurt . fit well ... i also purchased elbow pads my 10 year old grandson much safer	1

i took this cot 5 day music festival recently amazed how well i slept it . it made all difference get deep restful sleep every night . low profile made it easy fit my small tent ; while others may find it too narrow , i appreciated it not take up all floor space my tent . it takes bit muscle get aluminum legs into frame , but once it put together it very sturdy . i preferred using this air mattress because its compact carrying size , weight ease use ( lack deflation ! ) . wonderful addition my camping arsenal , i look forward bringing it me future camping endeavors	1

valeo neoprene waist trimmer help slim your waist . while using it exercise ( sensible diet ) help improve your outcome it help you sweat more but exercise not necessary if you just want slimmer waist why ? neoprene waist trimmer works concept training you suck your gutt . wear neoprene waist trimmer just few hours you notice immediate results . longer you wear it ( it takes 21 days form habit ) , easier it become suck gutt giving you look slimmer waist . i not recommend wearing this 24/7 or while you sleep ( give your body chance adjust sucking it itself)and each day you put it you try pull it just little tighter .	-1
after reading drawbacks this stroller , i hesitant order it without first testing it myself . i received it few days ago pleasantly surprised . many drawbacks listed other comments not major . 1 . re : size stroller when folded - my car 2000 honda accord , stoller fits fine trunk if i take off rear wheels . other jogging stroller model i considered also required removal rear wheels . 2 . re : stroller reclining too much - angle inclination adjusted adjusting straps back seat almost any angle you want . 3 . re : difficulty folding stoller - yes , stroller hard fold completely only one hand , but it mostly folds itself . i think most non-umbrella type strollers require both hands fold . overall , this great stroller . traveling though , stoller definitely required	1
mirrors small take little getting used , but once rider becomes accustomed viewing area , they work great ! they small compact out way when you don't want use them . bar ends stable great lean . i love these	-1

go sport store try some gloves find your size . most people fit 10oz pair gloves . wrist top middle finger 17cm . thumb outstretched side hand 15cm . 10oz fit those dimensions . getting velcro type pair training gloves important . laces , you not able tie up your own . velcro you put one other you use your teeth . it easy , just hold velcro your mouth twist wrist wham , pair gloves ten seconds flat . lace-ups you all day getting ready your workout . course these just training gloves , you probably want lace-ups real deal . you learn various bandaging strengthen your hand wrist bones if you want , but gloves should enough . when you finished you should leave them open air . gloves come thumb attached knuckles ( they should ) air pockets covering palm area . you buy other martial arts gloves thumb area exposed loose also `elasticated fist protectors ' more lightweight punching especially good speedbag workout . get you 80lb bag you learning some exercises keep you lean mean . enjoy	1
goggles great item use while swimming lakes , chlorinated pools . they protect eyes polutants chemicals water . but anyone knows who worn goggles , they tend fog up rendering one vision good seeing through dense fog ! i've tried spit , oil , soap , etc , nothing works good this product . simply spray inside goggles you nearly fog-free seeing . use it each time you swim maximum effectiveness . jim " konedog " koenig , lap swimme	1
strong ... compact ... easy operate . stand come scale broken . i thought returning it amazon , but called manufacturer instead . they overnighted new scale no questions asked . three stands over years . this best so far	1

i this vacuum bottle two months now , my experience only positive . i experienced no leaks , coffee remains hot enough enjoy drinking 6 hours later , it easy use one handed . it approximately size bicycle water bottle , fit into many same holders , including bottle pockets my messenger bag . i've pleasantly surprised how little coffee stained interior bottle cover , especially since i haven't meticulous cleaning	1
goggles didnt fit me very well lot wind went around them . i they didnt fit anyone my family either . i think material bit too stiff allow it comform one face . otherwise i would rate goggles highly .	-1
i wear these shoes pretty much everything but running . other reviewers mentioned , these extremely comfortable wide base provide plenty traction grip . rubber soles canvass uppers make them very flexible while still providing some support . these shoes great martial arts well normal everyday use . i often just wear them around house because they so comfortable . they tend show sweat stains very easily , but it understandable they're made white canvass	1
ok , so let me start saying i am little older than middle age i am not training marathon . i bought this jogger running 30-40 minute range , few times week . i little concerned there whole series joggers $300 up category , but i thought i would try this model . i only used it few times , but find it very functional meets my needs precisely . i nothing compare it too , but it assemble easily tracks smoothly . i think documentation could bit better , but very small gripe . jogger arrived within few days my ordering it - even super saver shipping . i saw some consumer report complaints joggers would not track straight , i definitely say this one just fine . it pushes smoothly , adequate room your feet when either running behind or alongside . i am sure there some qualitative differences really expensive ones ; but i would definitely say if you want good jogger , good value , this may one you looking . jogger who out there several times per week , but maybe not training marathon , this seems excellent choice	1
knife blade very functional . don't know yet how well blade hold edge . carabiner seems well pu t-t ogether . one more small , straight-slot screw driver would nice . internal opening needs 3/4 " wider form better handle . i really like finger contours . hole base would also nice secure keys sliding up down gate ( maybe place bottle opener ) . overall , i like it carry it everyday my key ring	-1
this far best disc i've ever thrown . it nice rim size , not big so you throw much easier forehand . size right spot . it also real nice underside perfect nice nail delay . colors also good , since there nice range , star middle looks sweet sunlight . much better than any whammo or innova ultimate disc . highly reccomended anyone wants play good game disc	1

we got rid our standard queen-sized bed make room our kid wanted replacement since . i finally pulled trigger after lot research i couldn't more pleasantly surprised . let face it , buying airbed bit craps shoot . so ymmv , even this one , but i'm going lay out my impressions : good : * sturdy construction . held up despite wedged against two chairs other side steel filecabinet . it hasn't leaked yet , though it include patch kit . * fills fast included air pump . i would say 2 minutes . * deflates fast using pump reverse air flow . you also pull pump out . * comfortable . pillow top nice feel it fairly firm . * comes nice carry bag really isn't too heavythe bad : * pump little loud . fill it up before you put kids sleep or dampen sound pillow ( don't cover pump ! ) . volume , you would think it would fill faster too . * could use more firm fill setting . * cord could little longerokay , so " bad " pretty much picking nits . i'd say this easily rivals queen aero i've used before friend house . price , i didn't expect anything nearly rugged aero better pay attention new competition . even lowest prices i've found aero , wenger better deal . i've seen mixed reviews aero quality . all airbeds faults i'm fully expecting this one not last forever , but repair kit it should well worth cost until i replace it . money , i surprised quality construction . don't hesitate buy it instead competition spare bed holidays or emergencies . i figured sure it would spring leak when it rubbing against steel file cabinets or caster wheels chairs my office ( 2 nights ! ) . it nice surprised quality good way now then	1

this knife wonderful ! i'm one last people get something looks this " girly , " but there something it appealed me . it looks cute innocent , pinkish rainbow sheen ( mine lot more green blue than picture ) , but it wicked sharp . since it spring-assist , it opens lightning quick deployed instantly opening boxes or what-have-you . i like carrying mine pocket clip , but it comes safety lock so you carry it your pocket without fear it accidentally open . very essential times when i'm wearing dress pants can't knife showing . it very small though . it perfect kids or someone like me who very small hands . though i problems opening knife thumb stud . it just small enough my thumb slide intercept edge blade . fortunately , it index-opening one flick my index finger , i open it . i carry larger knives my jeans pockets daily basis , but if you need something discreet stylish , you can't go wrong ken onion rainbow chive . it certainly looks inconspicuous , but it incredibly useful many applications	1
i owned my s610i monitor just under year now i firmly believe this heart rate monitor delivered features exactly described polar company . bundled software , though basic nature , allow you view several informative charts graphs , which gives you extensive workout history base your progress . realize full potential s610i monitor , you definitively need read reread owners manual , well software help section . alas , such torments technology . i like s610i monitor several reasons , one large amount exercises you track , 50-meter water resistance , finally multiple user features . however , dim display leaves lot desired old pair eyes like mine , hence four stars rating out five . far any durability concerns , i only replace red button , which expeditiously sent me free charge polar after simple customer service e-mail . nonetheless , this very solid performing monitor basic level scientific device gives you some invaluable information your overall health provides tangible feedback achieve your exercise goals . my exercise plans now take me level , which include incorporation jogging then running . s610i monitor not really geared type workout , so i upgrade s625x monitor 2007 . s610i monitor go my wife , not blue color pleases her , but we workout home so it should go unnoticed .	-1
you just break bank buying your dream gun but no dough optics ? never fear ! leapers save day ! $30 , you get decent red dot get job w/o bells whistles . i use it my remington 11-87 it still shoots 3 " slugs accurately after approximately 150 very punishing rounds . i got second red dot ak-74 scope more accuarate then rifle . this great scope if you plan messing around range but i wouldn't put it test if you plan hiking/hunting it days end . green dot option lost me so far but i guess it usefull if your " tacti-cool " night or something . my only problem so far pin one flip-up lens cover worked its way out i used picture frame nail replace it . otherwise , bang buck , you can't beat it	-1

my way thinking , there only two factors which keep vector receiving full 5-stars here . #1 watch face . it not very durable . it isn't even glass . it made out very easily scratched plastic . i own several watches , even plain glass face models scratch drop hat , but this one takes it whole new level . i'd worried sneeze too close fear it may implode . #2 fact despite promises water resistent 100 meters ( ie 300 feet ) this watch isn't ... far it . you danger ruining this watch if you even enter bathroom while someone else taking hot shower . humidity alone may cause problems . pretty sad when watch advertised very least capable pool cannot honestly pull off basic shower bathtub . now , said , if you take care avoid moisture whenever you , vector fine wrist computer works quite well variety areas . it'll tell you temperature ( under right circumstances , course ) , help you predict weather , give you bearing where you need go then ( after proper adjusting ) tell you your altitude . i found altimeter actually rather accurate -- oh , those reviews i read on-and-off folks bragging telling altitude inside pressurized passenger plane bogus . considering what this watch , it limitations , i believe price bit high ( you buy casio watch that'll same thing -- solar-powered , really water-resistent , all less ) but vector one thing not all suunto watches , or altimeter/barometer/compass watches come : little bubble face which allows more accurate determination specific readings . if casio add one their model , i'll probably become full-time convert . if you looking something similar , but smaller , try looking suunto observer . it dang-good-looking watch , but price considerably more , so may rather important factor you ( i know it me ) . all all , suunto makes great products , but water resistent models unfortunately not one them ( unless you going one their products actually designed underwater use )	-1

i little skeptical buying this based some other reviews mentioned instability , loose connections , etc . but i bought one these local store today ( because it only one they i needed it today ) i am very happy it . it very easy put together , connections tight , my six-year old boy very stable back . he absolutely loves it i no complaints . it also surprisingly easy pull large child . we " bike seat " taht we still use out 3 year old , i think it actually easier pull my 6 year old than ride my 3 year old seat , probably due center gravity . one last thing - i paid $99 + tax this store . amazon offering very good deal . happy cycling	1
i've bought three these laptop backpacks this best . well-made , well organized , lots space . seems durable , but haven't used it enough vouch it . protect my laptop physically its padded pouch , but also theft . how ? backpack doesn't yell out " i contain expensive laptop " - it looks like cheapo student bookbag . you can't beat price . highly recommended	1
i over 7,000 hours experience teaching studio quality , spring-loaded pilates equipment . last years i taught professionally , i cut down my insane teaching schedule teaching group classes these machines . they safer than spring-loaded reformers because bungee cords -- springs snap back . bungee cords move , but not kind propulsive , really dramatic force you see springs . over over again , i watched students things these reformers would injured them spring-loaded equipment . my own practice , lack attention caused moment or two real danger ; worst thing happened flying bungee cord cutting upholstery . safety aside , these provide enough resistance really good workout . they big enough anyone under 6'2 " all exercises , exception semi-circle , which more intermediate exercise anyway . students knee hip injuries reported they more comfortable these machines , possibly because bungee cords provide less resistance . also , these reformers what reformers designed : two hour-long workouts week , these machines increased flexibility , improved back pain dramatically changed shape bodies , just like studio quality equipment would . ( yes , virginia , there way get rid saddlebags without lipo . ) finally , unlike some other pieces non-studio quality equipment , i unequivocally recommend these even very fit men . runners , bikers hunters my classes really found machine workouts challenging . cons : i never able get replacement parts . you need two people or one man over six feet move each machine . attempt fold them up again your own peril . lock them away children , or vice versa -- even bungee cords cut	1
there lot similar floor mats sale amazon , but these cheapest decent ones here . thickness this flooring just enough mitigate hardness bare cement floor , but aren't so " squishy " you can't put chair rollers i t.t he tiles go together much more easly than i expected . there enough give jigsaw edges you don't fight get these lined up . other hand , edges rigid enough they hold together tightly . only potential negative this set there jigsaw edges all around , i don't think there plain-edge pieces available finish them off . i don't really care this , i don't mind look , i don't need wall-to-wall coverage . oh , one last thing . note contradictory information product features/description regarding how much you're getting . it 8 , 2'x2 ' squares , total 32 square feet . you make 8'x4 ' square . if you want 8'x8 ' , order two sets	1
i originally bought kit elsewhere handles , 3 assorted tubes clips , couple accessories . i love idea , found lot easy ways exercise home . my back deck wood arbor above it , i put these around horizontal wood piece , lot exercises involving pulling down ( like pullups , etc ) , or i loop it around vertical post other exercises , including leg exercises . but ones i bought keep breaking , so i bought bulk cable , which much cheaper than kit . it also got much heavier duty tubes , so i don't need use so many one time . also , i ability make different sizes expand types exercises i o.o ne thing aware sometimes ( least 25 foot lengths ) , it may not continuous length . my case , there two pieces some , but total length more than 25 feet ; since i intended cut it into pieces anyway , it ok . i mentioned it wasn't one piece , they offered swap it me , seemed very motivated make sure i happy product . if length important you , you might want contact them first let them know via their toll-free number listed product ( 866-263-0674 ) . i disappointed customer service rep , who made promises send email special offer future purchase my trouble , but failed follow up - i never got anything	1

over weekend i bought stanley thermal bottle . i've wanting thermal carafe while now , this one capacity liter coffee , tea , soup , etc . i really jazzed this specific bottle , because it aesthetically rich testosterone . design seems straight out first half 20th century . so you know geeky-old-me , i perform thermal performance test . i first pre-heated bottle several minutes using hot tap water . i filled carafe brim boiling water , checked temp using my probe thermometer . 205 degrees . this morning , exactly 8 hours after my initial measurement , i cracked bottle second reading ... astonishing 177 degrees ( i woulda thought 150-ish ) . probe thermometer showed temperature room 73 degrees , i ac thermostat constant entire time . if you run numbers through newton law cooling , you find k-value 0.029801 per hour given my environment observations . empirical calculation , means bottle contents would cool down 150 degrees 18 hours room temp ( temperature i would still consider beverage or soup pretty hot ) . 24 hours after filling near-boiling water , contents would likely near 137.5 degrees ... still pretty hot , still somewhat capable fighting off some foodborne illnesses . it would take 53 hours bottle contents cool 100 degrees . your mileage may vary , but this thing appears winner	1

i'll break this review into parts : shipping : #1 ( see previous review ) - horrendous , disaster - paid new machine/rec'd trashed , used one . sent it back . ups . received #2 - new machine via dhl . box torn again some parts came out . dhl tried dump it porch , but caught them fleeing scene . everything new wrapped plastic this time , so i decided inspect carefully see if any damage . i believe box damage occurred when dhl picked it up edges lid . this heavy box . inspection : i unwrapped all pieces opened plastic small parts bags . only slight scuff marks present one piece machine . laid all parts out floor checked them against parts checklist . all parts present accounted . assembly : after parts inspection , it took me 2.5 hours . not use your power screwdrivers i tempted , but you might want get your own socket/wrench set phillips screw driver . tools included : allen wrench , nut/socket wrench (?) , spanners couple little rods insert through spanners . ( i thought these parts originally ) . directions primarily german other languages including english or ( gb ) great britian . assembly instructions pictures which confusing . cut out parts list page keep it reference so you don't flip back forth . important : keep all connections " loose " before proceeding next step !!! if you tighten nuts loosen them , you break locking feature kettler says this safety issue . tighten all nuts bolts hand , feel how firm connection . also , there left right well up down things . study diagrams carefully !! quality parts phenomenal . nuts bolts machined beautifully gleaming . no cheap , pot-metal - just fine german steel ! ja !! you don't worry cross-threading or stripping , everything fits perfectly . caution : pinch points arm/piston area during assembly not cut your fingers like i !! after assembly , i tried it out first time , it like heaven ! motion similar what you see dr. jarvik doing lipitor commercials during news , where he rowing across lake . you feel like you're flying , it whisper quiet ! what great stretch !! it felt fabulous , go slow first assure proper rowing form . keep your back straight - read book ! if you're tall like me , 5'10 " - this machine you . also , my boyfriend - who 6'5 " ( german ! ) plenty legroom spare when he uses it too ! also , resistance adjusted turning pistons , it little tricky sure install number " 1 " top . computer loads features , but haven't checked them out yet . after usage - i folded arms up . it very compact when folded . i don't see how one stand it against wall when folded , but i small , dedicated room gym equipment i push it against wall folded position floor . allow 65 " full extended " wingspan " machine when planning floorspace . overall , i love machine !! i wish kettler provided photographs finished machine rather than drawings . if you don't want mess footstraps loosening during workouts , get some black velcro add . i plan doing . one final note : there warning printed rowing arms , i asked my boyfriend translate it german . here basically what it says : " don't use rowing arms means support yourself/weight ( getting up , because machine tip side ) " . it so nice german around house !! you won't disapointed if you buy this machine , i would buy it new , rather than used . i think you'll love it it true , sculling motion opposed back forth cheaper types .	-1
