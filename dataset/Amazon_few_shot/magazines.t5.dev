let me first say i am one martha stewart biggest fans ! i enjoyed msl magazine years loved format " old " show ( new one taking awhile get used ) . i jumped body soul when it first came out , but repeatedly disappointed obvious exclusion anything " male " articles . not mention , articles relationships love never mentioned same sex partners which i find totally unacceptable , unforgivable , just plain stupid marketing standpoint . why exclude men gay people ? i also noticed there no ads advertisers marketing men either . most if not all articles nothing more than " new age " pablum , either " borrowed " or stolen much better magazines such alternative medicine . don't waste your time or money this one . this isn't even good enough line my cat litter box	-1

reason once two things going it . it articulated principled libertarianism , it consistently interesting magazine . now its ideology fuzzy ; certainly not consistently libertarian . it also dull aimless , often badly written . case point : current issue i write includes defense fda writer who publically attacks prominent libertarians , who works organization supports prohibition sale nutritional supplements , well promoting state assaults tobacco industry . " old " reason would never published such piece . nor would reason previously published ronald bailey article advocating mandatory health insurance . bailey also supports iraq war psychiatric coercion . bright spot continues writing jacob sullum	-1

i subscriber time over 15 years before reader my parents ' subscription . it pains me say this magazine forgotten what it . frankly , only issues worth their salt those resulting major world event such natural disaster or terror attack ; such events seem energize otherwise listless staff seemingly bored editors newswriters . newsweekly obligation go beyond newspapers -- use extra couple days provide more balanced analytical view . unfortunately time fixes its editorial position beginning story -- any future coverage designed prove time initial position correct . immediate taking editorial position then carried into all future coverage event ; stifling analysis preventing any analytical development beyond first few stories --" we told you so , we told you so . " even worse , coverage lengthy story peters out until something sensational happens which point sensational event becomes ultimate interpretation entire story . can't magazine occasionally admit it wrong rather than turning its eye away story continues burn ? out sight , out mind mantra ... fact , i sometimes debate whether decline this magazine mirrors or outpaces general decline our media ; newspapers failing , television news can't seem get away gory or sensationalistic , even academic journals specialized themselves into irrelevance . we seem greater appreciation comedy than analysis . neutrality dead . frankly , i don't care so much any perceived editorial slant i fact magazine increasingly boring irrelevant . time used excellent coverage trends events outside united states -- no more . iran building nuclear weapons but merits occasional blurb world summary page . african states making vast strides towards democracy , we get article nigerian computer fraud . russia emerging turmoil perestroika its painful transition much teach costs value democracy , but we seem focus only latest roadbomb iraq . japan , one world most influential cultures , week i originally wrote this review ( see 12-month subscription ) merited only snippet regarding royal marriage analysis foreign intrusion into sumo wrestling . somewhere wide world fascinating place or culture which time could send correspondent bring place people alive its readership , instead we get tabloid excrement nature joel stein puerile take pornography social deviants . but most damning fact after reading time one asks : how hell our world become boring ? time try emulating economist rather than enquirer ? someone needs step restore proud tradition complete in-depth coverage -- educate reader world which we live ; don't wait until either natural disasters or internal politics shine spotlight any various cultures countries which real interesting events take place every single week . time history potential five-star magazine , if only it would just focus finding reporting news	-1

this magazine just page after page hollywood p.r. agencies releases . unbelievable . why didn't i think it ? i know all magazines look editorial content outside sources , but other than few pages very subjective movie/music/book reviews , this magazine just re-writes prints hollywood press release after hollywood press release again again again . this magazine must not staff writers , but must employ army copy editors manning warehouse dedicated fax machines or e-mail inboxes . funniest thing this magazine how first few pages may dedicated typically obsequious press release provided , say , tom cruise management company/major film studio/hired pr flak fawning over cruise or his newest movie - then you turn movie review section where some clever , sassy , wanna-be hipster movie reviewer proceeds tell you movie absolutely sucks . uh , okay - wait , didn't you get press release ? if you tivo extra theme entertainment tonight your ringtone , this magazine right up your alley . otherwise , don't waste penny this nonsense .	-1

" experts ( including naturopath , gynecologist dietitian ) answer this question excellent responses . - " medicine cabinet : attack weekend warrior " natural remedies aids those like myself who love weekend warriors . - " clothes pose " great yoga gear ! - " medical breakthroughs " - " healing supplements : 8 ways beat anxiety " - " fitness fix - knee savers " longer articles include : - " healthy appetites : savvy strategies eating well " delicious , healthy recipes tips . - " good medicine : clean , healthy mouth " well-researched article " mercury fillings , fluoride toothpaste best at-home remedies " . - " five paths peace " five simple meditation techniques . - " eat beat heat : yin foods " more great recipes ! - " sacred spaces " - making your home your personal retrea t.t his only sampling ; fact , that less than half magazine alone . some articles fairly short , but provide just right amount information get point across . my personal favorite last page , " make one change " , where this month change " upgrade your z " . it included simple tips i able implement immediately . amount advertising seemed slightly less than usual ( probably same amount you'd find yoga journal , but not nearly many oprah magazine ) , they seemed line natural health focus . judging past reviews natural health , it seems magazine bad run 2003-2004 timeframe . let remember magazines change editors frequently . i found none past complaints true this issue , but may not so future issues years now . me , i want subscription asap	1

economist best weekly magazine current events . whether you conservative or liberal you appreciate well thought out reasoned essays this magazine offer . i don't think this end up swaying people political opinions too much but it least provide informed opinion . americans know too little world around them this perfect tool fixing tha t.t here arguments this magazine swings both sides political fence depending your views . i my opinions this but still love it . articles i disagree force me think hone my own debates . compare this magazine newsweek or time like comparing precision automobile one those 25 cent rides kids enjoy . sure they make motions car , look like car but end they don't go anywhere you wasted your money nothing show it . this magazine more its short essays than newsweek could ever its six-page layouts . too bad there isn't " teen " version this magazine . would lot rectify america education problems . i find argument some people cite this magazine severe pro-laissez faire bias ridiculous best . it like criticizing auto magazines combustion engine bias . this magazine economics . since laissez faire economics basis just every single economy world , they concentrate it . sorry but marxist keynesian economic models didn't pan out . maybe if feudilism mounts come back they might change their focus , until then we stuck reality .	1

macworld glossy monthly around long apple making macs . i've subscriber most time - if i saved past issues - could probably paper cupertino main streets this periodical pages . there number magazines devoted macs their unusually devoted users . macworld probably most mainstream dependable them . most periodicals dedicated high-tech fields , there more these pages than casual user digest . many articles appeal macgroupies subset macusers , those who find product fascinating itself rather than merely boon productivity dedicated other ends . however , even normal macuser like myself ( since 1987 ) enjoy coverage all things apple , including constant improvements which company become known relentless speculation what comes next . small tornado controversy brews pages over whether macworld should dedicate so much space ipod music issues , but apple seems fairly dictated its sprint direction magazine dedicated covering company products need follow direction it sets . there lots productivity hints - if followed - keep you increasing your own effectiveness machine . most useful feature me high-quality discussion improvements apple continues build into its own operating system(s ) . macworld go-to mac magazine , if that what you need	-1

" other popularized pseudo-science , i am incredibly thankful scientific american still true scientific method .	1

fine cooking takes somewhat consumer reports-like approach cooking , much manner cook illustrated . but there several key differences set fc apart make it superior ci : 1 . fc , not all voices sound alike . ci , every article , no matter who writes it , sounds though it written same person . i understand why they this ( keeping focus food not personality , maintaining consistency ) , but it gives magazine creepy , musty , claustrophic , stepford wives-like quality . this magnified fact there no " outsiders " allowed into ci kitchen -- no visiting experts , no star chefs , just ci staff their identical voices . 2 . fc there no christopher kimball essays : ci bow-tied editor fills up entire page already thin magazine folksy , prairie home companion-like homily why owning large , upscale farm rural new england makes him morally superior everyone else , replete recurring cast curmudgeonly cranks crackpots -- all which absolutely nothing any food issue , or lives anyone else planet , possible exception martha stewart . it embarrassing , self-indulgent soapbox . but he leader cult , so don't expect his sermons dispappear any time soon . 3 . ci advertises itself " ad-free " -- then proceeds glut its pages print ads blow-in cards touting ci cottage industry recycled books . i'd rather peruse offerings fc advertisers , whose products least potentially useful me . 4 . fc no constantly recycled material . such supposedly modest operation , ci puts out staggering number books , many them single-topic tomes borrow heavily recipes already printed magazine , well other , previously published ci books ( there evil twin " america test kitchen " series books dvds ) . you're likely find same pie crust or tomato sauce recipe 16 different books . incestuous nature this recipe factory casts unflattering mercenary shadow across ci mission . 5 . fc offers superior quality production methods . glossy paper attractive , full-color photos fc put ci faux-downhome matte paper hand-drawn illustrations shame . 6 . fc much more variety . fc also its own group regular contributors , but they supplemented each issue experts variety fields culinary arts ( who write their own unique voice -- imagine ! ) , giving magazine broader scope much fresher feel than ci , which tends stick standard set all-american classics , which they recycle every five years ( how many times you revamp " secrets macaroni cheese " ? ) . give fine cooking look . it hands-down best food magazine home cooks	1
