friend mine got me subscription this magazine because i like cooks illustrated . this magazine nothing but ads snazzy expensive foods restaurants . there so few recipies it i wouldn't call it ' cooking ' magazine . what few recipies they don't explain why they chose ingredients used or give much detail all . if you consider yourself ' foodie ' who likes go fancy restaurants likes know what hip latest gourmet food wine , then this magazine might you . if , however , you like cook know what you doing why you doing it , try cooks illustrated instead .	-1
child i remember finding this magazine my doctor office reading it because it only thing available . it not changed much . there no redeeming features make up dated patronizing content . this magazine neither stretch your child mind nor keep him entertained . it only teaches child what he already knows feeds him what he already seen . coming era global connection , children must become aware other parts world lifestyles alien them . only telling them what already common their everyday lives helps foster racism xenophobia	-1
i reading this magazine work , i consider it trashy magazine . it only focuses sexual part women , like if sex best thing world , because they this article which girl riding taxi , she thought taxi guy fine , so she unbutton her shirt told taxi guy touch her breasts . then she says it * best experience she ever . i just cant believe they publish garbage like , giving message women its ok undress yourself total stranger , who you dont even know . i prefer read things focus more inner heart , emotional , spiritual side things . read books help me better person right now future , throw away garbage this society	-1

i am utterly disappointed direction gamepro taken over past two years . i actually stopped my subscription 1 year , but came back 20 issues $10 their ( 10 ? ) year anniversary . i forget . but magazine really bad . one thing i laugh , retro corner . they info issues 5 10 years before , they always announce number pages 10 years ago . i think most recent issue , they said : 140 pages ? huh ? i think my last issue around 100 . don't try tell me they've lost 40 pages advertising . too bad on-line reviews websites , taking over subscriptions hardcopy magazines . i'll stick hardcopy until end my life . or until quality these types magazines gets so low , i can't stand it anymore . or until my subscription runs out this craptacular effort . you guys pretty good 5 years ago , but you've gone pot these past two years ! i'm talkin ' you watchdawg !!! you guys suckin ' lately !!! mc white said : you guys suckin'!!	-1

i got free one year sub . gaming mag . purchase game gamestop . after it ended , 6 months later , i started receiving this magazine , i thought it same one , some kind mix-up . but i didn't get magazine every month . it skipped few . finally i went their site complain , they promised send extra issues make up it . i told them there must mixup ... then i cancelled my supposed " subscription " , only receive e-mail saying now they wouldn't sending me anything , even extra issues promised . stay away these people ! these people extremely unprofessional . try playstation mag instead if you ps - i just reccommended it	-1
i admit , they some good recipes , but most them not simple very time-consuming . there always million ingredients each little recipe . if you stay-at-home housewife absolutely love cook , buy this , but if you just normal , you won't find many recipes here you . i suggest you consider ' cuisine home ' before you buy this one	-1
i would agree previous reviewers , burgeoning ads this magazine over past decade made magazine chore read . number ads now easily exceed number pages devoted articles . it also quite disturbing note many those ads ( possibly 50% or higher ) pitch ultra high end products , such viking ranges , bmw , oceanna cruises , trips bora bora ... wtf ? although i enjoy i luxury meal , i don't want go into massive credit card debt purchasing products this magazine selling . ocassionally , behind clutter , i find useful recipe ; i rarely find interesting article . i am going let my subscription expire end current period	-1
articles weren't anything new . mostly fluff cosmetic/clothes ads . better info exercises oxygen women mf .	-1
i reader businessweek over 10 years . i noticed it significant change focus over last year . while there more articles " personal business " , hard-core articles gone way newsweek , u.s. news world reports . nature articles lightweight not reflect issues important decision makers today . like many others , i noticed political slant or agenda over last year . specifically , their commentaries economic analysis trend left . bob kuttner co-editor american prospect contributor boston globe . every one his articles begins premise president policies bad then followed tortuous rational thesis , include discussion days gold backed currency . andrea d'andrea tyson better , but former clinton advisor , not objective her analysis . alternative economic opinions far few what opinions they tout , not agree numbers stated their own figures week . while bw potential great reporting based their resources , they let their editorial priorities get way serious business reporting . serious business readers students , i recommend going alternative sources . yes , i let my subscription lapse this year .	-1
i ordered this magazine without really knowing anything it . i very disappointed . not enough recipes . recipes included not really ones i would use .	-1
i yet see pw review anything not vetted pc police , not mention utterly stupid . when they want pan book , they apparently list criticisms they pick random , such " non sequitur " or " murky argument " or " reductionist " . they pick them throwing darts list writing down whatever phrases darts hit , ways prove they don't actually any understanding what terms mean . it especially annoying because even when it book i like , i easily see criticisms someone different worldview could make would valid , but they don't make them ; would require work . reviews so shoddy wildly inaccurate i thought asking amazon.com stop using them product info pages , but then it occurred me any book pw pans guaranteed good , so they useful backwards way . anytime pw praises book , i don't bother it , but if they attack it , i know it going great	-1
this magazine used very thorough , it used very good providing me tons deals tips i never would found my own . it great , very opinionated . but last year sometime , they changed look it now there lot less text . it much more style magazine now , that not what i want travel magazine i bought tell me money saving ! worse , except 40 best vacation bargains , which still okay , most articles forget incluce lot money-saving tips instead they too often suggest i expensive things . since when $225 night hotel considered budget ?? headlines captions expecially smart-aalecky . it not good expert advice it used ! i noticed arthur frommer isn't editing it anymore which maybe why -- bring him back ! my search true money-saving travel magazine unfortunately resumed again	-1
i subscribed forbes magazine year or two , general content good , but i cancelled my subscription 3 reasons .

laptop mag best described negatively : it not really serious computer magazine . it more or less like consumer guide , which basically paid advertising . this means you can't really trust article here because you don't know if they not written unbiased writers . end , i feel this waste money . besides , you get all info free web , cnet or zdnet , anyway	-1
i've read many positive reviews this magazine i receive , several months ago , trial issue . after sending subscription fee , i billed again . i wrote note letting them know check endorsed deposited . yesterday , i got notice telling me my subscription expired after one issue . i give up . it might good , but customer service really lousy . what disappointment .	-1
[ ... ] i got choice free subscription either parents or child magazine . since i already got parents , i chose child . i not renewing when my free subscription up . magazine boring , articles irrelevant there too many kids fashion pages . if you want magazine parenting/kids , go parents .	-1
magazine broad range patterns . out 1 year there 10 things i want make . or i should say i wanted make- until i started first one . they high percentage errors patterns . one issue 13 out 30 corrections . worst part , they don't seem post corrections until reader tried knit item told them what wrong . which means unless you want lot counting , calculating , ripping reknitting , you wait until issue out 6 months other readers found errors . i'm working cardigan i plan give someone christmas , found 2 major errors so far . no idea if i get this time when i get if i'll cardigan or layette ! one more error causes me rip it out start over i'll find new pattern or make my own . after spending $130 angora yarn make this gift , i'm not going give up , but renewal notices i get magazine promptly thrown out . update- still working cardigan , pretty much start over redesign pattern my own . still no correction online , but they added many other corrections other patterns this issue . corrections sometimes little , simple ones , but some corrections total rewriting instructions or charts ! i thrown out all magazines so i don't get tempted try pattern them	-1
i cook almost everything scratch , so i figured home cooking would people like me , who make effort make good quality home cooking without silly ingredients you see some those gourmet magazines . instead , recipes consist packaged dough , bottled sauces , etc . i don't need read magazine figure out i put jar spaghetti sauce some pasta add velveeta make casserole !	-1
truth-be-told , i hated " " give this magazine even one star , but least i could via this rating system . this magazine some good writers but needs new editor . mr. shoaf very bad his job , clearly , seems use reuse " buddy system " using writers . perhaps he gets kickback ? any rate , this , overall , cruddy example journalism . my facts tell me it should fall under fiction rather than nonfiction many issues . i am it . get new editor perhaps i reinvestigate publication . until then , so long . i no time absolute rubbish	-1
this just like english version but spanish . content not reflect culture or morals general latino people . nearly all models ( especially cover ) white and/or american very thin tall . they try use photos american celebrities when they brown hair , example christina aguilera , mandy moore , angelina jolie or just natural brunettes like catherine zeta-jones . maybe cosmo thinks we're too ignorant easily fooled dark hair dye job or computer generated tans . there tons beautiful succesful latinas could easily placed covers but i think they'd rather just use same photos they already took their english-version magazines . ads also high-end american european products . i've bought this magazine mexico while it still same problems least they feature real mexicans mexican products some ads . if you want magazine more reflects latino culture , although it mostly english , get latina magazine . they use lots latina models it more relevant latin-american women people interested latino culture	-1

this magazine i frequently get confused foreign affairs magazine . primary difference longer well-written essays leading experts affairs whereas foreign policy more frequently published , more up date more direct version other . it would great both since policy keeps you more current high degree professionalism while other gives you deeper detail . if you don't lot time read , policy one you'll need enjoy .	1

cooking school instructor , i believe there only four pieces reading material home cook needs : quot ; fine cookingquot ; , corriher quot ; cookwisequot ; , quot ; food lover companionquot ; , goldstein quot ; wine lover cookbookquot ; . your magazine it all : excellent cooking tips ; first-rate articles rating various appliances cooking tools ; excellent pictures detailing procedures ; recipes error-free ingredients listed order which they used instructions ( pet peeve mine ! ) . i agree recent review stating level difficulty your recipes encourages stretching one cooking abilities but not poit giving up . past years i really liked you highlighted small grower or breeder back cover -- one goat cheese apples come mind . all editors contributors : keep up wonderful work	1
printed daily newspapers , wsj easily superior just every aspect really matters . nyt lot more better photographs , but they best viewed computer screen . there not much argue ( regarding relatively conservative editorial page ) this review hasn't already written ; one more center-right midwesterner recommendation not going much incremental value . however , investor consumer i state wsj its website primary source credible information businesses , law , finance consumer products . anybody works living , mortgage or long-term savings plan would benefit reading wsj often possible . there simply no substitute	1

i'm subscriber road track , car driver , motor trend . simply put , rt one i look forward most each month . if you're looking well-rounded auto magazine , this it . rt you'll find : -road tests first drives . -an excellent " ampersand " monthly feature all latest info future cars prototypes . -news latest races drivers . -top-notch photography art . -witty columnists . ( see side glances peter egan)-the occasional technology-related feature . -classic cars , classic drivers , classic tracks . best historical content business . -very little content suvs . ( positive my book)the competitors : car driver substantially more road tests previews , some good specialty features pretty regular basis , but hardly anything racing history . frankly , motor trend isn't anything write home . articles shorter less captivating , they can't seem settle design theme , they also lack racing historical content . if i pick just one , road track would definitely my choice .	1
under radar filter only music magazines i come near . i hear mojo just informative , renovative , enjoyable , but i'm little too close-minded care other genres i ... don't care much . fans rock/pop/what kids calling " indie " /alternative/punk/post-punk/folk/ !!!!, take gander this . covers slick durable . they don't look out place sitting coffee table	1
harper , like atlantic new yorker written those looking more in-depth analysis coverage political cultural affairs sampling serious literary prose . personally i prefer atlantic , which i read regularly , only picking up harper when i time something it interests me , which usually two or three times year . just looking cover pages inside convey harper serious tome , perhaps too serious casual reader , especially compared more colorful pages atlantic playful new yorker cartoons . nevertheless , harper american icon it genre published many articles great names since it inception 1850 . number reviewers complain it left leaning stance clearly sprouts now recently departed editor lewis lapham , who outspoken critic current administration . mr. lapham shares his views two page opinion piece full page listing various " fun facts " known harper index . serious readers able get beyond this simply " viewpoint " see entire magazine serious writing it . i would contend this represents best " critical analysis " rather than bias . i would also simply suggest you view other reviews made people espousing this periodical overly biased . instance , least one those claiming liberal bias here also praising ann coulter book . so if you feel underwhelmed typical content you get even 60 minute broadcast or political round table free-for-all you're interested enough this magazine read it reviews , you should probably pick up copy it two or three months give it try . i recommend you also check out new yorker atlantic compare	1

when it comes music , culture , overall coverage meaningful entertainment , paste where it . fairly new publication ( starting july 2002 ) , magazine soared popularity holds its own marketplace saturated bland repetitive articles . if you're sick reading magazines only focus mainstream trends , surface culture , next teenage sensation , then this your magazine . publication focuses wide array music , but emphasizes folk , indie-rock , alternative genres . its pages you'll find very useful album reviews , articles array films ( especially indie ones , which hard come these days ) , well book suggestions . but far best part magazine every issue includes sampler cd , which include anything short films , new music , and/or documentaries . paste prides itself catering its consumer perfect reading material anyone who still enjoys stumbling onto new music , learning growing their song crafting , keeping up good quality ... not quantity . magazine blatantly states it looks " signs life music , film , culture ...

i'm 25 years old new atlantic [ monthly ] . not read publication some twenty-odd decades like rest reviewers , my opinion this : magazine wonderful . it infinitely more literate illuminating than most other periodicals . i'm letting my subscription time run out ( talk " also-ran " ... ) . some what other reviewers said true : there seem awful lot stories war/armed forces , times i would concede slight liberal bend . but neither enough dissuade me continuing my subscription . so " younger " readers , my advice switch off tv , throw out your news weeklies , subscribe .

nyrb atlantic monthly among my favorite subscriptions ; terms sheer intellectual depth range , it very tough beat nyrb . while i not read nyrb cover cover , i end up spending least 5 hrs each issue . main strength this magazine fact typical article written expert deep knowledge subject ( some times opinionated ; but always intelligent engaging ) . while article typically draws more than single book , i like fact article typically written commentary around theme more than summary books under review .	1
i just received my first order , i love it ! this magazine covers broad range topics includes designer techniques , current trends , period styles so much more . it tons vibrant pictures illustrate articles . i think this magazine would ideal someone just starting out design gain basic understanding wide range topics , also experienced designer keep up current trends fill gaps knowledgeable tidbits	1
there seems great deal psuedo business magazines . i like business week hard hitting , features excellent articles . i always several articles week this publication worth my time read . many publications dummy down business make it too simple leaving out important details , nuiances important , just assume reader isn't intelligent . articles written concise , generally filled data support their conclusions . i found this magazine invaluable business school because it kept me up date , often ahead my classmates . business world i find this magazine one few keep me informed well rounded aspects business i am not familiar . i really feel this worthwhile publication if you looking stay top what current important business world .	1
before i begin , there one thing you need know : i can't cook . i skills can't beaten when it comes heating stuff microwave , i use toaster oven , uh , toast things , but that it . no whipping up any fancy 30-minute meals me , which probably makes me only person who can't cook who actually buys this magazine . this should say great deal just how entertaining every day rachael ray actually . course , you might expect , i like rachael ray . it really would weird someone buy this magazine if they didn't cook they also hated rachael , i'm not weird ! however , although this ostensibly cooking-centric magazine , i'd argue it really reflects rachael attitude personality . her enthusiasm , love wide variety food , adventurous spirit shine through every page . all reports , rachael very hands-on developing this magazine , it shows . those who ask why they need read rachael ray magazine , since rachael all over television these days ( most recently her own syndicated daytime talk show ) , chew this : rachael isn't taking over world accident . she obviously doing something right dominating both food network daily schedule bestseller lists ( her ever-increasing line cookbooks ) . people just can't get their fill her ! so , what exactly her secret ? i think it boils down these factors : combination approachability charisma , which key ingredients superstardom ( think talented-yet-friendly stars such tom hanks or shakira ) . add dash optimism mixed spirit adventure , witnessed my favorite ray show , " $40 day , " which she explores new tourist destination each week , trying eat well insanely low budget . but what rachael ray magazine form , you're wondering ? well , my opinion , every day rachael ray appeals all tastes brilliantly translating her unique appeal tv screen printed page . i mentioned earlier , i probably won't cooking anything many recipes included each issue , but i still like checking them out . each recipe includes picture finished product , recipes lots variety creativity ... yum-o ! some so simple , like sandwiches or salads , i get feeling i might actually able attempt them if i really wanted ( see ? rachael " can-do " attitude even gets through kitchen-incompetent ! ) travel articles short pieces ( wide range topics such buying cheese , making mistakes kitchen , etc . ) also fun . but , rachael fan , i especially enjoy parts magazine written , or , rachael . one nice feature which readers send questions rachael which she personally answers . someone who participated lot " celebrity a " online past , i love these chances get know more someone famous who you may never meet person . fact , only reason i haven't rated every day rachael ray " five stars " because i'd like see even more rachael-related photos articles each issue ... how cool would ?! also , i'm hungry more interactivity : perhaps some food-themed sudoku , or some search-a-words . but fair , this relatively new magazine , all great magazines need time sort out what doesn't work . so far , every day rachael ray hit ground running off great start . i actually first person buy very first issue my local bookstore when it came out ( i got lucky happened there they set up display ) , i've looked forward each new issue ever since day . if you like rachael ray , you can't go wrong here ... start spending every day rachael ray " take bite outta life .

i'm one those people who always looks up product reviews before buying anything , so it leap faith i bought natural health magazine without reading anything it . friend suggested it , since this particular friend never led me wrong before , i caved bought july/august 2005 copy immediately . let me start off saying i'm extremely picky person . i extremely high standards every purchase i make , i absolutely not cut manufacturer any slack if i find fault . now i've gotten out way , i mention i thoroughly impressed natural health . long ago , i subscribed new age magazine ( now known body soul , which i not care ) . it among my favorites solely due its wide variety content true-to-focus natural lifestyle tips advice . i cannot stand redundancy , incorrect information excessive advertising . i found natural health much more long lines former new age magazine , filled dozens little gems make it worth much more than $3.95 i paid . give you idea what magazine includes , here small sampling articles i found july/august issue : small articles include : - " bee or not bee " , breakdown aromatherapy ingredients include bee pollen , royal jelly , propolis , honey , stating just how effective natural these ingredients . - " how i get relief pms ? " experts ( including naturopath , gynecologist dietitian ) answer this question excellent responses . - " medicine cabinet : attack weekend warrior " natural remedies aids those like myself who love weekend warriors . - " clothes pose " great yoga gear ! - " medical breakthroughs " - " healing supplements : 8 ways beat anxiety " - " fitness fix - knee savers " longer articles include : - " healthy appetites : savvy strategies eating well " delicious , healthy recipes tips . - " good medicine : clean , healthy mouth " well-researched article " mercury fillings , fluoride toothpaste best at-home remedies " . - " five paths peace " five simple meditation techniques . - " eat beat heat : yin foods " more great recipes ! - " sacred spaces " - making your home your personal retrea t.t his only sampling ; fact , that less than half magazine alone . some articles fairly short , but provide just right amount information get point across . my personal favorite last page , " make one change " , where this month change " upgrade your z " . it included simple tips i able implement immediately . amount advertising seemed slightly less than usual ( probably same amount you'd find yoga journal , but not nearly many oprah magazine ) , they seemed line natural health focus . judging past reviews natural health , it seems magazine bad run 2003-2004 timeframe . let remember magazines change editors frequently . i found none past complaints true this issue , but may not so future issues years now . me , i want subscription asap	1

i discovered this " magazine " while employed reference instructional librarian culinary college . four annual hardcover issues arrive just one ad - back cover . recipe quantities typically family size rather than mass serving quantities . this important note because this magazine very much oriented towards professional or very advanced amateur chef . profiles articles tend focus needs professional . one patron ( local sous chef who graduated different culinary school some years earlier ) began swearing blue streak after thumbing through few issues . when i confronted him outburst , he apologized explained his behavior . three years , he worked under local chef amazed creativity chef coming up new recipes restaurant . after thumbing through issues , my patron realized ugly truth - their entire menu cribbed art culinaire . when i told him i my disposal large stack subscription forms , he immediately took one saying , " next time , i'll ahead him .

this magazine doesn't come out regular basis like most mags ... so they don't need fill it up junk articles make it press . it explains how amazing things seen current films . often more explained picture than whole page words , so they quite few high quality pictures ... they also assume least little bit knowledge industry , so they don't explain easy stuff :) i think this most important , they treat productions objectivly ... no reviews , or off handed comments story line or acting ... if you want stuff buy premire ! i haven't yet found mag goes this depth films , without feeling like you getting sales pitch film company	1
