my first culinary memory involves surreptitious finger dip into marmite jar age three ; it first food i remember really loving . ever since then i difficulty getting enough it . not everyone reacts it same way . some imagine it looks too much like axle grease . others complain it smells too much like beer left overnight go bad . these facts suggest one might only serve it close friends only when there some alternatives . any case , marmite claim " love it or hate it " quite apropos . it rarely evokes neutral reaction . best preparation i think mix it thoroughly butter . one part marmite two or three parts butter . then spread thinly toast . served this way , primary flavor marmite salt . then there subtle meaty flavor sometimes called umami - it flavor present well browned mushrooms or red meat . label suggests it might put excellent use soup stocks substitute or supplement caramelized roasted vegetables - onions carrots . nutritional value , even spread thinly it dynamite . those who fall hopelessly its charms may find themselves consuming mega-doses few crucial vitamins . it exceptionally rich source b12 , folicin , b6 . since it free animal products it ideal food include vegan diet which normally falls short delivering b12 .	1

i hearing steel-cut oatmeal benefits eating it quite sometime now . this my first time ever trying this i must say i am extremely impressed . now , i haven't tried any other brands , but i definitely would recommend this brand . i received my order rather quickly ( within week ) . amount oats i received price amazing . 70oz huge . great thing this product you don't use lot it one produce sizeable meal . i believe suggested serving size 1/4 cup uncooked . it may not look like lot initially before cooking , but after it cooks it swells considerably . oh yeah , get this ... i am type 2 diabetics usually foods like foods such rice , oatmeal pasta cause my blood sugars spike . thereafter i feel sluggish until my insulin kicks regulate my sugar levels ( maybe i am telling too much my personal business .. lol ) . not this . i don't know what it ( maybe it my mind ) , but my body seem process this differently . try it	1

easy sprouter great vertical sprouter . seeds or beans go into inner cup drainage holes . inner cup sets outer cup which catches any dripping water still allows air circulation around inner cup all sides . maintaining your growing sprouts ( most seed types ) means holding inner cup under running water least thirty seconds , allowing excess water drain off , setting inner cup back outer cup . doing this two or three times day makes sure growing sprouts remain fresh enough avoid spoiling , moist enough not dry out , but never remaining standing water . most seeds need pre-soaked initially , this step managed directly easy sprouter . there three lids : two lock into place - one air holes , one without . third domed , but doesn't actually lock onto cup . comparison , sprouting canning jars requires jar filled emptied several times each rinsing , draining sufficiently not always easy . sprout master , which sprouting tray i love , allows similar rinsing , but seeds must soaked different container then transfered sprout master . sprout master allows growing plants slightly more light because it width rather than height , but difference slight . i've mostly used my easy sprouter leafy sprout salad mixes ( alfalfa , clover , etc ... ) these varieties take week grow . variety lids sprouter it very flexible . i haven't tried sprout while traveling , but i'm confident it would work well . it works storing your grown sprouts fridge advertised , but i usually take them out sprouter break up clumps before serving put any left-overs into different container . i use my easy sprouter nearly constantly , my sprout master mini trays . i currently second easy sprouter order	1

only refined sugar this brownie mix chocolate chips ; otherwise , it naturally sweetened . it easier put together than mundane supermarket brands : add one egg , butter or oil ( or applesauce , if you're oil-free person ) , little water . throw it 350-degree oven 20 minutes . that it . i'm active home cook rather intense one ( we make our own vanilla , roast our own coffee beans ) , so it no surprise i'd say results aren't good homemade . but they _very_ good . i could put mix together innings while watching baseball game . how _that_ easy ? i'll making this mix again	1

i bought these cherry bars so i'd something snack office . i've bought lot different breakfast/nutrition bars grown used boredom , disappointment , sore jaw muscles when i chew them . i no high expectations these , but i liked my first one so much i promptly unwrapped ate second . i wanted make sure i didn't just think it good compared all horrible or boring bars i've eaten , but it actually good . it . don't get me wrong , fresh chocolate chip cookie better , but chocolate chip cookie isn't reasonable snack its own , either . so these things healthy ? total fat 9g , which 6g monounsaturated 3g polyunsaturated . none trans fat . total carbohydrate 24g , which 4g fiber 17g sugar . protein 5g . no sodium , no cholesterol , 240mg potassium . ingredients dates , almonds , cherries . that it . it uncooked , vegan , kosher . healthy ? not substitute lunch daily basis not if you can't any sugar your diet , but much better than candy bar or cookie , quite good if your diet generally balanced . fact , i think they're excellent snack both taste nutritional perspective . apple pie flavor also excellent . my wife doesn't much care chocolate coconut chew , but i like it quite lot , i'm chocolate snob . oh , this important - my kids like them . my son comes over my office after school , he always used want something my candy bowl . i now keep bowl full almonds pecans , but he likes these bars so much he hasn't complained disappearing candy	1
