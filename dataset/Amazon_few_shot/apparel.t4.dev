cheaper variety walmart ( $8.92 versus $19 up ) , no boundaries brand , better me due fact they harder more firm , more like birkenstock cork sole which i also find very comfortable , me anyway . they last longer too not affected heat any way . walmart also real color explosion going . you get some really wild color combinations which give shoe little personality those occasions when you feel need express yourself . so , cheaper price walmart offers , i feel value quality exceeds more expensive brands out there . if you looking firm birkestock type sole , no boundaries brand croc shoe-in , no pun intended .	-1

slippers themselves good quality unlike many current styles flatter level ( which i like ) . they not built-in arch support ( i not like built-in arch supports so this plus me ) . they washable which plus because my opinion too many slippers marketed today not washable i not purchase slippers i cannot wash . even sizing appropriately my opinion , you should able order whatever slipper size you comfortable without concern . only drawback ( it big drawback ) plastic cords inserted into product keep them together : one inserted incorrectly result plastic could not totally removed . because i cannot wear slippers . plastic inserted through bottom middle slipper after removing plastic we discovered portion it coming up through slipper bed there no way remove it . so , if you're looking decent slippers these fulfill but quality control plastic inserts might pose problem . frustrating but product itself five-star .	1

when i first saw dress , it $18 , then next day it $22 . they would not sell it me $18 , lady phone said it might even go up higher . i bought red blue . then , week later , they went back down $18 before i received dresses . dresses not look like picture site . dress longer than site . site shows it above knee , two i received , below knee , almost mid-calf ... i'm 5'9 . it " halter " top . site , i think they just rested straps over her shoulders not tie behind her next . also , i knew dress cotton , not t-shirt cotton sundress . now , i two dresses i'm not really happy w/ . i haven't time return them . i bought them looking sundress wear out ... this , i would probably only wear beach cover up or pool . haven't decided . once i get around getting post office , i plan returning them . i keep trying them , thinking , " ok , it only $20 , i should keep them . " but i most probably would not bought them if i tried them store . they would look cute if they shorter , but more money i would spend shorten dress . so it really worth it ??? haven't decided yet . fact i can't decided what w/ them , makes me believe i need return them . if i loved them , i would already worn them , but i haven't . only nice thing i say , pattern colors ( both red blue ) really pretty . i would happy if dresses above knee , not t-shirt cotton . very disappointed .	-1

some reason , parasols photosensitive hard find -- most hideously expensive not very good looking . house rice silk parasol , however , exception rule . they manage pretty , useful surprisingly sturdy . except white , painted handle , parasol frame entirely made bamboo . it looks fragile , but surprisingly sturdy , especially since it bound together colorful threads bamboo pegs . over asemi-transparent pale yellow silk canopy , matching ribbon top hang it . how it stand up sun ? well , silk technically transparent , but when unfolded it provide certain amount shade -- same pair sunglasses . aesthetically , it also very good , simple unadorned except few extra scraps silk , but very elegant understated . only problem keep parasol open , you essentially shove it up onto jutting wedge bamboo . it bit pain close . house rice silk parasol meant look pretty , but it also used parasol origina function . definitely good find , if you get it closed easily	1
