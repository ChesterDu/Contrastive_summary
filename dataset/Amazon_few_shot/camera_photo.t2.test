i bought this monopod 3 weeks ago after reading reviews here . i'm not sure if i got defective unit but i've these problems gitgo : -i noticed 2 lower sections not open close smoothly , they would get stuck 2-3 inches lock you'd need force expand/retract them . very interestingly , if section right above one i'm trying expand/retract unlocked then operation smooth flawless ! -the ballhead not support my nikon d80 lightest lens ( 18-55mm ) less than 2 lbs combo , which much lighter than 4.4 lbs weight limit indicated specs . camera just slumps one direction or regardless how hard i try make sure ballhead locked tightly . again , it might defective unit , but i thought i'd point my observations out anyway . i wanted buy this amazon , it wasn't stock , it sitting my shopping cart when it became available amazon bumped price $40+ , so i went elsewhere got it $30 .	1
last march ( 2002 ) i bought this camera it wonderful , although it " refurbished " canon it worked perfectly . i bought also new battery 48mb compactflash memory card everything working fine . 6 months later camera electrical problems warranty expired . now cost fix this problem far bigger than buy new camera because warranty period " refurbished " items less than 6 months	-1

it looks great , genuine leather , much better than synthetic . like brand named leather wallet . but there no where you tie case camera . hence you hold onto it hand when you pull camera out take photos . there no where put essential accessories ( battery memory stick ) . there no way clip belt . like return if if not hassle mailing associated cost . bought handy synthetic case afterwards	1

great features , right ? i just returned it after very disappointing results . here just few issues : 1 . if you use tripod ( you need ) , you can't plug ac adapter save short battery life , because mounting it tripod covers access ac connection . 2 . battery life very short . 3 . if you want protect lens , you need buy lens adapter then buy protective lens . 4 . you can't take still photos flash if you using lens adapter because adapter casts shadow flash onto your pictures . 5 . automatic settings horrible . auto focus , auto white balance , auto anything give you worst results if shooting indoors . 6 . you cannot adjust manual focus or anything else once you begin recording . 7 . quality very poor when recording indoors without enormous amount light . save your money . buy camera better features . i am waiting panasonic hdc-sd1 due march	-1
i bought sd300 take me touring motorcycle . it so small , i just put it belt case always it . appropriate sd card i take huge number pictures high quality setting . pictures turn out great , but . eight months after i bought it , lcd screen suddenly went all crazed when turned , tho there no visible damage . i returned it repair , no problem , no expense , it back two weeks . less than 3 months later , same thing . i know i not drop or bump it , it went down 10 minutes showing some pictures one person , then , indoors . i called , told it still under warranty previous repair , got return label . then i got e-mail saying i would pay $97 repairs lcd screen caused impact damage . i replied e-mail protest , ignored . i finaly called , told tho warranty still force , this damage not covered . checking aroun web , i found this common problem , not damage . unfortunately , i already authorized repair when i found this out , so i guess i am stuck . i several canon products , not buy any more	1
ok , i hasty this purchase . first glance it seemed small price pay camera case ... $14 , shipping included . then i got camera case found dimensions somewhat lacking space requirement camera i ordered . you see , dimensions listed under " more details " outside case , not inside ( but it doesn't say interior nor exterior , just gives dimensions ) . turns out , not only you click " more details , " ( fine print ) you also click " more technical details . " ( finer print ) wish i now . just wasted $9 shipping 6 oz camera case . electrogalaxy not refund shipping charges , they charge %20 restocking fee . so , most , after i pay return shipping , ( case only $4 ) i might get back $2 . so , yeah i hasty , but i also robbed	-1

i bought this camera after my 3-year-old broke my kodak z700 . i loved my z700 , even though it only 4mp didn't lot features newer cameras . i figured buying newer kodak model upgrading 6mp would no-brainer , but i disappointed 2 major areas . first , lag time so slow c653 , when i took pictures my kids i rarely got what i expecting see . smile or look i saw when flash went long gone time it captures . we experimented tons settings there no difference . other disappointing area low-light picture quality . anything i shot indoors grainy except where flash hit . every background grainy . terrible . using low-light settings fixed problem , but then your subject blurry because you're not " sports " or " kids " mode anymore ( which we used all time z700 taking pics kids ) . my z700 ( which only $150 now ) , i could set it forget it . set it " action " , it took perfect pics indoors , or out , moving or stationary . that what i thought i getting c653 , but i wrong . i ended up returning camera	1
if you're looking capture " decisive moment " nikon coolpix 8400 , stop --- not buy this camera !!! matter , carefully check any digicam or other camera which you want capture " action , " because what you think you see , may not what camera ability capture image . let me briefly explain where i'm coming : i made my living field photojournalist 40 years . time i retired out business i probably created something like million color bw film images . i owned used mostly nikon equipment all those years ( although i sure liked working leica rangefinder cameras short focal length lenses ) , starting original nikon slr ( which i still ) finishing up n90s probably ten different lenses varying focal lengths . i like nikon equipment lot . i decided begin working digital images last year . i attracted coolpix 8400 because " spread " zoom lens 35mm camera equivalent 24mm -- 85mm . when i worked film i probably used my 24mm 105mm nikkors more than any others my bag , so this little coolpix beauty just what i looking one package . let me say while problems viewfinder shutter lag make this camera absolutely useless editorial photojournalism , it , nevertheless , marvel human ingenuity . many other uses --- such taking pictures fire hydrants or cows standing pasture ( put way , things don't move ) , it works wonderfully well . seriously , i shot assignment here tucson essentially architectual nature . images only described superb ( if i say so myself ) . i worked only camera tripod shoot . working inside i simply changed light balance within menu 8400 ( which you pretty much any digital camera these days ) , not check scene separate exposure meter , etc . point film i often carried bunch light balancing filters sometimes separate gossen exposure meter all sorts lights shoot assignment . even then , i'd sweat blood until i could get processed film light table . course digital , i ( you ) don't worry any stuff . one check image immediately know instantly if you're good go . alas , shutter lag this , many other digital cameras made these days , " downcheck " which makes me unable recommend 8400 . there also delay electronic viewfinder deal . combination shutter viewfinder lag make it absolutely impossible capture image , precise composition which lasts only split-second . i taken many good pictures people working , " action " shots like , but it only taking large numbers images any given activity then retaining one or two said what i intended i achieved my purpose . essentially , my shooting eye ( which pretty damned good ) nothing it . it like soldier trying kill enemy machine-gun --- if he fires enough rounds , one them going hit other guy . marksmanship nothing it . same-same shooting electronic viewfinders shutter lag . if you shoot enough images , statistically you're probably going get good one . but it not very good way things . so if you're looking capture what henri cartier-bresson ( i'm not sure i've spelled his name correctly ) so artfully described " decisive moment , " look digital single-lens reflexes , or wait improvements digicams .	1
i used canon elura 70 , which excellent camcorder but firewire transfer didn't work so i decided replace it elura 100 only find canon discontinued elura line . i really wanted elura improved video quality over low-end zr models . so compromise i purchased zr 850 which 1mp ccd , not good elura ( 1.3 mp ) but better than other zr ( . 640mp ) . video quality wasn't bad but motor noise so loud i couldn't believe it . i returned first one but replacement just bad . this isn't minor hum background i'm talking , its full-on whine ! i also found zr camera difficult handle my small-ish hands video stabilisation bit disappointing . luckily i could return both cameras without incurring restocking fee found reconditioned elura 100 much more satisfactory . its mystery me how canon produce two markedly different cameras ( quality wise ) same price range opt phase out better one	1
i bought this frame display pictures my newborn daughter my desk work . i didn't really high expectations it , because it so inexpensive . soon it turned i following problems : 1 ) five seconds after i turn it , it always says " usb connected !

this battery backwards compatible d50 , d70/70s , used d80 d200 . so if you any nikon dslr want second battery , you want get this one so when you upgrade your camera you use battery . this battery built-in circuitry tells you actual charge status battery , it accurate . this big deal ; * if you using d200 or d80 * it lets you know when your really need switch batteries or charge up . this first battery i've seen accurate this regard . kudos nikon . ( this feature not work d50/70/70s but battery otherwise works fine )	1

never ending race larger larger megapixel counts , d70s fallen behind pack . ( however , if that only measure which you're judging digital camera - you really should consider further research before plunking down several hundred dollars . ) nevertheless , it quite good camera . what i like it most : - it looks feels solid . some reviewers pan this camera feeling flimsy plasticky apparently still stuck realm pro cameras cost several thousand dollars . it not bulletproof titanium box you back hummer over , but it certainly seems outdo dslrs it category . - very good battery life . - backwards compatibility decade worth nikon slr lenses . my gripes : - latch keeps pop-up flash place broke less than week . - inability meter through older manual focus lenses . - lack full functionality flashes other than sb-600 sb-800 . - nikon raw software control software aren't included camera , imho overpriced . ( ... top , nikon split what used one overpriced software package into two overpriced software packages ... ) what would improve this camera most : - iso 100 iso 3200+ - ability store multiple custom white balance presets , then pull them up fly . - replacing " idiot modes " ( i.e. " portrait " , " landscape " , etc . ) modes you could customize	1
this replacement battery half cost canon yet offers longer life . i bought it when i first got my sd10 . when one battery runs out , spare goes . lenmar still works great while canon near end life ! i am buying two more since they so cheap ! not buy no name batteries ebay . they not last worth darn basically waste money ! don't it ..	1
just returned trip hawaii opportunity put this lens test . i very pleased results . this powerful lens , yet it relatively light weight not burdensome use . i able get some really amazing wild life shots birds , zooming distance hand held camera ( canon eos 20d ) virtually every shot keeper . feature allows you quickly zoom compose your shot fire it off image quality excellent sharp focus . usually lens this size this much power requires firm grip almost always tripod - not so this one . i shot both portrait landscape mode i didn't see any problems focus , clarity or sharpness . all images clean razor sharp . if you looking long lens ability bring distant shot without use tripods other equipment , i highly recommend this lens your arsenal .	1
i am not photographer , but i enjoy taking good pictures . i never digital slr before ; camera i before d50 nikon coolpix ( compact one ) . i thought this would good camera someone who enjoys good pictures without pro . i realized it even better than what i expected ( maybe because i coming nikon coolpix ) . colors amazing quality picture extremely good . d50 among cheapest digital slr , , same time , it very serious product . i don't think d50 much inferior canon rebel , even if canon 2 more megapixels resolution . i used both d50 ( which i own ) rebel ( my school ) i think d50 feels much more like " pro camera " when you hold it your hands , while rebel feels more like toy . lenses provided package good , but basic . according me 18-55 better than 28-80 , but i think i should bought 55-200 well : 18 200 covers most pictures you take . also 18-135 nikon sells d80 looks good me , but they don't make kit those lenses d50 . last thing really amazes me . nef format ( nikon raw format ) . it impressive how quickly you improve . nef picture your computer just very few clicks mouse . if you want good camera , you don't want spend too much money it i think this best choice	1

i bought this camera august . it really well made controls easy navigate . i think it takes really good pictures , inside outside . who cares video quality ? its camera , not camcorder , lady . i think it really nice camera . its really durable too . it looks nice . i would buy it again . i researched bunch cameras before this one i chose sony end . its one step up just taking everyday pictures . they look really pro . i'd buy it again	1
i lot research before buying this camera . we could bought higher quality digital camcorder less or higher quality minidv camcorder same price . what led our final decision purchase this camcorder fact we could record straight 8cm dvd-r , finalize disc camcorder , play it directly our dvd player or dvd-rom player our computer . we didn't want deal sticking cables wires into tv , electrical outlet , camera playback footage . we also didn't want deal cost trouble transferring footage onto dvds keep our video library future . those you who like edit , re-record , create effects , etc ., you need purchase special software separately , but dvd-ram disc , you ease convenience doing it all your dvd-rom your computer . you also download it usb cable , but it nice able just pop it dvd drive get started . if you only interested playback , dvd-r discs sufficient ; however , you can't erase or record over footage dvd-rs , only dvd-rw dvd-ram discs . picture quality camera adequate . it isn't grainy , but smooth actually very nice right lighting , especially outside sunny day . it doesn't built-in light , so you aware right surroundings environment recording . i would give picture quality 3.75 out 5 . if you want better quality , you need buy more expensive dvd camcorder . considering how far we come over years home video technology , it definitely beats those days images out focus grainy . you can't compare it tv movie camera quality , but i think it pretty darn good home videos . zoom good , but course it takes some time focus if you zoom or out too quickly . stabilizer pretty good , but i keep it off most part get better picture quality . if you plan move around lot , use function , but expect lose little quality process . what basically happens when using stabilizer ( most cameras , i believe ) image movements slightly delayed . sound quality adequate , but if you recording when it windy , you pick up lot wind sounds unless you block microphone your hand . only problem i so far discs . we bought panasonic dvd-rw discs can't get them play our computer or our dvd player . we ended up purchasing sony dvd-r discs they play no problem . when i called panasonic their dvd-rw discs , they didn't good answer . representative told me make sure dvd-rw discs compatible my players . i told her they may not compatible my dvd player , but it should my new computer software . representative just repeated herself eventually said there isn't any difference sony panasonic discs ( interesting ) . they make claim panasonic discs work best manual , but now i know better . overall , this camcorder great value ( you can't beat price this dvd technology ) , average good quality picture functions , excellent ease convenience dvd playback storage , really easy use .	1
shooting dslr great lot ways , but sensor crop kills my wide-angle capability , which , me , absolutely awful ! personally , i hate zoom lenses . i've got full set nikon primes . while i'd prefer prime lens , these zoom lenses only game town wide angle crop sensor dslr . i like this lens because it goes wide digital . i suggest you buy this lens 10mm keep it 10mm because 10mm wide end really where it reason buy this lens over alternatives . anybody considering 10mm vs 12mm wide end , unless you mostly use narrower end focal length most time , 2mm significant difference field view short lenses . focal length increases ( eg , 400mm 600mm ) , difference angle view not very large . but difference 10mm 12mm even though " only 2mm " no laughing matter , if you don't believe me , you comparison camera shop prove it yourself . if you end up deciding get 12mm , you want buy sigma 12mm ( i think it 12-24mm ? ) because lens covers full 35mm frame ( angle view got absolutely amazing) ! also , if sigma or nikon reads this review , please make 8mm or 9mm 2.8 rectilinear crop sensor prime ! if sigma reads this review , i want some 1.2 or 1.0 afd primes ! 50mm film maybe even digital sensor version some medium range focal length ! i would definitely buy ( full frame coverage course ) mid length medium wide angle short tele ! neither nikon nor canon makes anything like ( well , canon kind does/did ) , so you'd market segment dominated	1
this digital camera best . i cannot complain any aspect it . it huge amount modes settings additional features add pictures you taking them . it small enough fit into your pocket not think it ( it smaller than wallet ) . it takes excellent pictures come out looking great , all very high quality . huge screen makes it easy view what you looking great image quality . videos equally good , great sound good picture . it looks better than just any other digital camera i seen . even though i said i cannot complain , there few things slightly annoy me occasionally . first it flashes twice . remember tell this people before taking their picture ! after first flash , people tend look away , time second flash comes picture taken , moment lost . this only occurs when camera set " auto " mode . i usually press menu button choose mode . when you this , flashes occur very quickly ( you barely notice gap them ) . some features very useful . i use " backlight " mode quite often . it allows you take picture something even if there bright light background . my only other complaint those us large fingers , circular button operates pretty much every feature difficult use ( sometimes i push 2 buttons once , or complete wrong one ) . but everything else this camera cancels it out . this camera more features better quality than many larger more expensive cameras out there	1
i bought this sweet little thing because i am planning day nyc don't want bring my regular camera , which bulky . this camera nice small would fit any purse or coat pocket . it 5 mp 3x optical zoom which great price . pictures i took outside turned out outstanding . inside pics bit pixelated , but i may settings wrong . camera easy use right out box . perfect second camera keep you just case	1

i needed camera bag greater portability , comfort , security athletic venues well outdoors ( i.e. mountains , valleys , trails , etc . ) this bag delivered . i fit my two primary lenses , telephoto , external flash , colapsing tripod my camera room spare . i even attach my monopod side if needed . i like pockets so extra internal zipper pockets plus exterior side front pockets great tucking away all extras too ; like lense cleaning suplies , batteries , memory cards . backing shoulder straps nicely padded so it wears comfortably well . when i purchased backpack i planned only use it more " active outings " but since found myself using it place my original camera bag	1
bought this lens few months back shot volleyball it , occasionally used it football when it got dark . what i say or add other reviews ?? f/ 1.8 great , although lens sharper f/2 or 2.2 . i use it near wide open edge all time - indoor gyms simply not much ligh t.t he usm autofocus great - demoing it store , it seemed nearly anticipate my actions . no rotating front filter , it doesn't protrude , either . it got full time manual focus ring , so i don't worry killing my autofocus motor . combination . fn 4-1 , this killer . why four stars ? chromatic aberration lower apertures . i not know where it starts go away , because i almost never shoot good light . this most apparent shot recent football game . granted , team jerseys white , background pitch black unlit parking lot , i perform 100% crop . nevertheless , alien-like purple halo surrounded huddled offensive team . oh well , you can't it all ! volleyball pics , this lens . i regularly shoot f/ 2.2 , iso 1600 , 1/500 , but i might change soon because pushing it . photos pretty sharp usm definitely helps here . i bought this lens because my 50mm 1.8 just wasn't cutting it - i'd get shots tack sharp background beautifully bokeh'd subject - just opposite what it should . using 85mm removed 85% those shots . there still extreme instances when i swing my camera around instantly shoot when usm can't keep up , but there other instances when i am amazed it got shot focus . sidelines , 85mm too long get outside hitter nearest you , but that why you move around ! shooting volleyball requires strategy . focal length also good my 350d shooting events staying bit back subject . i'm overall pretty pleased lens . i see what many people call this " hidden lens .	1
this lens bag fine product but don't fooled into adding it accessory canon 1.4 or 2x extenders . both them come this exact pouch . amazon should remove this " suggested accessory " web pages two products above	1
i'll spare technical review 580ex flash now . i've using this new flash on-the-go shootings find it very helpful especially capabilities using multi flash units off-shoe mode . it great hard reach places where i want produce more light or fast moving subjects , i.e. wedding guests fast pets . i plan pick up least 2 more these units it compatibility most part . not only i get good light coverage subjects , but possibilities making more interesting artistic photographs defines my work . still nothing beats use higher end lighting kits like profoto acute systems . but that alot lug around .	1
i digital cameras 5 years still own olympus 5 megapixel , casio 7 megapixel . seems like megamixels alone just don't cut it me . i read rebel xt magazine looked up user reviews here amazon . i decided go buy one though i am really novice , i am extremely impressed . i never seen such stunning quality or realistic colors point shoot . i started basic settings love results . i am slowly progressing more advanced settings am getting better everyday . even novice who just wants stunning photography amazed this camera . i also bought tamron 75-300 autofocus zoom lens ( look it here amazon.com ) after lots practice , able take some great pictures . i brother uk who also into digital photography , after seeing some ( full reso ) photos i sent him , he rushed out bought xti ( called eos 400d across pond)and amazed it . i still lot learn but really cannot fault this camera . included software also excellent . record , some reviews seem think it too small hold , i big hands don't any problems all . i admit though this first slr i ever owned . i still keep point shoot keep my travel bag spontaneous photography but i am love my rebel xt !! this camera costs quite chunk change but i think it well worth it i recommend it everyone	1
this camera amazing , i couldn't asked more . just warned manual pretty terrible . it best just play around camera until you figure it out , rather than wasting time trying decipher manual	1
when this lens used 1.6 camera body such xt , 20d , or 30d it ends up giving you amazing 288mm macro or you go one step further 1.4 or 2x tc make it 403/576mm super power . course whenever doing this you must either use tripod or flash except blazing light . it little slow focus compared many other lenses canon offers , but since you most likely using manual focus lot time anyway , this not huge drawback . it also gets heavy carry after few hours you people ask you questions both your their cameras . good note parents pretty good keeping small children out your way when you this lens mounted . narrower background compared 60mm or 100mm macro lenses makes cluttered areas easier deal . extra working distance also plus when working wary insects etc . it best use shutter release mirror lockup shutter speeds longer than 1/30 if you want sharp pictures . 60mm macro wins convenience , but absolute clarity improved working distance 180 comes out top	1
first all it took me few months decide what lens buy because i so much research . my choices canon 70-200l 4 , 70-200l 2.8 70-200l 2.8 . after much investigation i opted not buy 4.0 because i knew i would shooting dim lights needed 2.8 . so save money i bought 2.8 non . lens great i travelled utah it . all great until i tried shoot deer full zoom . every one came out blurry could not use . apart it fantastic lens . result i decided fork out 2.8 lens it amaizing . it same optics non but handheld really works great . like some reviews it not make every shot focus but certainly most them picture quality amaizing . fast focus , great colours . fantastic . if you afford it buy it def worth it because lens heavy you shake bit , which noticeable full or close full zoom . hope this helps	1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
there very little doubt this one better canon lenses available . however , why buy amazon when it price increase $73 soon canon starts 2006 fall rebate program . amazon officially become most expensive online retailer this lens .	1
well , it canon , so there no doubt quality . only downside -- because it doesn't string cap very easy misplace . always put it your pocket everytime you remove it camera shoot pictures	1
other reviewers complained plastic foot flash-bracket end cracking or breaking off . solution metal " sacrificial foot " screws into 1/4 " -20 threads bottom . bogen/manfrotto 3298 ( bo3298 ) works perfectly . no amazon vendor carries it this date , but you find it bhphotovideo.com . their listing says it nikon , but it works canon off camera shoe cord 2 well	1
someone make sense this me please ? """ smaller maximum aperture , smaller lighter lens . """ wtf ? anyway ... it affordable range those us real world explore . it gets 4 stars price vs usability joe soaps jane like me out there	1

case made high quality material fits my canon powershot a700 perfectly . i would given it 5 stars if case seperate compartment carrying extra set batteries . there just enough room carry camera extra memory chip . no extra batteries .	1
after noting captions exceptional photographs appeared nature photography magazines often shot this lens , i began read reviews . based uniformly excellent reviews , i bought this lens spent two weeks this january florida everglades taking pictures birds . based upon my experience lens , i would rate this second sharpness contrast only 300 mm 2.8 canon series lens . lens handholdable short periods shoot birds flight , but it best suited use solid tripod wimberley tripod head allow tracking birds flight	1
i didn't think it would , but this lens winds up my rebel xt most time . lens compact performs well indoors low light - best use autofocus set center point only . 35mm focal length nice general purpose focal length 1.6 crop dslr . this lens sharp 2.0 really sharp 2.5 -f 2.8 . i lot experience test my lenses tripod/mirror lockup , i'm not just saying sharp 2.0 - it sharp . i considered 24mm 2.8 , but 2.8 pretty slow prime wider focal lengths - loses lot low light advantage . i am impressed colors i getting this lens , wasn't really expecting colors so good such low price point - doesn't lens coatings , but canon colors righ t.t he autofocus speed pretty good - not fast ring usm lenses - it little noisy/buzzy . i currently own 7 canon lenses ( 2 ls ) including 4 primes - this 35mm definitely top bang-for-the-buck lens . ( 28-105 3.5 - 4.5 usm zoom - i don't even like zooms)looking low-light prime ? 240 bucks amazon - just it	1

i initially canon s1is ( just 3mp , 10x optical , cf card ) needed upgrade same i visiting disney , la . s3is ( 6 mp , sd card ) delivered gusto its image stabilization higher iso modes . i full video reasonably good snaps disney parade during evening darkness ( switch highest iso dedicated iso button ) : 1 . amazingly low jerkiness due image stabilization . here course better than s1is . 2 . snaps came allright even maximum zoom - if there slight blurs , you maybe use software like coral adjust . others said here , yes , tripod best , but who time or patience set it up . 3 . even many disney fireworks snaps came out ok night mode maximum iso setting - though course tripod would helped darkness here , sure :) 4 . best value price . nov 2006 , nice deal would getting this camera within 350$ amazon . two things here : 1 . i would not buying videocam i planned earlier , s3is vidoes suffice most situations - sending videos afv instance . 2 . last point , i would recommend waiting 3-4 months till 4gb sd cards come into 50$ range . but others mentioned before , please least 2gb card . look amazon or fry i 35-40$ deals 2+ gb cards	1
i got this canon camera back may my birthday my husband . once i got it home it very easy learn use . i actually not even used all features yet ... because there so many . this my 3rd digital camera 1st canon ... i say i stick canon now ... i use always like kodak but canon much better . i print off pictures using my kodak printer everything still looks great ! i love canon so much i just bought canon camcorder ... i hope it just nice their digital cameras . i highly recommend this camera families ... i used it live action after you get hang image stabilizer everything turns out well ..... i feel i use this camera while when it time upgrade camera i stick w/ canon ..	1
i really looked hard various light ( sub-3 lb ) tripod options use my canon powershot s2 . lighter better , but i also really wanted 3-way pan head all little nice extras i could get : bubble level , quick set-up/tear-down , fits inside carry-on luggage , good build quality , comes bag , good hand crank , etc . it definitely fit bill perfectly , only 2 lbs ! course you don't get super strong wind-proof stability weight , but i really quite happy overall stability my recent vacation . when there strong wind , i leaned bag , backpack , or beach towel around one legs gave me more piece mind ... but i think it probably would fine ... especially when not fully extended max height . before buying it , max height actually my only real concern -- would it tall enough take good people pictures/outdoor portraits while i my vacation ? my experience says -- yes , great people shots ( so much better than typical shot you get asking passing stranger take photo you)!don't hesitate , just buy this one !	1
this camera simply amazing ! i started out canon g2 , then canon g6 , then canon 20d , now this canon 1d mark ii . i debated researched 3 months 1ds mark ii , 5d , 30d . my decision primarily narrowed down 5d this 1d mark ii . yes , i wish this camera full-frame also shared 12.8 mp like 5d , but you know what ? it practically killed me trying weigh pros cons finally i made my decision go this one i'm 110% glad i . me , this camera definitely one get because 45 point focusing , 8.5 fps , 1d pro body/interface/menu/layout , etc what really makes this camera worth it deciding factor . trust me , if you don't know how seriously fast 8.5 fps really , you need go out your camera store try it out before you decide . because this 8.5 fps alone , i'm actually able capture lot shots i normally get lucky getting my 20d . 5d 3fps , i just said forget it ... no way . i'm not even professional taking pictures living . this just purely fun hobby me stepping up 20d this camera out this world . phenomenal auto focusing , additional metering , it like i'm now playing bentley ( 1d mk2 ) coming mercedes c230 hatchback ( cheapest mercedes people buy just because it mercedes name they don't want spend any more money real mercedes ) . this camera photos truly almost help me take pictures like pro . also , i don't shoot action pictures all time , i love portrait photography , landscapes printing blowing up large sized pictures . but even 1.3 crop factor , there still huge improved difference going 1.6 crop you won't vignetting problems some lenses you'll 5d . this 1d mk2 , you still take wonderful wedding photography , landscapes , etc . much i'd like 12.8 mp like 5d , 8mp really all we need these days unless you're going blow up print photos larger than 8x10 or around there . unless you're printing extremely large posters whatnot , you pretty much everything this camera 5d . resolution mp definitely enough . plus , it also invaluable know you 8.5 fps available ready use if you need you also tone it down use slower fps if you need . extra bonuses this camera which i look secondary positive , weather seals , pro-build high quality construction body , easy use navigate menu system , you see iso information viewfinder well lcd screen all times , dual memory card capability , you shoot 2 memory cards same time one backup or use 2 separate cards independently , built-in battery grip ( you don't shell out extra this ) , longer battery life than other cameras , best customization most options you set your liking , more than 5d or 20d or 30d . i could go but definitely get this camera if you afford it . otherwise , 5d also great choice too if you need save money , all you take landscape pictures all day long , or never use fast action or need capture quick moments , don't want fast most accurate focusing system that great ai servo .	1
canon makes great underwater housing reasonable price . i purchased this recent trip grand cayman cozumel . i didn't go scuba diving this trip , but i take camera snorkeling ( diving depths ~ 20ft ) . it worked flawlessly i got some pictures i very happy ! one thing i not anticipate use camera got out water . going ac hot humid outdoors , my eos rebel fogged up ( condensation ) even after 30 minutes i couldn't take good pictures . sd110 uw housing , i just wipped housing glass portal lens tissue after it warmed up couple minutes i able take clear pictures . instructions pretty good , but it took me while figure out how take out o-ring seal cleaning/lubing . once i figured it out , it wasn't so hard . sd110 may getting little old , but it still takes decent pictures even housing i don't so much money tied up system i would devestated if it lost or stolen . i probably upgrade sd550 or sd500 ( they both use same batteries sd110 ) wp-dc80 or wp-dc70 housing some time near future , but i definitely keep sd110 wp-dc10 backups	1
using photoshop , big fan bulb exposures rs60 e3 must accesory . you use it just you would shutter button digital rebel , well lock shutter open , which very good painting small flashlight , etc . my only qualm switch shortness cord , but if you're trying take self portrait remote , then you need get infrared remote . two those combined makes perfect pair tools any remote picture taking needs	1

i use my canon 10d mainly astrophotography . most time , it involves keeping camera shutter open long periods time , anywhere few minutes tens minutes . this ack-e2adapter takes my worries away monitoring battery status or drained one , while i control camera remotely sitting inside my house . continuous power also ensures worry free writes its flashstorage . package included several ac power connectors which very useful while travelling . amazon provides wide range items choose .	1
nikon d50 my fourth digital camera , my first slr camera . i don't know why i didn't try slr earlier , but now i decided i never go back non-slr cameras ( well , i still my other 3 point shoot digital cameras which sometime more convenient carry . ) i guess i'm just trying show how much i like slr camera . now back d50 . unless you shooting sports/actions professionaly ( which then you want buy d2h or d2x faster focusing processor , faster frames per second larger memory buffer ) , d50 pretty much all you need ( equipped several lenses course ) . d50 all pre-configured settings casual photographers ( " child " mode also added d50 , night landscape mode not available ) , it usual , , , mode more serious/advance photographer . i stopped using pre-set mode now strictly uses aperture priority shutter priority mode ( far manual mode , i'm not there yet ) . this shows this camera versatile suitable all ranges skills . comparing its siblings ( d70s , d80 , d200 ) , i think whichever you want buy fine . they all great cameras . it comes down your budget . comparing other brand like canon ( rebel xt or 30d ) , or pentax or sony , it just brand preference ( what lenses you already ) . moreover , if you come point shoot camera user , any slr brand you buy i don't think you dissapointed ( just fact slr performs better most important aspect photography ) image quality d50 good which #1 factor i look digital camera . here pros cons d50 my opinion : pros : 1 . nice out camera result picture quality ( auto setting , pre-programmed setting ) 2 . fit perfectly my hand ( grip nicely ) 3 . instant take picture right away 4 . 2.5 frames per second 5 . large 2 inch lcd 6 . battery life ( take 400-2000 shots single charge depend how often you use full power flash ) 7 . uses sd card 8 . fast usb2 connection 9 . capability copy re-size pictures small size ( great email ) 10 . repeating #1 again . great image quality cons ( which mostly minor ): 1 . no backlight top panel 2 . no black white picture mode 3 . no night landscape mode 4 . no iso 100 ( iso 1600 picture grainy though still usable)5 . no depth-of-field preview button 6 . no front command dial 7 . 1/4000 max shutter speed i started using this camera landscape portrait , but later i started shooting sports/action night ( low light ) settings , hence i added nikon 50mm f/ 1.8 af-d which great prime lens i'm recommending everyone get this " fast " lens . i'm also recommending you get nikon 70-300m f/4- 5.6 af , which nice ( price ) zoom lens . if you budget then go nikon 70-200mm f/ 2.8 vr af-s which i think best zoom lens nikon currently . ( vr really works especially stationary object . if object you want photograph moving low light situation/indoor then you need " fast " lens , i.e. lens large aperture such f/ 2.8 , f/ 1.8 , or f/ 1.4 etc)happy photographing !	1
i bought battery grip , based fact my rebel xt small camera , when using it my last model shoot , someone mentioned it looked like ï¿½tourist cameraï¿½which pretty depressing , since adding grip not only i more than enough battery life my camera , it also pro look people recognize , even though i still believe it not camera , it eye behind it counts , good looking camera always welcome	1
pros : - reduces flare ghosting when shooting bright light . - helps protect your lens dirt scratches . - somewhat protects lens case fall . better break hood than front element . - makes you look more like you know what you doing helps keep others carelessly walking front you . cons : - increase lens movement windy situations , kind like sail boat . - takes up more room your bag , even when reversed they still add diameter lens . - people take more notice you , help blow your cover if you trying keep low profile .	1

i am just hobbyist . this big purchase big step me get into this level camera . i still haven't mastered using it yet , i've it few months . it wonderful job taking pictures . if you right lenses , it take some most beautiful pictures you've ever seen . again , i'm just hobbyist/enthusiast . i use it take pictures work , too . i highly recommend getting couple very good lenses go it . don't go cheap lenses canon , tamron , sigma , etc . make this camera . yourself favor get nice zoom - spend some bucks . you'll happy you . camera itself pretty easy use if you leave it auto , but that like buying race car never shifting out first gear . auto settings great , they wonderful job , but you so much more if you learn use camera manual , av , tv , or mode . it allows you so much more creativity you'll amazed difference . 30d came out right before i bought 20d , i would probably buy it price now , but i'm very happy my 20d	1
those you who d200 wondering if you need this flash consider this . d200 built flash acting commander you use sb800 off camera . just set it up it included stand coordinate flash camera conrols you now ability capture portraits look professional . set it up behind your subject , off side , angle bounce anywhere . i am sure you get idea . just one more reason why nikon great value . think what it would cost you similiar capability your canon . this flash may seem high priced but it most sophisticated unit market my opinion . good luck !	1
this same canon grip , made same factory . i don't know how they get away it , but it consumer gain here . through 2 batteries your over hundred bucks ahead --- spend all those lenses you'll end up getting xti/400d .	1

after reading number on-line reviews , i bought this lens few weeks ago straightly its low-light photography capability . what i gotten little more than i bargained . pictures it produces made casual hobbyist like myself look like pro , least admiring eyes unsuspecting acquaintances . now only if i heart mumble-jumble few far-fetched jargons , i might new packing order firmly place . when paired my rebel xti , 80mm effective focal length wide apertures make it ideal portrait lens . it also compact , light-weigh solidly built , fast acurate auto-focus , most importantly , superb optical qualities . best part i gotten these without breaking bank nor it break my neck hauling it around . however , despite its low-light capability , very attributes make this lens outstanding portraits , i.e. , narrow angle view shallow depth field wide apertures , make it odd choice in-door group photos . also if you taking action shots , 80mm focal length may not long enough provide safe distance avoid mishaps . instead distal observer , i found myself unwilling participant middle action ducking camera ever-curious tongues my golden retriever her playmates . no wonder zoom lenses so popular . what else there not like this lens ? not much unless you proud owner one mammoth expensive prime lens . well , it come free hood wonderful soft leather pouch , doesn't it	1
sima monopod perfect if you're looking something easy carry set up . it exends quickly quick release mount stay attached camera base . stability good , but it not sturdy feel . if you want something solid feel , you move up food chain , but sacrifice compactness light weight this product .	1
it gives proteccion handling you looking . buy it camera no regrets	1
i got these gloves use when taking outdoor photos winter . they work very well , little rubber grips help you better control camera without expose your hands elements . they not really warm enough really cold weather ( below 20 ) , but work well 20-50 degrees	1
i purchased this lens primarily use macro lens . since i shoot mostly wildlife ( including bugs ) i thought field view 160mm ( used my canon rebel xt ) would just ideal . reality fl not enough . i approach bugs much too close they frequently left scene quickly . pictures taken lens extremely sharp bocah ( out focus area behind subject ) very nice . i wound up selling lens ebay since it didn't meet my needs	1
i seen glowing reports this lens several magazines , most notably shutterbug . it truly splendid performer one well worth paying if photographer needs extra working distance afforded macro lens 180mm 200mm range . its performance certainly good , if not better , than nikon venerable 200mm f4 micro nikkor , which one first - if not first - telephoto macro lenses this focal length . this canon lens excels not only macro photography but also nature photography , getting close-up images animals wild without working too close disturb them . if i owned canon equipment , then this lens would essential part my kit	1
i able scout out different case options my sony dsc-n1 . after much review , i asked my wife her opinion she picked lcs-nb . it holds camera nice snug but you could work memory stick or battery . so far , so good	1

canon g6 great camera . i upgraded canon powershot a80 g6 . a80 showed me canon makes good camera , but lacking few features i really wanted . me , this camera perfect collection compromises . i want small camera family snapshots , that easy use . i want large , capable camera art work like portraits landscape , action shots like sports recreation . when i'm vacation , want some snaps kids goofing around or dinner or something , i don't need camera makes me jump through hoops get decent shot , i just want point shoot . full auto , or aperature priority , or shutter speed priority , pictures usually sharp crisp . set image size one medium or small settings you use high speed multi-shot feature get series action shots guarantee you'll get least few good ones . i no qualms setting this camera auto , handing this camera person little or no photgraphic experience , letting them click away . it easy enough learn most folks taking nice pictures less than hour , pros taking great pictures no time all . other hand , lot work i very artistic , involves using manual settings . when going perfect picture , it often necessary adjust focus , aperature , shutter speed get exact picture you want . this camera manual focus , feature i sorely missed my older powershot a80 . thing bothers me most other cameras , you wade through bewilderingly large collection menu options make smallest changes . while i understand using layer or two menus things like basic settings ( time , format cf card ) i can't see it something basic film speed or white balance . which why i love this camera . following items one button away : flash flash output levelmulti-imagetime delay photoautofocus areamacro modemanual focuswhite balancezoom / outfilm speed ( 50 400)picture mode ( auto , manual , manual preset 1 2 , av , tv , portratit , landscape , backlit , panorama , movie)my favorite things this camera : battery life excellent . i bought spare battery , but i've never actually use one came it less than day . it charges fast too . picture quality : larger lens allows better pictures low light conditions , it very clear . large ccd allows you get pictures large enough resolution print out fairly large copies them look very good . ergonomic . this very comfortable camera hold long time . it not quite same range some much more expensive units , but i've never gotten tired holding it . plus , all buttons you need hit while running it right there under your fingertips . scroll wheel under your right index finger very intuitive operate . push it change modes , roll it change settings . fold out screen allows you take pictures odd angles without ever lay down your back picture . plus , fold out screen feels very solidly built , not like it'll snap off your hands . i always worried my powershot a80 , it didn't feel very solid . it works well my computer , which runs linux . i use gtkam , great camera programit infrared remote used take pictures without worrying camera shake . this very useful group pictures you'd like yourself . user savable white balance settings . real flash shoe . this camera takes standard canon flash unit . manual focus mode puts close up center screen right middle picture you check focus . this would really bothsome composing pictures , except when you half depress shutter button , small zoomed square center disappears leaves you whole picture . rapid fire photo option very useful action shots , some candid stuff , like subway pictures . mechanical view finder more than just adornment this camera . it quite good , it changes its field view according current zoom setting . it also focus adjustment it . this very nice if you wear glasses , it lets you adjust view finder your eye , you get your eye right up it , not keep bumping your glasses into back camera . very wide open fstop 2.0 very closed off 8.0 . lastly , it remembers virtually everything you setup last time it or certain mode , reverts those settings next time you turn it or switch modes . this includes things like white balance , settings not remembered my powershot a80 . now negatives : door covers usb port / dc input , av output very easy catch swivelling / revolving fold out screen , screen takes fare bit effort revolve , it quite likely you'll snapped door half before you notice it gone gotten itself caught spinning lcd screen that passing . if it gotten little bent , it get caught every time fold out screen until you snap it off or bend it back place . flash way too close lens , which makes some pretty obvious shadows bottom right hand corner some photos . luckily , i'm not much flash usage , if i , i'd probably spring real flash sat hot shoe . still , if you're looking great built flash , this not camera you . slow focus , autofocus become confused objects within few yards , never really focus . plus , focusing pretty slow . if you looking camera very fast , nearly perfect autofocus , you might better camera . movies limited 3 minutes maximum , which seems rather arbitrary . even 5 minutes would big step up , it would allow me catch average musical performance one step . final word : this great compromise camera someone who really wants two separate cameras but can't afford them . it good snap shot camera , good big lense , big body , big ccd machine capable creating art . it not best either those categories when compared other cameras , but one both , it represents perfect compromise pretty reasonable price	1
this works just described . long flash i-red beams see eachother it works fine ... but radio controlled flash much better	1
man . what lens !!! it not cheap , i dont ' find 135mm particularly useful focal length my 20d but after seeing glowing reviews this one both [ ... ] , i decided buy one try it myself . it not cheap $900 , but it worth every penny . this one absolute stunner . i cannot believe my eyes sharpness f2 it improves very little when stopped down . bokeh unbelievable !!! i dont ' hesitate shoot f2 i don't find it necessary stop down just increase sharpness . size build perfect although i don't like canon hood design . why can't they simply make hood same crincked finish lens ?? then they would not so easily scratch . it beyond me . but that not problem lens itself whenever i use this lens , i know i one best lenses ever designed . it forces me excel myself knowing now , only limitation me , photographer not camera or lens . absolute beauty . go try it yourself . i try shoot this much possible results stunning . i just wish it came weather proofing image stablization like canon modern lenses but that just nitpicking . i love it it	1
ability combine four different delay interval modes makes this product able accommodate almost any automatic-shooting situation . you control delay until sequence starts , delay shots , total shooting time , number shots . last one , however , where glaring flaw comes : controller limited 99 shots when you use total-number-of-shots setting . correspondence i've canon , they no explanation this asinine limitation . even modest cf card these days holds more than 99 shots , even raw mode . time lapse , 99 shots woefully inadequate . you work around this defect simply letting your card fill up or doing math using total-duration setting . but sometimes you want shoot multiple sequences one card . if you know you want 300 frames ( example ) , it annoying baby-sit camera stop it manually , or math figure out how many seconds total your sequence take , convert minutes seconds , then dial into setting controller . if you then decide use different interval , you get re-do all . dumb , canon . fact , this device shouldn't necessary anyway . every camera today should come this functionality ; it technically trivial , since every one these digital slrs computer plenty on-board timers logic this task	1
i just bought digital rebel month ago . love camera , my old 380ex speedlight integrates camera but just doesn't offer enough cycle speed keep up continuous mode rebel . this flash job rebel plug external battery pack promises even better performance once i grab item . big selling point really makes this unit worth cash , it its own infrared focus assist lamp which digital rebel lacks . when this flash mounted your digital rebel , you don't get annoying set quick flashes camera set off focus low light when using built-in flash . rebel body uses infrared focus assist 550ex focus lens ; this feature alone worth big bucks this baby costs . flash tons features most us might never use , but advanced amateur i'm glad they're there so i play if i should choose try out some fancy stuff . wireless slave capability handy but you've got least one more 420ex , 550ex or 580ex use . i like digital readout back flash also two way bounce head , it important note you press button make head turn either side side or up/down --- this should make head sturdier than i've seen some units get loose after awhile drive you nuts . this unit honker -- really big , , no lightweight either . get yourself big deep camera bag if you want lug this thing around you . what difference this 580ex ? 580 very slightly faster cycle times offers some fancy new automatic flash exposure bracketing modes , me anyway it wasn't worth almost two hundred dollars more 580 . all newer eos camera bodies fully supported this unit , it also works older eos bodies but there functions available newer ones aren't there older stuff . i like this flash it covers well , cycles fast controls fairly intuitive easy use . when you get yours don't lose book , canon doesn't seem them online anywhere i find i've seen places want charge you 18 bucks new one	1
if you would like list sites reviews email gumby dontquotemeonthat dot com pros : very sharp , bright ( fast ) , versatile , excellent build quality . cons : af tends dicy low-light conditions . pros : sharp , sharp , sharp . no distortion , no ca , optically superb better cons : ef-s mount . sell it when i upgraded 5d . pros : very solid build , internal focusing fantastic , produces wonderfully saturated photos high contrast , bokeh lovely very smooth , auto focus typical ring-usm full time manual focus excellent smooth . 2.8 aperture , 52mm filter size cons : i feel canon could reduce price , however this quality i don't mind paying it . if your newbie here some info lens " fast " when it low f-stop ... ok so when you smaller number apature bigger which allows more light through , so this means you up shutter speed . still enough light reach sensor . ok so lets say you out door shot if you say f/4 lens shutter speed could 1/250 second you would get good exposer . now this lens only go f/4 but if you same outdoor setting , f/ 2.8 lens you could jump 1/500 second get same exposer . freeze action mmore effectivly , this i believe why it " fast " lens . ok fun get it	1
i sold my nikon stuff canon , i using sigma 70-200 f/ 2.8 which very nice . when i moved canon i going get sigma lens again ( shooting soccer ) i wasn't any luck finding used one reasonably priced . i researched canon 200mm f/ 2.8 decided try it . i couldn't happier . af faster more accurate . it very easily hand held(i usually put sigma monopod ) i love this lens	1
this lens exactly what it should . overall quality extremely good . take look my photos : - first photo without lens- second photo lens flash- third photo lens without flashthere few things note photos : - there substantial amount barrel distortion . this normal . try not straight lines near borders photo make it less obvious . - fringing exaggerated . you notice fringing ( purple or blue tints ) high contrast edges objects near borders . you see this regular shots but more exaggerated wide angle lens . - lens makes shadow when using built-in flash . you see shadow photo flash . darker environment , it very obvious . external flash only way fix this . couple details : - you get extender nice brushed aluminum here : http://www.lensmateonline.com/s2.html- camera setting ( converter ) indicate you lens attached . it not obvious what it but it indicated change image stabilization icon so i assume it affects way image stabilization works . overall , i recommend this lens	1
job canon e-ttl ii nice feature but i wish they would provide battery indicator like canon dslr cameras	1
i bought this camera 6 mos . ago trip europe . it great , photos come out crisp clear , optical zoom great , there several manual features , although this not camera those who enjoy extensive custom settings . what i wanted , small poin-and-shoot digital camera , this fits bill . there some areas improvement canon continue work . while i am glad they left viewfinder this model lcd bit difficult see during really sunny days . whenever i connect usb cable camera , i am afraid i am going break off little cover usb port camera . finally , i know lithium ion battery enables case smaller , but i really wish i could grab battery off shelf supermarket	1
this camera potential pictures amazing clarity colors but not straight out camera . i too disappointed after converting raw files c1 pro acr . it possible my d-rebel would better than this monster gives me neck pains made my right arm start looking like swartzenegger arm ? even glass results dissapointing . problem not camera but workflow . after using it 2 months i am getting used workflow give me results i am looking . i realize this camera not perform any processing enhancements camera because pros need it themselves . once i got over fact i would sharpen saturate colors lot more than before i content never touched d-rebel ever since . ps beware severe neck pains when attaching any zoom lens . buy hand strap or better neck strap . some photo samples found here : http://www.trekearth.com/members/nbournas/photos	1
i purchased canon off camera shoe cord use canon ex 580 weddings . i needed cord use flash braket avoid red eye . it what it supposed . no complaints .	1
this flash preforms excellence ! all nikon products i pro grade . this flash recycles fast ready when i need extra light fill main light . i purchased sb-600 d-200 am very happy it . i used it last six weddings this year shooting action shots skate boarding compitions . . wolf , atl . ga	1
wicked 8.5 frames per second , this sports/action/photojournalists dream camera . if you need speed this one . aimed squarely sports shooters photojournalists , canon it . if you looking more portrait/art/wedding camera get canon 5d	1
digital photo frame easy use software excellent . i gave item 50th birthday gift set it up very large party . frame showed slide show 65 pictures became focal point guests . everyone spent time looking pictures family throughout 50 years . many asked where get frame . it hit it worked described	1
i don't know how i ever without this little item . its indispensable taking pictures tripod . it works easily efficiently exactly describe	1
monster little pricey , everyone knows , but it good stuff . this unit attractive , works well nicely designed . only one very small drawback : unless you small pointy fingers , first battery little hard remove . i use little plastic relay tool lever it out , which i store right charger . but i stayed 5 stars this one	1
i am technology guru this camera simple use great results . touch screen awesome !!! battery life so much better than other cameras i owned . i think this one outlast perform any them . buy it now if you want quality camera make you happy !!	1
filter decent . i paid only $3 free shipping so im not expecting much out this filter . i bought it protection it perfectly . not best night shots obviously but overall good buy	1
using either ef 16-35mm lenses or ef-s 10-22mm lenses ( 20d or rebel bodies 1.6 crop factor ) this hood helps eliminate ( i mean reduce lot ) flare sunny days or certain lightning conditions ..... highly recommended those who like shot lower end ( 16mm ) these lenses .	1
i am am very happy this package . only issue , thick stainless steel neck strap . i no use it i never seen anyone using it . i would prefer extra battery or existing battery extended life one . overall , price you cannot get leather case battery combo somewhere else same price amazon . i consider neck strap unnecessary component one comes camera lighter more flexible . it also more elegant .	1
careful when you use this lens because it not ( image stabilizer ) so if you shaky hands exposure any more than 1/8 second you going going get some blur . this why lens so cheap . this especially bad when you far end spectrum this lens . if you really zoomed it cloudy then you should know use tripod just case . this goes any lens , but if you using 300-mm end this then use tripod . it common sense , but i've loaned out this lens they complained me afterwards	1
i ordered this my parents , so they watch their first grandchild all day long :) i haven't spent lot time it because i won't keeping it , but i used it enough load bunch pictures it them found it very easy use , great picture	1
i bought this year ago taken many great pictures it . it light , many features used automatic when all you want point click . i can't recommend it enough .	1
this my first purchase digital camera . features pretty standard . pictures i am able take either very good or fuzzy . fuzziness applies some pictures auto focus unusable . some reason certain situations , i am unable get af work . i said before , when af works , i get very good quality pictures ... you want get bigger memory card too	1
case fits perfectly , canon product canon product should . took camera diving several times without hitch . i'd buy heartbeat	1
i think i originally gave hd1 i bought through amazon 5 star rating . while model performed satisfactorily me , some reviews i've read suggested it failed many instances . i think oled display must cause many failures , because sanyo apparently replaced oled display more conventional lcd display . i purchased hd1a , also amazon , because i like more than one camera angle , whether i'm videoing home consumption or stock video saved not-quite-ready-for-primetime mpeg 4 video codec ... although it really better than much my standard video shot mini dv tape cameras i oun . i found purchasing 49mm sanyo adapter , i could attach 2x lens i already ouned now optically zoom quite close subjects . i also purchased polarizing filter go larger lens really saturates color , especially clear blue sky . short , i think i feel more confident hd1a purchase than hd1 camera , although it still early days this could all change	1
this my 3rd digital camera i bought this one supplement my larger 10x zoom camera . this one fits nicely into pocket or small camera bag easily take it all events or travel . i've found it takes nice photos indoors when flash used .... even when cats or dogs i'm shooting moving around . i've felt life battery set pretty good , but i've using nice rechargeable ones . definitely get set 4 , then you 2 use 2 backup set . settings pretty easy figure out change 99% my photos taken " auto " setting came out pretty good . others indicated , indoors - without flash - produce blurry photos , but that nature almost all cameras , not unique this model . glad i bought it would highly recommend it	1
well worth investing ! always battery charging so you won't find yourself ready record something special find your battery low , even worse , dead ! not bulky , very portable , simple use ! all you need electrical outlet you're all set	1
i'm still new this camera , but i find it absolutely amazing . i fuji finepix 2003 i've just given up using one because it eats batteries doesn't take high quality pictures compared my friends ' cameras . i looking sales over thanksgiving break significant other took this hint . he found this camera very good deal department store , but it display model so i didn't get manual or anything like . however , camera itself really user-friendly , i've found i use most functions without look up what they . we just took trip atlantic city this camera performed well inside hotel , outside night , down ocean night , inside casino -- all types lighting , pretty much -- so long i chose proper options . i'm excited get know this camera better , but i think it excellent choice people looking something good quality reasonable price	1
this great camera so far . there lot options i haven't gotten chance use yet , but so far it easy takes great pictures	1
this film great color reproduction performance . i would give this film 5 stars except fact fujifilm superia x-tra 400 provides similar performance cheaper price	1
we bought this camera online , refurbished . everything functioned correctly . it not offer shutter speed adjustment , which only thing annoys me , because camera chooses slow(er ) shutter speeds , unless you point thing directly lightbulb . ( which , i might add , it took excellent picture ) so action shots not it specialty . however , macro shots , pretty much everything else works great .	1
this case great my camera my needs . i usually only take me my digital camera , four extra batteries , possibly one extra sd memory card . everything fits there great , i don't worry locating anything when i need it . i know just where it . i bought this case myself december , so far it washington dc new orleans ! i take suggestion someone else made strapping it around your waist , it worked like charm ... until heightened security museums washington , dc . i wiggle out it so it could go through x-ray machine ! but other than , it very comfortable , stayed put , i no complaints	1
truly amazing little camera . i looking something small i could stick my pocket when i go out everyday but still took sharp pictures . this camera all more . its small solid still manages take gorgeous photos very nice videos . i highly recommend this camera anyone looking easy use very portable camera	1
i really like this battery charger . it very easy operate charges batteries 1 hour . i leave them unit least anothr 1/2 hour make sure they fully charged . i like fact it comes 4 rechargeable batteries very affordable price	1
what horrible horrible horrible camera this . only thing nice it looks . like other lessons life , looks aren't everything . run away !!	1
i would love camera little thinner , it bit bulky but i like it very much . i still need get know it better , play it more .	1
i bought my sony dscm-m2 wolfs camera . iwanted something small could take really good pics ability record video . not want mini cassete . want one memory card . this thing grea t.t ake really good pics video . you transfer video m2 base station vcr record it even dvd recorder . i wish it little more zoom . inferred mode . just like sony night shot or super nightshot !!!! hopefully sony make dsc-m3 . add it camera . other wise this camera rocks !!!!!!! easy flip up lcd . wish it touchscreen . sony you made really great camera some one who wants small pocket size camera.my wife loves this camera . you switch photo video so easy . touch button	1
i just recently bought sony dsc-m1 camera absolutely love it . since then , i looking nice case store it . $10-20 you get full blown padded camera case all sorts pockets , zippers , straps what-not . thing , big point this camera , just how small portable it . stuffing generic camera case much triples size i t.t hats where this case comes . its probably one cheapest feeling ( looking ) cases i've seen . essentially it feels though its made cardboard ( very thing layer polyester wrapped around it ) , honestly , it feels like this case cost sony 2 cents make , no joke . so why heck i give this 4 stars ? well , it works great what its designed . its great fit , so adds almost no extra size already tiny camera ( huge plus ) , belt loop , well metal ring .. this nice it lets you connect it your pants very easily slide camera or out .. other cases you stumblings trying squeeze camera there . i would've liked some additional compartment it ( 2nd battery or additional memory stick)finally , this camera fully enclose camera . both upper left right sides camera fully exposed . so again , those additional problems , why heck am i giving it 4 stars ? simply , it works . its way too much money what you get , you're really only paying sony name packaging . but its best case out there m1 . if you spent $600 camera like myself , you spend $30 real good case it . if you want all-in-one case , all means get one generic branded ones , you'll get lot more functionality lot less . if you're looking ' perfect fit ' designed specifically this camera , one designed keep it same exact size , get this	1
this product , so far i know , not available amazon since jan . 8 comment claimed . it wasn't available feb . 19 when i ordered it amazon competitor . it now available ( march 1 ) very competitive price . it fabulous video camera . colors accurate , low-light performance amazing , video noise non-existent , resolution blow you away . 2-hr battery provides full 2 hours recording . camera light , flexible , intuitive use . sony minidv tapes cost reasonable $10 ea ., there zero dropouts . loading couldn't easier . it'd nice if sony would stick optical zoom specs ( 10x ) , since digital zoom anything ( why stop 20x ? - go broke , 1000x ! idiots . ) steadycam - optical stablization - seems work very well . you shut it off if you're using tripod . audio okay , but it could much better . they provide jack external mike powered shoe lamp . video output flexible - usb , ilink , component , s-video . speaking flexible , user guide runs over 100 pages ! there useful content every page - it'd take months try all options available ! image quality stunning , esp . considering reasonable price . i've not tried included software , but hdmi playback my panasonic 50 " plasma just like network hd ! fantastic ! you won't disappointed . ( okay , there one little glitch . zoom speed ( rate ) not menu adjustable . there variable zoom speed provided via little lever , but you'd better steady . ) great camera overall	1
i bought this camera directly sony store paid $650 march 7 , 2007 . amazon selling it $350 more than what i paid it . buy direct sony save . guy counter tried pressure me buy extended warranty , i declined . sale guys make more money selling equipment warranty then camera itself . camera works great , i also bought $20 stand which i use my sony digital stills camera . you can't go wrong this product . bira raibirara	1
i hope give more depth review later , but wanted sure make it clear everyone firewire cable ( so-called ilink ) not included this produc t.t he camera itself intuitive easy use out box but also highly customizable . video sound quality excellent , lcd screen gorgeous uses touch screen buttons addition button bar beneath it . but sony way making fantastic products then alienating purchasers those products ( la ps3 ) . so understand order very basic essential task transferring your dv images your computer requires you shell out $35-70 more buy firewire cable . provided usb cable transferring stills memory stick only . thus , this camera only receive 4 stars due sony cheap skate approach . caveat emptor ..	1
there some very detailed reviews , most which i read before i ordered camera amazon . there ample evidence professionals find camera useful . i want take minute speak rest us . camera came month ago i've extremely happy it . let me offer some perspective my comments . last camera i bought small sony shirt-pocket-sized camera i using alot it got me back into taking pictures . i decided since i taking so many pictures i wanted camera would take much better quality shots , without my get phd picture-taking . i opted this camera 18-200mm lens . i now take same pictures i took small camera , but zoom lens i frame them better 10.2 mega pixels i blow them up frame them . there dozens ( hundreds ? ) features i grow into , but now i am delighted use this camera right out box , just minimal reading instructions . everything i remember my 35mm days ( my first camera minolta srt-101 i bought 1973 ) put use , but what i forget , camera remembers . my poin t--t his camera ready meet you wherever you grow you should you decide you want go farther out deeper	1

it certainly isn't hollywood quality , i wouldn't use it music . but interviews , sound works just fine , especially considering price . my only real complaint clip lavalier . unless you slip it into lapel hole , it generally fall off if your subject moves more than tiny bit . bottom line : i'd buy it again kind shooting i	1

i bought my parents each their own digital picture frame christmas . they not technical geeks any stretch imagination . they love it ! frame easy set up easy use sd card . only cons this product ... resolution isn't my standard ( but more than ample people who aren't self proclaimed photography-snobs ) . i also wish it option greater than 12 seconds pictures . 30 seconds would nice so it doesn't make you feel like you're watching powerpoint presentation all day . i would strongly recommend this product . price , you can't beat it	1
you get 200 pictures under $60.00 . or you could buy 40 pack around $28.00 . 200 bulk , better price money . can't go wrong	1
i wouldn't paid full price this but little more than cost spare battery it good buy . i two regular 8800 batteries but when traveling away charger i wanted something i could fall back aa batteries available anywhere . reason i don't know how long nikon continue carry battery designed camera . i already jvc camcorder it impossible buy battery , leaving me tied power cord it came , well few other appliances propriatary " rechargeable " batteries expired can't replaced . i attached battery pack my camera test it out using mix nimh batteries surprised how long it lasted . somebody already mentioned , battery pack camera not fit coolpix carrying case , it fit well my lowepro case i used carry around my 35mm slr cameras . batteries also add quite bit weight so you need consider if you doing lot hiking .	1
this battery got me though many shoots my many dv films . it last long it specifies . too bad i sell it i am buy new canon my pana died . it great battery though , great price	1
this cable unique usb cable nikon digital camera . only problem i couldn't find darn thing anywhere . it functional piece equipment certain but nothing super special .	1

i bought this camcorder $300 which good price because this camera gave me tons features clear picture . great shooting family videos or amature movies like i make myself . it very small too . over all im very happy this camcorder . yes i edited my review earlier there humming noise , but it turned out my fan . i love this camcorder !	1
great handycam . fast easy use . we received it 5pm used it 7pm record concert .	1
this great little pocketable camera . i love it . get most out it , it important experiment various settings . some tips : - outdoors , set exposure middle setting , white balance sunny ( or prevailing weather , auto works well too . ) , i turn off image stabilization because it causes weird distortion warping-like effect especially if you move , make sure night shot off . i also use vga setting 640x480 tv resolution . these settings , my videos look great even my 42 inch plasma tv . but don't expect high-end results , but very good results , better than i expected price size . way , digital zoom only ok up 1.5 , after which it gets much too blurry . also , make sure set lens focus either long shot or close up , it makes big difference sharpness . you switch it even while shooting . - indoors , you use nightshot help somewhat dark room , but make sure take exposure down least one notch left middle setting . night shot helps making picture lighter , but it also causes lot blurring when things move . lowering exposure helps compensate lessen blurring . i found middle exposure setting causes too much blurring unacceptable . just turn it down notch two middle , you'll get acceptable good results . course adding more light room helps . don't use image stabilization , it distorts image too much . - photos , use same settings you'll get good results . some photos i took outside beautiful day came out stunning , look fantastic plasma tv . overall , i couldn't more pleased it . i also got 2gb sd card extra battery , which i recommend . it perfect size weight just keep your pocket catch those spur moment shots , price it can't beat	1
i agree most reviews here . it heavy not particularly quick focusing , but makes great pictures . i moved up 70-300 nikkor , it well worth it . extra 100mm wonderful ( essentially it like 600mm lens 35mm ) . vr fantastic . one best endorsements it number times i've heard " you took handheld ? " . closer minimum focusing distance would nice , but i no real complaints this lens . i posted couple photos here , but you can't really see detail . some nikon lenses feel like they're made masses . 80-400 ' pro ' feel you come expect nikon . you won't disappointed	1
perfect video camcorder outside recording . crisp picture excellent sound . wide screen mode looks great . extra battery must long vacations or shoots . not forget shoulder strap because you not want drop this baby . also excellent still photos memory stick option . easy button just easy . indoor shooting little rough without proper lighting so careful . overall , great piece electronic	1
this my first digital camera , i lot search finaly i decide dsc-w55 black , what i looking , small enough it my purse , lot functions , very easy import pictures my computer , you only connect camera usb cable you don't need install software came camera , i windows vista i didn't any problems transfering pictures , best camera price great , you choose super saver shipping save more . you love this camera too , small , very pretty , lots options , take great pictures . some one wrote review this camera feels like plastic , that not true , looks very durable me i think good product worth every single dollar you spend . easy shoot pictures auto adjustment mode , start taking pictures sooner you charge battery , because this camera internal memory you buy memory card later . well hope you lots fun taking pictures , good luck ..!	1
just took it vacation , pictures awesome . easy carry , easy use . no complaints	1
muy buen producto , buena calidad , facil de llevar protege muy bien la camara	1

i won't go no brand name battery again . frankly , i don't think any battery holds charge long it should . however , this one ok but it not generic either . spend money get real thing . otherwise you'll spend same amount quantity other just get same amount time	1
i ordered 3 en-el2 batteries . they arrived before estimated delivery time great condition . i am very happy price service this company	1
i bought this scope amazing bargain just $30 christmas tree shop . i read lot it sure it great buy . soon i brought it home i took it out box gasped awe . it high quality peice looked great . this model equatorial mount so you synchronize it celestial pole(poloaris ) it gives you ability track objects across sky . it large solid tripod adjusted easily . two lenses it comes magnify objects either 45 or 125 times . when i first took telescope out my dad we found moon i amazed what i could see lunar surface just 45 times magnifacation ! moon took up nearly entire field vision lowest magnifacation detail amazing ! using other lens even better i could see craters maria all sorts amazing things . just few days ago i used my night sky magazine(which great magazine way ) able find saturn it high sky right beehive cluster close gemini right now . after few minutes searching through low power eyepiece i found it . bright blob golden light eypiece . hands trembling i carfully adjusted focusing nobs i saw it . saturn all its glory my eypeice . i could just make out rings though it small it clear sharp . i hurredly popped lens out put more powerful one i saw saturn even more detail . i could see cassini division ! fortunetly atmosphere coraperating so i could see somthing most would need large reflector see . i amazing i could see it so small telescope . my night sky magazine it says march/april issue you see nebulae , galaxies , clusters amazing things just low magnifacations such 30 or 50 times . i even see m41(the beehive cluster ) just binoculars ! i saw cluster when i looking saturn . so if you see this telescpope even 50 or 100 dollars buy it you wont disapointed	1
i used pretty good slr bw film . i thought i decent photographer could lot camera . when digital came out all automatic settings ' no thinking required ' settings , i lost enthusiasm sport . p712 brought my interest photography back life . all good things everyone else saying this camera , it ability give photographer complete control over every critical factor making photograph . not just aperture shutter speed , but white balance , ' film speed ' , quality level , color , bw or sepia , multitude other user controllable features . this camera loads fun me i enjoy messing around all settings . if you person who doesn't enjoy all playing around i just described , you assured this camera deliver best pictures possible it automatic mode . it best point shoot camera i've ever . but it so much more . i like feel p712 much better than z612 . 612 plastic/flimsy feel it , my opinion . it seems bit larger more substantial than 612 although i expect picture quality same . i am very pleased my 712	1
these binoculars amazing they completely crystal clear perfect size you going hiking or walking . i would completely recommend this product	1
i purchased s70 10 months ago travelled it throughout southeast asia through harsh climate conditions rough roads . camera flawless ! camera " build " fabulous camera quite simple operate even though it many features found digital slrs . two features i like most : 1 ) panaorama feature combination zoom browser software produce breathtaking super wide angle panoramic images 2 ) capability shooting/storing images raw format those special occassions when you know you going want print image highest quality ( its successor s80 nothave raw image feature ) . this very high quality camera if you don't want bulk digital slrs market but want very high quality images ---- this camera !! this camera turned me into canon fan ! i recommend least 1 gig memory card one extra battery . highest resolution i getting least 350 images 1 gig card . i also recommend lowepro case compatible s70 like rezo series pouches very protective holds extra batteries memory cards	1
i spent lot time researching cameras before i chose this one . overall i'm quite pleased , but i'm not through mastering this camera just yet . there only one big negative me lack image stabilization . this not best camera action shots - i get lots blurred shots when i try photograph my kids or dogs while they moving - which most time . other than , i love low light features - you get decent picture nearly totally dark room or outside under moon . i love natural setting where you take 2 pics one click , one using flash other without compare 2 . i love fact my batteries last forever !!!! i love video capabilities this camera . i may never use my vhs-c camera again ! macro awesome well , i like photograph flowers . money i think this very good camera . i don't use face detection feature much , don't really see need it , but i suppose it kind cool feature those who want it . i'd trade it more image stabilization though . i would reccomend this camera anyone who wants more than just point shoot camera but isn't ready slr or doesn't money spend slr .	1

i bought this present my wife . i looking something she could carry her purse . automatic functions easy functional . it not enthusiasts camera : too hard get into menus . screen easy turn off(this sucks battery power ) . it even optical viewfinder(a rare finding lately ) optical viewfinder helps get steady pictures those us shakes . pictures clear colors excellent . drawback sony batteries cost arm leg . wire downloading pix multifunctional very proprietary(read expensive if you lose it	1

great build quality comes solid case . job its supposed good optics	1
i liked it it working fine . consno usb cable night times not right time shoot video or photo both .	1
dsc-t100 great all round point shoot all features expected camera this class . 5x optical zoom nice given non protruding lens , allows very quick start up time around second . additionally face detection very good , once it locks subject/s it visually moves them keep focus area frame always right place . it used full auto settings or it gives access manual controls , however i found auto very good almost all situations . pictures taken very good quality although low light high iso blur little . continuous shoot mode allows almost 3 shots second out flash which leaps ahead casio i traded this . menu structure sony very intuitive feels like proper interface rather bunch options long list . all all very good , easy use , high featured compact camera . i would recommend anyone .	1
i am new digital cameras , but shooting film variety formats systems over 30 years . after much research agonizing compromises , i waited purchased this pentax optio 33wr . it small , but fits my small hands well . all controls nicely defined laid out . i began using camera prior consulting manual because camera logically engineered . manual well thorough , pentax also spells out accompanying acdsee software - not needed if you own mac . you also download manual specs this many pentax cameras directly pentax doc site - free , prior purchase if you want study this . specs available quite accurate . output great ! sharp lens , fast focus , accurate exposure , it fits my pants pocket . it lot flexibility ps fair number manual features if you need them . nicely sealed , all weather unit . solid feel ! lots positives ! negatives : came 2 inexpensive alkaline batteries instead lithium versions - i replaced them , but one find power this camera anywhere . camera comes 16mb sd memory card which good 8-10 hi-res pix , so i replaced it 64mb version ($34 ) . all-in-all , 4 stars may conservative because i like it it nearly all i need want	1
great product price . it tough hold 10x binocular steady , but when you hold down stabilize button it locks . you also pan while locked down track something moving such wild game or airplanes , etc . low light viewing not so good , but i'm not willing pay premium get , nor carry extra weight would go larger lenses .	1
i bought this camera back-up my d2x so i wouldn't change lenses much trip i'm taking alaska this summer . well let me tell you , d200 18-200mm vr lens incredible . it fast , quiet pleasure use . i've read forums 18-200 little soft . so far i totally disagree , pictures i've taken very sharp . i wish this would available when i bought my d2x . if it , i would own two d200 instead one each . highly recommended !!	1
no lens doesn't everything . but after six months my camera its go lens 90% my shots . lowlight , macro extensive tele work need something more , but everything else you just keep it . real benefit this lens its sharp contrasty 18mm up through 170mm . its main problems vignetting wide apertures distortion . most photos its not noticeable , but when it problem photoshop ptlens or dxo get you results look like pro lens because you've got inherent sharpness contrast work . its great flexibility , convenience , dust protection ( not change lenses all time ) its worth its price	1
this my second digital camera . i owned pentax optio , which very small , so i hesitant purchase this camera due its somewhat larger size . however , poster before me mentioned , this camera not only small ( not tiny though ) light weight , but it also takes really incredible pictures . under $150 this camera offers alot more than other cameras same price range better quality pics . one thing i would like mention , aside taking great standard night day pics , ability adjust picture ratio . second night out using this camera , i able fit all 6 my friends one shot , sitting comfortably sofa club ( 16:9 ratio setting ) . really blew me away . after careful research consideration , i am very pleased my purchase	1

i'm using this flash sto-fen omni-bounce diffuser it it takes flawless photos . wish it just bit more power , but still works well out 20 feet or so even diffuser while bouncing off cieling , so i can't complain	1
yes , it great buy , only depending who you . this camera perfect someone who doesn't want anything , just take picture . it many settings many different situations : indoor parties hikes cluody skies . only bad thing i found weight . it very compact , but you feel you it your pocket ( leica lenses inside quite heavy ) . happens because you amazing 10x zoom . picture quality beautiful . colors pictures almost better than real ( kinda scary ... ) . very fast processor , good battery life . screen very big . great buy	1
purchased this tuesday store since i needed it before it could delivered . i completely agree previous reviewer ease use this camcorder . battery charged less than hour i ready go , except i failed notice they not include dvd-r disc . :( so , i wait but not disappointed . i able format disc while using battery , not a/c adapter like previous user , it took all 5 seconds . i can't wait use camcorder my daughter soccer tournament starting saturday . go mustang fury 96 !!	1

this kit , although not died wool professional , excellent starting point serious amateurs learn how use studio lighting effectively without spending fortune . i basic ingredients experiment produce excellent results .	1
you can't find better lens price . some people seem let down speed focusing capability this lens 200mm or above but it should expected if shooting telephoto , user would incorporate tripod . i originally thought buying tamron 18-250mm but this lens half price although you lose 10mm width , you gain 50mm length . few people who reviewed this lens put it canon 30d or similar pro digital slr , question i , why would you spend $3000 body $250 lens ???? it makes no sense ! i this lens mounted my digital rebel xti it great match . i would love faster zoom lens this range but i don't want spend thousands dollars needed . if you like me enjoy photography , hobby not make living , you should buy this lens it superior versatility . if you professional photographer need superior quality , you shouldn't even looking this lens , so please us casual photographers favor , don't review this lens	1
i bought these upcoming alaskan cruise boy i glad i . we some other 10x25 binocs i used years wanted upgrade something more substantial . these amazing ! they so clear stabilization most impressing aspect them . i used them least once day since buying them bird watching , astronomy ( moon looks amazing ) watching new housing development go 3 miles away . my parents considering getting pair cruise too , i plan share but i don't think i'll want without these long . wonderful product i plan use years come	1
i took my camera hawaii intention bringing it swimming , kayaking , snorkeling it worked like charm . clear , sharp pictures without leaking one bit water . i used it salt water it submerged least 15 minutes time swimming pacific . you grease lubriate rubber sealing ring follow directions carefully order it leakfree . it comes tube grease rubber seal , anti-fog solution you rub onto lens . you make sure seal good condition ( not twisted , completely dust free ) . you also soak case sink 30 minutes after exposure salt water . i guess you should buy new seals periodically if you detect any moisture inside . i like strap it comes buoy keep camera sinking if it falls into water . iit every control duplicated perfectly you operate camera just well if it wasn't case . zoom , menu , cursor , camera modes , power , image stabilization off , external buttons all accessible . i took movies well pictures . i think this better solution than buying camera waterproof ( e.g pentax w20 ) . you ultra small camera out case but tough dunkable camera when you need it . sony makes it very clear it not responsible if water leak , but so far , thing works well .	1
this not true black white film , it color film no color ... but results still quite nice if you ask photo lab print it true black white paper . you your prints back back next day or even 1 hour , depending lab . this much nicer than hassle true black white sent away while you wait week	1
i bought this lens my 35mm pentax camera , since i'll buying one dslr bodies sometime . it fantastic : very very sharp great saturated color . par , sharpness-wise my zuiko ( 50mm 1.4 1.8 , 85mm f/2 ) nikon primes , but better color ! contrast good well , there rumors lens underexposes bit - perhaps it , but works well film . film camera , there vignetting when you zoom wider than 21mm - but that nice special effect , sort semi-fisheye 16mm . also , using supplied lens shade isn't great idea when shooting 35mm film cameras , vignetting starts early . there no aperture ring , so if buying this film body , make sure it compatible fa-j style lenses . my pz50 body , i can't set aperture , but it works fine program shutter priority mode . overall , this super lens , best i've owned	1
i recently started small photography business doing black white shots kids their natural environment . i wanted camera took quality shots , but still cost effective . i most definitely found it . my cannon takes great shots allows me mobility needed chase kids around . very pleased .	1

grown up using pentax slr cameras lenses i very intrigued k100d ability reuse some my mount lenses . i am extremely impressed so far image quality , built-in flash ( no red eye problems so far ) almost instantaneous shutter camera . oppressed so long compact digital cameras i reinvigorated my love photography can't wait explore many features k100d . auto-focus very good so far just one occasion where it didn't seem adjust properly , but also could operator error	1
i bought this camera more than half year ago . my intention get decent camera images , but then also able use it filming short movies . i'm very pleased its performance . good lighting conditions , colors come out amazing . i really really not expect them so vivid sparkling ! darker conditions , well , it still works fine , not nearly bad i expected some other reviews . photos might grainy or not vivid anymore , but stuff still perfectly suitable show photos people . filming , it terrific . i mean , resolution great ( sth like 848 640 or so ) , better than what one could possibly expect regular camera . quality super awesome , looks very neat computer screen . respect . it pointed out you cannot zoom while filming , but not many cameras out there . oh , it also very small gigantic screen great battery life . great buy	1
i find this great little camera money . my needs , it just right . i find it takes clear pics , very small , so easy carry . i no problems it all . i carry it case my belt or pocket . i recommend it highly	1
this camera great our use -- i wanted high megapixel camera so i could blow up pictures frame them , that exactly what i got . i love option able turn viewfinder so it doesn't get scratched , but sometimes digital options bit difficult figure out ( i.e. changing mode , changing flash ) . once you get it , it easy get back , though ! we recommend this if you want heavy duty camera - it isn't tiny , but it fits my purse best all doesn't break first drop ! :-)	1
i got this camera replace 3.2 mp nikon coolpix ... it instantly gave me wow effect . camera so thin , it fits comfortably your pocket go anywhere . screen beyond huge ( my nikon only 1.3 inch screen , so this major upgrade ) . only disappointment would actual " resolution " image . i mean ... picture files themselves don't seem able zoomed computer much i expecting without becoming pixilated . but i guess maybe that how it supposed , 6 mp doesn't mean you zoom crop eternity ? either case , i soon got over ... because pictures always turn out great . colors accurate , pictures very clear , even variety situations , best shot modes actually useful , unlike my nikon which they didn't help very much . also i must say this camera very fast taking pictures , starting up , recovering flash going off . which great . it so annoying when you stand wait " black screen " while flash reloads or something . finally , i say included rechargeable battery awesome ! it lasts ... almost eternity . you take hundreds pictures one charge ... so great ! previously , i would always need spare aa batteries , but not anymore ! this camera fulfill needs any normal person who isn't expecting slr-camera . i would recommend it anyone . before purchasing this camera , i put lot research into it competitors . i say : buy this one . it great	1
this nice accessory kit considerably less expensive than buying all components separately . if you want olympus-branded battery you can't go wrong here because they throw neck strap case still it cheaper than buying batter alone	1
pro : this camera big screen , long-life battery , light weight , which easy carry around . con : size little big man hold one hand , let alone women	1
good product , like price . this much less expensive than current pinseeker 1500 models , i bought it ebay used $150 so you may able find it less ( look under hunting golf rangefinders this model ) . this not pinseeker feature newer models but normal mode scan mode work perfectly ranging flags no reflectors ( although you may need try more than one time relatively stable hands ) . i able range flag 270 yards , able range top telephone pole 375 yards ( but it windy so flag straight out little cloudy ) . i would estimate this work ranging flags calm sunny day ( these don't work well sunny day because laser used visible light laser gets little interference sunlight ) 215-230 yards flag ( which what i need it ) . less expensive alternative than pinseeker , i really like performance , very impressed .	1
i thought twice before buying this lens . it wasn't designed specifically my canon a620 , it required purchase adapter ring , it blocks flash . said , lens feels good camera ( even canon plastic adapter ) pictures what i hoping . i use it all time . it great assembling panoramics , doesn't suffer any unexpected distortions ( beyond horizontal bending you get any wide angle lens ) . highly recommended	1
i really like this camera ! it fairly simple use , takes great pictures packed features . it fits nicely hand compact enough slip coat pocket or purse . we bought this camera our daughter birthday . she using it ease especially loves movie sound option . my opinion , camera winner any adult or kid wanting good all around digital camera . my only negative it battery hog . most digital cameras , you want make sure you get rechargeable batteries large memory card	1

upgrading old sony trv-130 hi-8 digital camcorder . what difference every aspect . size options exposure there no comparison . what almost looked dull pale reddish , bordering black white full high grain my old 130 now comes out crisp , colorful no real visible grain hc90 . unfortunately any camera this camera perform best adequate light . my problem my trv-130 i mostly shooting indoors pro lighting setups whim unrealistic me so i make 100 watt bulbs they trick this camera . awesome color , crisp detail i really love true widescreen progressive modes . they give my videos unique film like look them . other than you love this cameras low light capability which clincher me getting this unit . all features combined make it must buy	1
this great video camera . my only complaint uncomfortable awkward hand positioning when " taping " or even while taking still pictures . i end up use two hands ( luckily i extra one ) steady camera , especially while using wide angle / telephoto feature . it even difficult press " record " button stop recording without fair amount movement .	1
these great bird watching . they make things very clear distance . good buy	1
