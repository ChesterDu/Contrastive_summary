i am not disappointed . this grill cooks hot . 500 degrees within 10 minutes . fact . i've grill month i think i've grilled 25 days month . i need watch it all meat but man i'm loving it . it so convenient . my last grill didn't cook hot . it didn't leave grill marks . it didn't flavor what this grill offers . there not much complain . i dropped it while trying put it together myself . i thought it going break my floor , not other way around . this sucker tough!i'm glad i didn't go cheap . i can't afford $1000-$2000 grill so this good medium me . my last grill i paid $250 . it rusted 2 years replacement parts cost almost much grill so i dumped it . i think i'll get my money worth out this weber . this price even shipping it cheaper order online through amazon than buy local . i consider this one smarter purchases i've made amazon . ** bad side . nothing grill but amazon shipped it through company named egl or eagle ? logistics company they sure don't know what their doing . delivery date kept changing eventually it week later than original estimated date . they sent it reno sacramento chicago omaha back chicago then back omaha . omaha they hired two dudes truck drive it des moines where i live . once des moines they called me while i work . i met them gas station highway lead them my house . it took 20 minutes find them because one spoke english still new language . no problem . they nice enough fellas but i'm just not used going get my stuff when i order amazon . i've ordered least 50 items off amazon . normally i track it thru internet it shows up my door . this case i call freight company get status . then directing drivers around business . i guess this special order maybe that why they sell it this price .	1

great weber accessory ! sturdy easily removed storage cleaning	1
seems quality product , but others already mentioned , instruction booklet seriously lacking . one thing , there no index , nor table contents . i spent hour trying figure out how engage alarms outdoor high temp , etc ., no avail . i guess i am just not hitting right buttons , or leaving them depressed long enough . i able calibrate barometer match my wall-mounted barometer i admit - it works very well . i enjoy too barometric histogram , covering last 36 hours . because booklet doesn't explain , i am still trying figure out what percentage factor " forecast index " really means , why it sometimes presented " 12 hour forecast " , other times it 24 hour forecast . because outdoor sensor not waterproof , it becomes bit challenge locating device where it protected rain , direct sun exposure , etc ., yet out open true reading , so not influenced warmth radiating house . la crosse ought strive waterproof sensor someday	-1
