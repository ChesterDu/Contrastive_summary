okay , yes , i know brand dr. kracker maybe should clue texture this product . however , i flatbreads made other companies actually texture pita . these very crunchy don't whole lot flavor . additionally , they shipped arrived expired . if you shopping super-healthy cracker , this may it . if you looking whole grain flatbread texture pita , keep shopping - this not it . my next venture this product grind it up use bread crumbs top broiled tilapia	-1

flavored peanut butter short-lived quirky product line 30+ years ago . it bad idea buoyed few years cute name , catchy jingle , generation sugar-addicted children , adolescents " munchies . " now , pb max trying this idea again . far i tell , there no good use , nor nutritional value , this product . it phony , overly-sweet flavor doesn't taste like snickers or peanut butter not good any kind bread unless you really weird cravings . come , would you take real snickers bar make sandwich out it peanut butter ? if so , you might find this product convenient if inferior-tasting alternative . this doesn't melt evenly so trying use it sauce prove frustrating . it gets oily separates doesn't work well dipping . yes , you could spread it apple slices or eat it straight up if you so inclined . i'll go real snickers bar or plain apple slices , thank you very much . you could also get this your kids eat , but please try better parents than ! note you buying 6 jars this once , so even if you find niche use it , you'll quite bit it use up . i'm betting you'll get tired it long before it gone	-1

while i like all kashi products i've tried , this one my favorite ! little fresh fruit , how much more healthy you get ? great taste seven grains sesame ! perhaps other reviewer threw away cereal ate box	1
we initially discovered this cereal one big warehouse stores , but they not consistently stock it . we enjoy flavor , fact it made organically-grown grain , health benefits flax seed high fiber . time purchase , we found amazon price over dollar cheaper per box than our local grocery store . we bought two cases !	1
i like nutiva hemp protein . great protein source easier digest than whey also provides half daily required amount fiber . can't beat ! it won't leave you feeling heavy bloated like whey sometimes . i like taste texture too . mixes great cranberry juice/cranberries , stevia , ice water ! i add some berry green extra energy nutrients ! it my morning breakfast .	1
my doctor ordered me eat heart-healthy food , saying raisin bran one best bulk count . he said it good idea not only eat it breakfast , but also eat small bowl before dinner , especially those over age fifty who might tend towards constipation . it sure beats " prunes " my mother day ! i always liked raisin bran , this packet 70 individual boxes last me little over month ... if i follow my doctor advice . i also enjoy convenience amazon new store staple groceries . only drawback i see finding extra storage space if i order everything last month .	1
these really great . they very sour when eaten alone , but amazingly good cereal or oatmeal . great fruit hand , especially when they out season	1
my kids love these lollipops ! so my husband ! flavors great they perfect size - not too big not too small . they taste better than other artificial ones you find grocery stores	1

i little hesitent make big order so much tea , not knowing if i would like it . so i went local supermarket bought tin there so i might give it taste test . this quite good green tea . other than buying generic green teabags , i usually buy bancha tea . this tea not grassy , more bold slight smokey taste more kickiness i t.t he cannisters nice their inside foil liner keep tea fresh . only thing aware this lot tea , altogether 21 ounces divided into six separate cannisters . unless you really love this tea , plan making some gifts	1

i tried most jack links ' products . i classified this one good ... but i personally prefer beef nuggets since it tasted juicier .	1
i use plenty this product regularly when making ice cream , cookies , cakes etc ... i find this product sort natural sweetness or flavor its own . because this much less added sugar needed baked goodies some cases added sugar eliminated . obtain this , i use this organic unsweetened coconut combination organic whole milk .	1
these definite time saver couple faults which reviewer pointed out -- no flavorings rice , nori cut too small . get around rice problem , just add little rice vinegar sugar rice it comes out quite good . i don't particularly like wasabi but they should probably add packet box those who . nori sheets taste good fresh if maybe slightly salty my tastes . stated before though , they definitely cut way too small . you cannot achieve any kind decent looking roll them , but if you aren't picky what finished product looks like if you pack any added ingredients pretty thin , you get it hold together long enough eat it . bottom line ten bucks i paid 6 packages , i'd say it definite winner 6 cheap fast lunches taste much better than they look . i can't eat one sushi roll local sushi bar less than 8 10 bucks . now price these gone up little , i'd probably consider just buying larger size annie chun precooked sticky rice containers ( if amazon gets them back stock ) providing my own full size nori sheets .	1
i never big cereals until i tried this one . now i'm hooked . thisis very flavorable cereal nice mix strawberries blueberries . it great anytime you " munchies " but don't want eat empty calories . it also best all cereals thatadd fruit	1
earl grey my favorite blend tea far - no competition there . biggest secret this tea once given earl grey hoswick hall ( british prime minister 1830 - 1834 ) chinese manadarin , reportedly gratitude after earl saved his life , get just right doseage bergamot oil , rather intense , tangy scent derived bergamot orange ( which turn cross pear lemon sour orange ; latter native south vietnam , its oil probably recipe original ingredient ) . using too much bergamot oil easily obscure black tea natural flavor - but twinings you just can't go wrong , because original earl grey turned this very company match quickly dwindling supply he received his chinese friend . ( twinings website : " when mandarin tasty gift began run out , earl grey asked his tea merchants , twinings , match it him . twinings unique blend grey family long-standing favourite . when guests inquired it , they directed twinings strand , where they would ask earl grey tea name . " ) unless you insist * all * your tea cream or milk , i recommend this one without any kind milk products : not only original recipe not call such addition ; my mind it just plain ruins blend particular flavor . ( but that just me , course . ) whichever way you it , though , if scented teas your kind thing , twinings earl grey should right up your alley	1

warning : boring review follows ! ha ha : i interested buying these individual servings cereal my family wondered if cups , bowls or little boxes cheapest per ounce . cups hold more than bowls boxes(usually twice much based cereal type ) . i mean we would eaten 2 bowls if it really cheaper way . i went kelloggs site compare how much cereal cups versus how much individual bowls or little boxes . bowls , cups boxes all seem end up costing fractions pennies one ounce per ounce . i didn't add up all kinds per variey pack see which grand total costed pennies more or less based ounce ( i am not frugal ) , but picked corn pops frosted flakes compare . prices all kinds very comparable , so if your wondering which type buy , it doesn't really add up much difference . i check these things because sometimes big " value " sizes actually more expensive per ounce/gram than little sizes . those marketing people tricky ! therefore , if you want more little bowls or you pick cups ( more each ) , you make your choice know you won't spending way more either way . i skipped choosing boxes because i liked convenience bowls , but honestly carboard boxes probably better planet ( but anyway , i save some energy , water , soap not washing bowls ! ) now all they need sell cute little dispenser my counter i never go back boxes	1
i love jerky tried it all including making my own . this first product i consider good or better than mine ! price great	1
principle , this great product : it actual fruit , nothing added , dried crisp put packet only 85 calories . if you're looking light , healthy-ish snack foods still tasty , this great choice . but there couple problems : 1 . packets very narrow long , which makes it virtually impossible reach into them get fruit out , once you're past top third or so . 2 . there decent amount fruit dust inside -- which , these berries cherries , red , just waiting bit added water stain up any fabric it lands . either these isolation no problem , but put them together , you've got product you must pour out , yet product you can't pour out . i guess maybe if you bowl or something , it wouldn't big deal , but sort takes away portable-snack nature it , no ? much i liked fruit , inconvenience packaging going keep me buying more . oh , one more caveat : despite " cherry berry " name , this least 50% apple . i suspect apples dried fruit mixes what peanuts mixed nuts , inexpensive unobjectionable filler . apple tastes fine all , but i wouldn't mind more cherries berries , fewer apples	1
