this water jet button handle just like waterpic . you push it temporarily stop flow water . here warning : it take lot finger pressure stop flow water especially if you adjusted dial hard flow . if you lack ordinary strength your fingers stay away this machine . i don't finger strength problem yet several times i've squirted water all over bathroom because somehow i hadn't pushed hard enough stop button . i purchased waterpik , but trouble it leaking , so purchased this conair . waterpik much better quality product . conair seems very cheaply made , i am not very happy it . i am going back using my waterpik even though it occasionally springs leak .	-1
i received this tweezer christmas , so i'm glad i didn't spend anything it because it not even worth 50 cents . tweezer portion not grip any hairs . it piece crap far i'm concerned . not bother purchasing this product , if you , you'll regret it	-1
this not my first facial sauna but it worst i've used . " cold " function not work well ( not significantly enough least ) but hot function works fine . it tends leak water you put , even if you keep it below max-fill line .	1
i boughten this gift which turned out aweful idea . it way too loud force air way too strong . it literally causes loss hearing causes your hair look like you just caught tornado . i not recommend this hair dryer anyone .	-1
i really like size this pitcher but there one thing i'm not too happy . filter doesn't " lock " down into top when you tip pitcher over pour water out , filter plops out top , causing whole top fall out pitcher . it very aggravating just makes it more trouble than it worth . other brita pitcher i , filter locks into place doesn't this .	1
it doesn't what it supposed . this gizmo supposed clean out pores generally clean up skin your face . didn't work me	-1
i followed instructions didn't overuse it . motor went after 2 months . i miss it so much i am considering getting one , even though i never got my money back first one	1
these ' cartridges ' sell $2 piece , plus shipping . i recently switched mach 3 turbo merkur double edge safety razor i safely say i never go back . mach 3 provides decent enough shave ( much better than electric , my experience ) but single blade actually much smoother . i pay 50 cents blade now safety razor - each blade lasts little over week - versus mach 3 $1.50 - $2.00 lasting 6 or 7 days	1
i don't particularly large skull but these barely fit together bridge my nose . i don't see how manufacturer claim one size fits all ; i said i don't huge melon like mike myers brother " so i married axe murderer " . idea/concept great but ... i'll probably return them . unfortunate because i really looking forward using them . people really big heads , caveat emptor	-1
i've used much better electric shavers past . i find it hard hard get close shave but easy scrape my skin .	-1

our first unit lasted almost 2 months . despite relatively short lifespan , i thought product worth it considering dirt-cheap price . however , second unit we got leaked water base during its first use ; so , it went back amazon very same day it arrived our home . this product so dangerous . without exercising some safety precaution , it cause electrocution !	-1
i saw commercial , i read reviews - so i bough one box walmart . it not worth it , that my conclusion . trays made very thin plastic-like material , very difficult position properly your teeth . active gel easy goes out trays , fills your mouth . during first couple od uses , after 20 min or so i started feel vague pain my gum . nevertheless , i continued using product all 7 days , advertised , 30 min day . after whole package gone , change color my teeth barely visible . i hope you better luck .	-1
i really like my electric toothbrush oralb so i thought i would like this too . however , it just doesn't work . cartridges they set up don't work because soon you tug them all , floss becomes loose therefore won't vibrate - it only vibrates if it taut . but because way they cartridges set up , there no way make it taut again . it would worked if instead they used roll floss let you feed it through yourself needed , but they too greedy wanted sell lots cartridges . this would ok if you got lots use out cartridges , but my experience they broke halfway through single use . so ... forget it	1
these nothing me . ask your doctor aphthasol , prescription drug approved fda -- which means it passed rigorous government testing standards . aphthasol changed my life	-1

while one would think it would impossible foul up such simple common tool , manufacture indeed so . " spoon " portion this shoe horn attached heavy coil . i supposed this intended give working end some flexibility , but instead using fastener or weld , its just rolled metal inserted into coil . after only two uses " spoon " came out coil even though i could easily enough put it back together , after couple more uses it became so loose it would not stay . basically its now shoe horn minus twenty something inch handle now . would recommend buying more simply designed , single piece shoe horn .	-1
like fading light . would like sound effects ... if they worked ! out box sound effects not work . now mess calling manufacturer fix or get it replace . such hassle	1
i very happy my purchase . company chose mail it me via priority mail order it arrive before christmas . i very pleased !!!!	-1

conair just really not make great hair straighteners . i bought full size one before , without warning it just quit working after 2 months . i revlon full-size one now ( which works great ) . i recently got my hair cut short , so i decided go buy cheap small one reach short hair back . turn turbo , blast it up highest temperature , it still not even half hot my revlon one thats turned minimum . i really thin hair , its not even curly it just gets wavy sometimes . this thing cant even straighten much	-1

there so many different sites all tell you ' they ' best absorbed coenzyme q10 manufactured . it hard know who really telling absolute truth or just propagandizing product quick sale . we born extremely high levels coenzyme q10 then it gets slowly used up years pass even if we actually eat foods resupply our bodies . who purposefully eats these foods coenzyme q10 content ? mitochondria every single cell our body needs this coenzyme production energy . time we over 40 , our levels dropped significantly our energy levels dropped it . i must admit this nature made product not seem increase my energy level like other company coenzyme q10 . so , my own reaction this product , i not recommend this particular coenzyme q10 . there several other companies make excellent , effective products ( like dr. whitaker dr. sinatra dr. william ) but not this nature made product	-1

pedometer great ! easy use , accurate . highly recommend it	1
i owned this pulse meter approximately 2 weeks i find it accurate , but it takes while it give reading . first few times i used it , it took over minute tell me my pulse . however , manual state when you become used correct positioning your finger sensor it give result faster . so far , this true , within last 3 days , i received readings within 10 seconds consistently . considering price , it good purchase	1

my wife high bp , so we got this model . reasons choosing this model : 1 . upper arm monitors supposed more accurate2 . it cheaper than fully automatic models3 . omron seems one better/best brands . 4 . supposedly , pumps fully automatic models prone breaking . unit appears well built ( including hand pump ) . it easy operate , it seems very accurate . we checked its readings fully manual unit we home , automatic unit drug store . we find it takes very accurate consistent readings . people physical limitations might find hand pump inconvenient . also , people big arm might need buy larger cuff . i'm overweight right now , so cuff barely fits my arm , but fits my wife nicely ( it bought her )	1
my grandfather found vial old spice his navy kit when he joined 1943 . he continued using it after war my father picked it up when he himself came age . i began shaving ten years ago choice obvious : old spice conservative masculine , distinct time-honored . it not trend ; it statement manhood . if proctor amp ; gamble obliges , my own grandkids using it	1
i love this . everyone their own data we track our own progress . it very simple use explanations clear	1
this great iron starter , but not it like stylist . i it least 2 years so it last also . price little bit high i only paid $ 19.99 it walmart . i know everyone gotten used shopping online because it eay always open , but i tell you most things i found amazon priced way high . they used great spot get good stuff cheap but no longer true . i think it just kind creeped up us without us noticing what going . please folks go back out world start looking you see i am not wrong	1

my wife i both love this . our opinion thicker plastic tines offer more comfortable pleasurable " head trip " than trippers one might find mall . vibrations make it better than non-vibrating head trippers but not overwhelming . benefit this particular device it able completely disassembled packed taken you travelsor vacations . it pretty simple device , sold reasonable cost , my opinion better implementation than metal ones	1
it great job , i just tought it woundn't let any hair go , but i gess that impossible	1
it nice if you looking simple hair dryer . it its job pretty nicely . dual voltage option plus you use it anywhere world . little big travelling , but compromises its folding handle light weight . disadvantage you cant use it high 240 voltage . it hard because you might tend put it high then would kill equipment	1

what i wanted christmas something turn my bath tub into whirlpool , my boyfriend bought this me . bubbles no doubt amazing , they're plenty strong even lowest setting . massage part , i didn't use too much- it just vibrates some , bubbles seemed more massaging than vibrating massager . only thing i not really care it kind difficult keep tub floor . it suction cups , but they didn't work too well- everytime i moved my feet or legs , it wanted float top water . overall , i'd say this pretty good gift ! i definitely use it many more times	1
i love these little bibs . i say little , because even though they size regular cloth bibs , big size bibsters , which i also bought , huge , cover my 9mo . old baby almost past his diapers . i reluctant buy bibsters first , because they seemed such waste material disposable- i guess they -- however , they serve good purpose they extremely light thin fully waterproof , so my super-drooler doesn't get his outfits totally wet like he his cloth bibs , which i'm frequently switching out . bibsters also very easy pack into diaper bag , i'm never without bib . i've also using big size bibsters my 2yr old car , random snack spills . these not really reusable , but i sometimes use them 2 meals , depending how clean they . price right when amazon grocery spend 50 get 10 dea	1
clippers excellent quality cut well . we poodle very thick hair . if you take your time , these clippers wonderful job	1
i love smell essential oil air . i've tried tealight burners , smear low-burning lamp , miniature crockpot designed aromatherapy . pearlessence spa mist absolutely best ever diffusing odor continuing diffuse it extended period time . because i live humid climate , i concerned misting would only add mold problems perhaps mar wooden furniture . cool mist instantly absorbs even into our air . light show base turned off , but i like it most time . product offered $10 less than well-known local natural market chain , shipping free my order over $25 other products .	1
really strong when just sprayed , but after little while it gets soft , but same time not too soft . perfume lasts few hours , time i go bed , scent would still there faintly , i fall asleep it . it fresh strong first , then soft sweet . love it	1
if you don't like getting attention , these not you . i'm often surprised people astonished reactions act putting them taking them off ; i'm so accustomed pulling them apart , i forget how unusual viewing public finds it . i wearing clics nearly year . i pretend i don't need glasses , but course i nearly decade . popped standard diopter lenses out , put my bifocal prescription . it worked great , despite warning my optical shop . ( even if they broken experiment , price right : i could try it again . ) previously i wearing glasses chain . besides various difficulties noted reviewer , i also found plastic loops connect chain arms glasses bad habit stretching . then glasses slip off chain inappropriate times frames break . i call color mine " magenta " - which may or may not same online " red " - i bought them shop (** gasp **) . my short hair not problem , but i agree reading bed doesn't work . so i use different pair those occasions	1

after 3 months use , i'm buying two more these my daughters . unit compact , very sturdy , virtually silent , puts out plenty mist even low setting . small tank light easy fill , even bathroom sink ( many people really wrestle those one gallon tanks ) yet it easilly lasts through 8 hour work day or nights sleep . key feature it small quiet . means it near you desk top or night table . mist nearer you less ambient air means less condense cold windows ( cause mildew ) . it also means you use low setting which makes small tank last longer reduces any risk vapor droplets settling table top . if you want use high setting , put unit top book shelf , dresser or file cabnit allow longer path mist settle . this small light enough take road dry hotel rooms . one daughter wants one her dorm room , which overheated . unit easily moved bedroom den or wherever you locate during day . you would not find this convenient large ( gallon ) humidifiers . this unit also inexpensive , around $30 which half cost many larger models ( so you get two ) . after using several evaporative humidifiers , i love not spending $6 - $9 month paper replacement wicks . overall , i am delighted unit . only criticsm blue led too bright dark room . this easily dimmed putting piece masking or adhesive tape over it . light helpful avoid bumping unit if you reach phone or tissue dark night . it also lights up mist so you know there still water chamber . highly recommended .	1
this product works great water retention . i like it doesn't keep you running ladies room , works great	1
this well-made device useful , though limited , value . it usefulness derives its consistency , which amazing . given your body composition varies throughout day , particularly your level hydration , omron measurements vary only fractions percent - exactly what you would expect . it measures small electric currents running one electrode , through your body , second electrode . omron programmed estimate your body fat measuring impedance your body flow electricity . so , one might think such measurement would straightforward , like weight scale . electricity encounters fat , muscle , bone , fluids omron interprets current displays your body fat percent . right ? after all , when you step scale , scale responds showing your weight . you don't need tell scale whether you think you athlete or how old you . it simply measures your weight . well , omron doesn't work way , nor other similar devices , nor skin-fold calipers . it looks me though electrical skin-fold devices all simply measure surface body fat . then they require you input other data , such your activity level ( " normal " or " athlete " omron case ) age . this not good because it introduces general population averages into what should specific measurements you . instance , regardless your body , it assumed older you , more internal fat you . resulting body fat estimates dramatically different when factoring those variables . omron ( calipers ) still useful , though , if you consider it compass rather than scale . you can't sure it tell you where you , but , over time , it tell you where you going .	1

i tried several " energy bars " found hooah best doing what it says it , give me steady energy . most other energy bars i tried , pick me up then knock me down few hours later . i feel confident feeding them my family too . my 8 year old son races motocross eats one before each moto . my daughter eats one before cheering football games before her 4 hours dance lessons . my husband , contractor/builder , eats one before hectic work day . i keep up all them sometimes don't time breakfast or lunch , i just grab hooah bar i am set . they like bread milk our house , if we out , everyone mad mom . since we several friends family members armed forces , we also like fact portion each sale goes military . thanks hooah !	1

i never eaten luna bar before i made this purchase , so i expectations not even close fufilled . when i read " chocolate pecan pie " .. i expected just .. taste rich chocolate , nutty pecans gooey sugary base . what i received bar little taste , nothing all similar name bar . my opinion , bar edible if you no expectations it ... flavor barely there . bar dry . it never again my " purchase " list	-1
this high powered toothbrush helps you brush better . however , it not magic . you still know " how brush . " it also much more messy , using this kind toothbrush , but dental hygenists strongly recommend them	1
first shave seemed good ; but second time me fusion . instead just one nick , i managed around 3 or 4 nicks once . but looking cost replacement cartridges enough shock look cheaper alternative shaving . i purchased merkur futur german made adjustable safety razor it only costs 40 cents or less each merkur razor blade they alot sharper ! merkur heavy duty safety razor supposed great beginners safety razor also highly rated ! one even get 100 blade bulk packs derby extra double edge blades merkur ebay which average just around 16 cents or less apiece . sensor more practical me ! my opinion , gillette must think we all willing pay high prices these fusion blades new modern 4 bladed shave . lately , there seems trend more men going back good old fashioned shave using double edge safety razor ! i wonder why ?	-1
i offered one these while cycling thought it very tasty . so good , fact , when i got home i went straight web site show back wrapper learn where i could buy them . just above web address nutrition ingredients list . probably mistake manufacturer part it gives you something read while site comes up . oops ! this bar whooping 25% your daily allowance saturated fat ! not only , but fat palm oil . this might acceptable soldier involved prolonged strenuous activity but i doubt cardiologist would recomend it most us . commercially formulated product more likely fill average person need lower fat ( healthier fat ) energy bar , than one formulated extreme physical activity , sold profit marketed patriotic tribute troops . bottom line : read label , weigh health risks if you want support troops , there better way than eating hooah bars .	1
i finally found product works me , after trying too many other products . i tried magic shave powder but couldn't use it no more than once month ( damn thing reeked , too ) . if i didn't get all hairs , i'd toast . i would use razor finish job , which defeated purpose not getting ingrown hairs . i tried magic shave creamer , didn't work either . i would get most my beard , but if there anything left over , i'd same position use razor finish . i tried norelco ( received christmas ) but couldn't deal my hairs pulled ( ouch !! ) . i bought beard trimmer wahl cut my beard skin , then used magic shave razor . it worked but still got razor bumps ( not bad ) sometimes bled . i vacationing florida my friends who visited his sister brother-in-law . his brother-in-law happened neighborhood barber , he used this razor my face . i got so enamored , went i got back i went online bought it immediately . since i know my face very well , i realized i only use this shaver most twice week . i used this since february 2006 , it wonderful . i give it four stars because , even though it works like product says , i get little bump here there . all all , i recommend this product men suffers in-grown hairs . please note , after reading other reviews , usage individualized . other words , know what your limits terms how many times you use shaver . you might able use it daily or weekly	1

i've tried lot energy bars this best tasting . i am however partial peanut butter . cliff bars my favorite , but these taste much better bit crisp them . cliff bar dry tasting comparison . i would given this bar 5 stars it not used palm oil . this ups saturated fat , which i need watch . corn surup not best thing ingesting either but since i am working out burning it off its proabably not problem . this bar lowest sat . fat ( 2g , 10%rda ) than their other two bars most potasium . later important me because it may help ward off my leg cramps . i agree vitamins probably marketing ploy - after all , anyone who exersizes regularly probably takes multivitamin . i'd give it 4-1/2 stars if i could .	1

my first impression this heating pad , " great ! " it large enough wrap around sore shoulder well down back , it nice controls four heat settings , turns off after hour or so ( safety ) . unfortunately , it only 3 weeks before it stopped working . i exchanged it unit ( thought maybe it fluke ) . replacement lasted two months almost daily use , then died . it appears controller simply burns out . i would not recommend this heating pad	-1
we bought this thinking it would great product . we able get steam out it awhile , but we nurse it . times it drained out onto carpet ; other times it produced no steam . even nusing it , humidifier broke down after three months now we can't use it all . hope others better luck it than we .	1

okay , let see if i write this review so not offend amazon fastidious editors ... guys , if you want plug-in massager please your wife or girl friend , hitachi magic wand what you need . however -- gals , if you want plug-in massager please your husband or boy friend -- panasonic ev2510k one ! why ? because panasonic more powerful than hitachi , its hard plastic roller head better suited man , um , contours . addition , panasonic quiet causes no video interference , selling point case you augment your " massage " sessions some video stimulation ... only reason i don't give panasonic five stars previous " panabrators " proven less than reliable ; typically they seem last year before they conk out . still , get ev2510k , you'll most enjoyable year	1
we this product 2 months . it alleviated my sinus issues quite bit . it not only keeps air too dry , it keeps room lit nicely . its perfect amount light see if you want get up night , but not so bright it keeps you awake . i also like it refilled daily because i am always misting fresh water into air	1
i little worried this one , based price , but it worth it . yes , epilator painful , so if you don't want pain then don't buy one . you won't get completely smooth skin right away , it'll take more than one session over course few weeks , but hair you remove won't come back thick or densely . i recommend using skin guard if you're doing your underarms , since skin more sensitive there	1

schick top name razors overall but it also always lead competition its silk effects razor . while silk effects still demand , schick came out quattro women , probably compete gilette venus , this " newer " razor lives up its competition many ways . women using their husbands ' razors ages because they shave more accurately more precision so it only makes sense simply modify man razor fit woman , which exactly what schick this produc t.t his razor even feels like it something more substantial than your basic woman razor because one its main elements : metal . unlike other plastic razors , this razor feels ( looks ) much more substantial , perhaps because it feels tougher heavier ; it not razor i would readily throw away - nor would i want both razor replacement blades cost quite bit even if prices par other leading razors . it feels more like man razor . , one might argue it but even elements regular quattro considered improvement over regular female razors . both quattro quattro women boast 4 precise blades , metal handle which might actually help shaving accuracy , comfort grips . quattro women gives us something little more . obviously , it " feminized " changing colour black pink but this razor also pivoting head make shaving feminine curves easier conditioning strip . enough advertising , though . this good razor . if it not #1 market then it #2 without doubt good reason . i shave many parts my body i always get least good shave , if not better , quattro . i find this razor works best certain parts my body , however , i not giving up my venus anytime soon . while i get good shave my legs underarms , i prefer use this razor my bikini line bikini area . i find areas prone razor bumps rash shave much more nicely not become irritated my quattro but areas shaved fine my venus , not seem shave smoothly quattro . this blade seems dull fairly easily well , though perhaps it because i tend use it more dense hair . you really cannot stretch it out " just one more " shave . when it dulls , razor bumps irritation increase almost exponentially , more than once , numerous blades " tugged " my hair skin . there other elements quattro worth discussing than just quality shave , however . this razor comes handy , compact suction cup holder stick your shower wall or door . although sometimes it seems fall , it usually holds up well quite improvement over bulky holder venus . nevertheless , this holder not any place store your extra razor blades . furthermore , you wouldn't want store your blades your shower case they , those sleek it , not entirely enclosed moisture deteriorate moisture strips blades . therefore , if you're like me remember you need change your blade only once you shower , you'll jump out shower it . however , my complaints really not overshadow this quality product . it still top line , since i purchased it , i extremely pleased quality though i still continue use my venus some parts my body	1
