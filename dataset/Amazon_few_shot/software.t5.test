im computer literate regularly use number varying programs visio logic audio ms office . after picking up illustrator however , im frustrated lack intuition steep learning curve software offers . ive told world revolves around 2 types people : those who " get " vector graphic programs , those who errrr ... dont . unfortunately , after 10 hours use much manual reading , i fall into later category . i dont plan give up however plan enroll course . this decision supported friends proficient its use - but who difficulty demonstrating complex concepts me . ( indeed , defining direction drawn curve intuitive metaphsyics or nuclear science ! )so my advice this : extremely carefull if youve never used illustrator before . it may breeze those well versed its use , but absoloute beginner its extremely difficult program grasp you may dissapointed find this out after youve forked out your hard earned dollars it .	-1
i thought this would good product my computer . i didn't know only way receive this product over internet via download . during process prompts internet download ask you remove ( uninstall/delete ) all your known antivirus , spyware , firewalls your computer prior install . this leaves your computer susceptible when you receive error message . i received error message prevented me completing download . i purchased software aug 3 called customer support , they researched problem even took remote access my computer try fix issue . they unable so then passed me second level computer technicans . microsoft guards its secrets well varying levels technical support , those know basics those know more . they asked me set up time span when i would like receive call " teir ii " agents , i chose 6-9pm . i received several calls over next two weeks , all them outside specified time . i missed several them because i career life . when i finally spoke agent they again took over remote access my computer also unable solve issue . here it , two weeks after i purchased software , i still not what i needed . i also unable surf web because download process requires you delete all antivirus firewall software . i called several times druing ordeal " teir i " agents just told me i wait call , " they'll get it when they get it . " i very upset customer support , i no idea how product , but customer support just horrible . go windows live onecare home page search " post your own thoughts " page through member accounts , you'll see i'm not alone this issue . i since purchased other software cover what microsoft says it onecare . i not one problem these installs . please aware you might purchase technical support if you cannot download due problem your operating system ( seperate onecare ) . this costs additional $35 ontop cost onecare	-1

i used ms streets trips 2005 2006 over year . it some map errors i wish updated . i read delorme street atlas far superior , so i bought it . it only took one day me find mountain problems . not only mapping way out date ( many years ) microsoft streets trips 2006 maps far more up date . many occasions told me turn wrong direction roads even when road doesn't exist direction . it doesn't even know name some very old roads displays ... " unknown name " while driving very old established roads it tells me turn onto road actually elevated overpass i am driving 30 feet below . program actually wanted me get back freeway making u-turn off ramp ramp . i used microsoft streets all these same areas it much more usable . delorme very confusing frustrating . i'm sending it back full refund	-1

i purchased quickbooks 2005 ; 4th upgrade 10 years . unlike earlier versions , this one confusing painful use . simple things like making deposits through contraptions . one reasons i upraded use online banking ; it complete disaster . it doesn't download complete trasaction details , reconcilliations very difficult . you doing twice work use it . once my transfer bank aborted message saying you low memory though quickbooks sent transaction bank , it didn't mark it internally , so next login , it sent payment again !!! it cost me $1509 double payment i am still trying get back ! how you pay bill totally messed up , there no way you mark bill paid online unless it through quickbooks online connection . ( bank billpay can't used!!)it very poor organization , you can't 2 accounts # vendor ( still 2005 !!! ) . it introduced obscure concepts items classes , which no real definition no " default " use stop every transaction . one biggest thing quickbooks hurt their customers payroll . technically you it yourself , but they hide information scare you every step you should ( must ) buy $299/year payroll service ( old tax-tables ) . all documenation , not once they mention you payroll directly this how . compared earlier products , this huge cost . reckoning i would paid ~ $2000 previous version quickbooks!!it definitely cheaper buy basic version software use accountant other work you better off . don't waste money quicken services or premium products , they bleed you death your way mental asylum	-1
i'm responsible 10 computers our organization . last year we purchased norton antivirus 2006 . it such resource hog it stopped our older computers ( 550 mhz ) working i uninstall all computers . after reading reviews said 2007 leaner , i tried install this 6 computers . only 1 install went without problems . installing three other computers took 3 days , i'm still not through computer 5 . sometimes program won't install . once it crashes during install , it leaves behind broken code prevents reinstall unless you use norton uninstall tool , which removes all norton products . so addition uninstalling reinstalling antivirus , you also reinstall norton ghost or any other norton products . computer i'm still fighting install went smoothly , but during update program hung up now i can't open norton antivirus . even worse , when i open word document , norton antivirus starts scanning document freezes computer . what nightmare	-1

new product release worthless - too buggy slow work . previous releases ok - they find some malware removed it , without interference our system . however , despite cute-sy interface , there other software programs provide same ( or better ) anti-malware support . most importantly , this company some shady business practices ( like hidden yearly automatic renewal charges , installing google toolbar download , etc ) no way contact them directly other than their online contact form which never receives response . check out better business bureau see their " unsatisfactory " report . i am currently disputing charge this company my debit card huge problems - so far i only able speak bridget their third-party billing company who says they not able provide assistance my complaint . there other , more reputable companies work . this type software not worth hassle	-1

after researching few options market i tried kaspersky internet security suite 6.0 . i needed only anti-virus but since rebates made whole suite cost same anti-virus alone i decided give it try . man , i really disappointed . out 7 programs only 2 started working properly : anti-virus proactive defense . suite trying start other 5 programs requesting reboot laptop constantly . after trying all i could i decided call or email help . this where i got my surprise - none contact information led me any live person . i emailed all addresses available net program . i called all us numbers i could - they even don't live representative here . if you try call number us canada you reach one those accept all calls leave your numbers wait all you response time . i filled out two bug reports directly program same result . one selling points anti-virus program hourly updates . well , guess what . you lucky daily update without manual interaction . i thought something wrong my work laptop installed second program ( i na�ve bought two ) brand new installation windows xp . result absolutely identical . if you don't believe me - try contact any their support ( not sales ) channels before you buy their product . my final view this product would : 1 . great idea2 . maybe great initial implementation ( reviews great)3 . unavailable support . don't waste your time money	-1

don't buy vista -- any version , yet . ms released it way too early . some examples why : * too many hardware drivers not yet available , i.e. , creative audigy sound cards ; nvidia graphics cards , linksys wireless network components , just mention few . when i contacted product manufacturers , i sensed ho-hum attitude . moreover , some peripherals totally incompatible . example : my epson perfection 1650 scanner rejected vista , so i forced buy newer model ( epson perfection 4990 photo ) . hmmmm . one wonders whether these sorts incompatibilities result more design ( purposely ? ) than insurmountable technological deficiencies . * too many vista compatible application updates not yet available . * " upgrade " versions ms vista ( versus " full " versions ) seem full bugs . soon after i installed vista ultimate , i encountered major problem ms tech support trying resolve over two weeks . it so pervasive ms outlook 2007 affected extent some its features not available . it appears during installation process , something went awry " windows event log " " event viewer . " furthermore , latest version ( vista compatible ) diskeeper 2007 pro not launch , most likely same reason . * it appears ms went way overboard security features extent paranoia . every time you click just anything , pop-up appear asking your permission " allow " it launch . very annoying , very unnecessary . it though ms adopted underlying assumption throughout development process average end user iq 85 . * ms tech support quality deteriorated substantially . most time when you call you reach someone india . albeit these people very polite , they cannot think " outside box . " nor they touch sufficiently enough nuances english language , thus impairing expeditious understanding both sides conversation . based upon my recent experience these folks , i sense soccer mom could trained ms tech support rep very little time . what i mean this : during my multiple contacts them i developed feeling they rely totally reading manuals , scripts , on-line knowledge bases . other words , they seem not able analyze troubleshoot problems independent external references . * bottom line : not purchase vista until after service pack 1 released , or whatever they happen name their first major fix-it update package . now , stay more reliable xp versions . i truly regret i discover all this hard way . it very costly more ways than one .	-1

if you look my review history , you may note i've given very few five-star reviews . i save five stars outstanding products . i believe wordperfect x3 best described outstanding . long time ago , i used word perfect . however , my earlier jobs required i use ms word , so i my best become word guru . i believe i accomplished short creating custom macros . law clerk , i started new job where wordperfect standard . so , last year i bought wordperfect 12 . first it difficult , but i bought book helped me fill blanks . ability customize keyboards fact wordperfect gives author great degree control ( especially show-codes ) , i soon able become wordperfect guru . i remembered all things i used love wordperfect . like any lover , i also learned ignore some blimishes wordperfect . ( one those blemishes behavior pushing change point document forward , which , once you get accustomed it , really nice feature . ) wordperfect pdfs two accepted file formats electronic submission federal courts . there two complaints i found work among word devotees : 1 ) ability export pdf but not import 2 ) inability cut word document into wordperfect document without creating all formatting litter word likes use . 1 . we occasionally receive pdfs we would retype able make edits . ability import pdfs ( , those authored exported into pdf , not documents scanned into pdf ) , we now able edit those pdfs . this real time saver . since pdf de facto universal standard amongst all platforms ( windows , mac , unix ) , this great improvement . 2 . formatting litter real pain deal . i never could get ms word document just import into wordperfect without headaches trying fix formatting . my solution copy portion out ms word , paste into text file , copy again then paste into wordperfect . my complaint i could not just straight paste into wordperfect . well , corel heard my cry provided ability copy just text . lone ms word holdout my office capitulated . he no more complain . great thing wordperfect fact file format its documents not changed years ( i heard wp rep say no change since 1995 ) . why should it ? everything you could want document ( perhaps barring professional typesetting ) wordperfect . there no need create new format when one you just works . this product exactly what those who come love wp expect it . i think corel good job resolving my own personal quibbles wp . so , if you're looking solid performer seeks beat competition improving itself , wpx3 representative what you're looking	1
this truly killer application comic book collectors . you get comic whole run its auspicious origins 1961 its current incarnation end 2004 , tiny dvd you carry anywhere . thrill reading classical issues all their colored glory not missed , particularly those not reprinted so far . i especially enjoyed impossible man molecule man origin stories . seeing how particular adventures ended also great fun , since i owned some comics generally undistinguished 1980s , but didn't know how things turned out . able read entire john byrne run mid-eighties spectacular . it even better than his work x-men , almost cool lee-kirby years . this so much better than essentials , since it color so much cheaper , plus it includes original ads letter pages . it also beats masterworks series not only account price , but also because it original colors . it good owning complete collection , but it take up less space hence generate less nagging mothers or wives . this must item , perhaps best price/quality ratio i ever seen . it improved ? sure . why not take advantage possibilities computers create index all characters would allow reader see all appearances character over years ? why not create index writers artists , so one may quickly get view their work ? cross-referencing next step good people marvel must working . but there no reason wait . even it , this dvd not just good enough . it great , like fantastic four themselves	1

nero 6 wonderful product , but you need get legal copy full retail version , not oem cd or cd questionable origin . this time ( april 2006 ) best place get it ahead software website ( makers nero ) .

used vista off since release first public beta , i already become familiar interface time final version came out . menu computer browsing different xp , but no less functional . i think biggest complaints i heard seem based solely resistance change . change not bad thing , many cases web browsing interface makes things much more intuitive me . many flashy effects fun play day or two , but most now turned off divert resources productivity . my computer fast enough handle it all , but i tend prefer alot overhead my processing power . utilizing system monitors , i very seldom go above 60% cpu usage , even when rendering full 3d drawings auto cad , so i would tend disagree " system hog " classification . i also tried vista ultimate slower/older machines , see some slowing down system , so best warning here heed minimum requirements . most other issues i heard seem stem driver support , there several missing drivers pretty common pieces equipment . usually beta drivers available if you take some time look , it always advisable gather your drivers together onto single cd or external drive prior beginning any upgrade . all my software worked so far , exception palmone quick install my lexmark printer companion software . vista , it solid , reliable operating system so far proven secure free any major bugs . constant updates solve little problems time goes , enhance customization features allow you tweak system get rid anything slows you down or even annoys you . overall , i would call it far more solid than any previous version windows ( including xp sp2 ) . all-in-all it easy upgrade left me very little clean-up work when it complete . those calling it " rip-off " mac osx , you've obviously not spent much time working vista or osx . there some similarities user interface , but those primarily response user feedback what desired operating system . just because ford first car manufacturer use pneumatic tire , not mean others " ripping-off " their ideas when they too began use them . capitalistic society , market demands drive product features , vista example bringing more those demands os standard pc based systems . while it not polished os some might hoped , foundation solidly laid add-ons , upgrades , enhancements security functionality come over next few years . i also feel secure knowing these upgrades service packs included price i already paid . during same time , i know i buy several upgrades my mac around $130 each . real point this : " know what you getting into before you leap . " check compatibility all your hardware software before upgrading , know what you expect when upgrade complete . if you cannot live without certain piece your total system incompatible , not upgrade til compatibility worked out . simple ..	-1
