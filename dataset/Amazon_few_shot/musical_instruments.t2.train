i bought this item my son piano practice . it worked ok terms sound speed , until second day when on/off switch broke off . then i noticed plastic attachment switch very thin start . my opinion , this flaky product since on/off switch used many times every day so it sturdy .	1
cheap , cheap , cheap- i know you get what you pay , but 20 bucks(after shipping ) lot pay nothing return . thing didn't respond my guitar , store said it probably defective return it . but , you don't get repaid any shipping , so it hardly worth effort . buying this just resulted headache frustration .	-1
contrary vendor arrival date , one my items placed backorder nearly month . i not notified change only found out when i inquired phone . customer representative not apologize company not offer any form resolution inconvenience . first product arrived good shape on-time , but i am dissatisfied customer service when mistake made	1
i first ordered this guitar color after week checking mail my little boy every day , i informed it out stock . i re-ordered bodacious blue it came friday . it literally came cardboard box you would buy it off shelf no packing besides plastic bag around guitar like your newspaper would come . there no packaging slip . i took it out plastic body guitar damaged around edge . there little divit size raisin where it looked like it hit something pretty hard . there literally slack strings , so they tightened . it would not stay tune i would tighten strings you could see them loosen again immediately . my little boy began play out tune guitar sounded terrible next day one strings broke !!! this toy piece junk . sales pitch says fully functional guitar ... great value money .... hahaha ! i thought this would great starter guitar little investment . i would only recommend this if you needing prop or decoration some kind . it certainly isn't playable ! i no slip send it back what i would pay shipping would probably near what i paid thing . don't waste your money !	-1
this item cheap junk i bought this item when i got it it didn't work after hours fiddling it it finally worked but sound terrible when i pulled plug out back after day it said it chargable but it wasn't it would not work without plug attached it when i started play it it kept making this annoying banjo like sound it wouldn't stop you not play any fast songs this because it can't keep up you not play more than one note time keys aren't really raised it just like pressing cell phone buttons plastic so cheep it almost broke when i pressed one button after shipping handling total $56 not buy this item cheap junk if you want roll up keyboard go look somewhere else	-1
1 . forget headphones , if you're interested playing guitar , you need actually hear what you play . so , replace them , first thing . 2 . amplifier terrible , so if you want this thing just practice home ... well , supposing you care nothing sound then it ok . but then , why play guitar first place ? so , sum it up , if you play guitar , you respect yourself , spend some money buy something decent . this item you may want give away birthday present 7-year old	1
only song i know 12-string electric it rush xanadu , so i let ' er rip . sounded good . i alot fun playing around it . however , after hour or so goofing around i noticed two things really ticked me off . firstly , outer tines already broken . tines look like wound steel guitar string , but core very brittle . they didn't completely fall off , they just hung there like limp whatevers . secondly , plastic p'up cover pick guard looked like they scrubbed wire brush . i easily fix those , but i wonder what such abrasive pick strings if i play it alot . it looks like you only strum down stroke . videos jellyfish website confirm this . problem you're going against grain upstroke it catches strings . how much fun it only play down strokes ? it kind hard grasp , too . it needs thumb dimple . i'm going make one using more flexible wound guitar stings see if its any better . if you've got $10 blow , go ahead get one	-1
you know how when regular pick hits your strings , you hear sound it hitting string , then after it releases string reverberates you hear note ? well imagine hearing 15 picks hit string before string produces music . 15 picks made coiled wire . i can't imagine worse sound or feeling .	-1

i very disappointed this product . it child yet wood string holder not even attached guitar . this product lasted whole two days before part fell off you could no longer use guitar . tuners also unable tighten so you basically piece useless wood shaped like guitar .	-1

videos amazing ! i would say better than amazing . riffs , solos taught fun work well level they correspond , i feel progresses well beginner beyond consistant speed . only problem ... there grey area overlaps term beginner intermediate so you may skip around lessons get track course . instance i decided learn riffs practice pull offs beginner dvds go straight into intermediate levels course beginner sections where way easy . but i would say if powerful riffs electrifying solos your passion then i know no other course get you there quicker while more fun doing it	1
shure sm58 one most recognisable microphones world - good reason . it main stay many hire companies microphone hire stock , including mine ( pa2hire.co.uk ) . practically unbreakable , if you manage drop it high stage / skyscraper , you also buy replacement pop shield . very suited rock , or other musical styles need powerful vocals . make sure your singers lips touching pop shield get best results , though , unless they very good mic technique . proximity effect ( increase bass when you sing or talk close mic ) makes this important . if singer foot away sm58 , chances they sound thin , you also gain before feedback issues .... sonically response nice presence peak upper mid range , but top end rolls off quickly after . opinion split whether good or bad thing - it helps keep lid feedback , but it doesnt sound hi-fi some other mics . i some singers complain their vocal top end not quite right - sometimes asking more top end . i guess they used sound expensive condenser mics their recordings . my solution normally give them mic , like beta 58 , or beta 87a maybe , rather than use eq . if you a/b test sm58 verses these mics it always lose . but it still better mic some cases , such when you looking cardioid rather than hyper-cardioid response ( sm58 cardioid response , which means it wider pickup pattern front ) . but most vocalists more than happy sound sm58 gives . sm58 also pretty good job drums ( not really bass drum ) , other loud things like guitar cabs . it uses same capsule sm57 , one best mics guitar cabs . conclusion , yes there lot mics sound better , some these quite bit cheaper - but ask yourself question they durable sm58 , if you professional , your clients want use mic they never heard ? take care , justin millerpa2hire . co . u	1
when i got my sr60 i immediately put it . headphones comfortable easily adjusted my head . i noticed foam fairly large cells it . my only previous experience this type foam not good , deeriorating very quickly but i am hoping these last longer . sound quite clean balanced . most phones this price range , there lack base . i able compare these side side sr80 , i may paid difference price get bit more base . overall , i rate these very good fairly priced	1
i finally caved sprung pair these headphones over weekend . after few days , i say i am truly impressed . i bought returned many pair headphones after dissatisfied . i not doing so these . accordingly , i'll try write some comments could help other people their purchase . there few things keep mind when selecting headphones . it also important keep mind any headphones , sound quality depends quality medium which you listening , well ability device drive headphones . my immediate impression sr60'swas bass bit weak ( matching few other comments here ) high-end treble bit subdued well - but after few days trying different kinds music listening different players , i decided neither weak all ; sounds simply much more accurately reproduced than most headphones i'd previously experienced . very significant : these headphones maintain almost identical tonal balance regardless listening volume . i've never encountered before , used headphones sound more " bright " or " warm " volume increases . i believe most budget headphones , if they aren't completely lacking bass , tend exaggerate certain frequencies beyond what you'd hear live performance . here my logic : i tried listening few different tracks sr60s , all high-bitrate mp3s : -- pride prejudice soundtrack ( 2005 ) - dario marianelli - " liz top world " - ( orchestral , dominated piano strings ) - any concerns weak bass blown out door within 30 seconds . it honestly sounded like * real piano * sitting my living room . who knew string section could so much ambiance ? i used appreciate this track its music ; notes carry lot emotion . i now understand what people mean appreciating particular * performance * well . -- alison krauss union station - " lucky one " - ( vocal , bluegrass ) - you clearly discern * specific * guitar picks , streaking noises made musicians ' fingers they slide up down strings ... alison krauss ' crystal clear voice just shines . it sounds like live performance . -- max graham feat . jessica jacobs - " i know you re gone " ( original mix ) - ( vocal trance ) - i've much ballyhooed this track one all time best examples vocal trance . it also good sound testing song , since it based throbbing bass line bouncy rhythms , but breaks down into section where it just jessica voice , piano , strings . i must listened this song 200 times last year , yet i picked up several new nuances first listen these headphones . few negatives these headphones , now i've played them : -- yes , they bulky . you probably won't want use them gym . i able tolerate them treadmill , but actually lifting weights or otherwise doing things requiring changes posture , i'll probably stick my koss ksc75 ( awesome bargain themselves less than $20 , though now i've tried grados , koss bass seems bit artificially inflated ) . -- these * really * leak sound . whim , i spun headphones put them so outside my ears , foam pads facing outward . they actually sounded louder way ( if muffled ) than drivers properly facing my ears . open air design it advantages - i think it partly how these headphones create illusion sitting among musicians - but people around you may think you blasting your music even if it isn't really loud you . -- these headphones * * expose flaws source media , possibly your playback device well . i can't stomach 128kbps mp3s anymore . when your headphones get this accurate , such music seems life flattened out it . i tried listening few beatles songs , there certain frequencies missing . it sounded like i listening reel-to-reel tape . oh wait , songs probably mastered reel-to-reel . my overall impression extremely favorable . sure , sound quality somewhat subjective matter , but if your goal life-like sound , you want come closer what studio recording sounded like , these headphones awesome effort price .	1
this great product money . novice , it easy use . instructions pretty thin but it simple figure out . useful tool	1
my wife bought 3 small children zithers amazon , none them tune - so i picked up this wonderful reasonably priced item put them tune good order . it very simple setup , easy follow directions . within 10 minutes each , i all 3 zithers tune ' zeveral ' ( ahem ! ) 5 year olds treating me ' my darling clementine ' 3-way stereo .....	1
someone who knows nothing guitars how tune them , this tuner " must " ! came w/batteries ( aaa ) clear instructions . 1)turn 2)pick string 3)adjust until you get correct note . once i looked up correct notes , it simple . it even tell me if i'm playing correct cord . i tried tune listening beginner cd trying replicate sound they suggest , but computer speakers , it just doesn't work . this little tuner rocks !	1
this drum set awsome affordable . it nice clean but deep sound , works any type music . but since america now scared reading , it seems people neglecting notice while picture cymbols , it clearly printed it not come cymbals . 5 star though	1
i ordered this guitar my 4 yr old grandson xmas after he became interested my guitar . company fantastic job it shipped received time xmas . guitar surprising detailed not like those plastic ones you see stores fishing line strings .. these real steel strings extra string just case . only draw back so far keeping one strings taunt . there adjustment screw back each tuning peg but if you constantly tighten it , it becomes loose .. overall my grandson completely amused his " tar " spends hours playing us songs ... thank	1
after long spell out society i advised best way get back touch my fellow man through medium music . my parole officer advised me creative activities such playing instrument tend show us how cultured worthwhile lives humans , rather than looking one fellow man fetid putrid beast . i always enjoyed listening music whilst not equipped learn any complex instrument percussion definitely where it me ! i purchased this pulse triangle means beginning road becoming next phil collins or ringo star . i found pulse triangle easy use rewarding results . i am able add my own accompaniment most tunes , fleetwood mac ' albatross ' nirvana ' smells like teenspirit ' . i some trouble mastering later higher tempo tunes tend difficult keep up . my girlfriend likened me epileptic gymnast she watched me playing william tell overture . summary if you looking way into music want simple instrument tests water then pulse triangle you . it cheap , enjoyable very forgiving . however it not recommended playing naked	1
mic cheap , stand nice but what combo deal ! i likes i like	1
this excellent buy built-in sound system . we bought it our church , everyone extremely pleased it . we couldn't believe we got whole package less than $30 including shipping ! everything plugged perfectly , no adapters needed . service amazing , too ; it here two days after we ordered . thanks	1
metronome everything i expected . i wanted metronome very loud so it could heard while playing ensemble also one volume control . sound loud enough heard while playing ensemble good volume control . it not digital so one easily switch tempos . it light enough easily carried around . what i would liked , but not expect tempo range goes beyond 40 - 208 . unfortunately , seeems found only digital .	1
we've tried several brands metronomes , now our family two seiko sq-50s use . best feature clicks you hear crisp quality sound not irritating like other metronomes we tried . it so easy use , even youngest child it . size just right -- small enough fit beside music music stand or piano , but large enough it not easily lost	1
this first metronome we owned so can't really compare others . but this one reliable very easy our daughter use . it loud which good her hear over her piano playing . headset option great when we , parents simply cannot distraction . our daughter much more solid practice session result this metronome . only drawback dial only includes certain tempo markings .... very wide range , but not every number . this not pose significant problem . though when piano teacher advises practice tempo marking this not we forced accommodate . but otherwise , very good	1
i bought used flames strap eddie it feels ( looks ) great . i love it my bro well , very good buy	1
nice mic great price . however , it doesn't include pop filter which essential . i shocked find these filters cost much mic	1
i two these because they're so cheap use them mainly home if i musical idea . one reviewers above mentioned it bit muddy which i totally agree . but it incredibly cheap fairly detailed amount money . i'm curious how it hold up over years use . anyway , this probably perfect " step-up " mic podcasts if you currently recording your computer built-in mic or radio shack dynamic mic . i would choose this over m-audio mics- it feels slightly more durable	1
some reason i tend shred most regular picks very quickly . this pick nickel plating lasts long time . also gives nice sound	1
im no pro but once you get these bongos tune them , they sound nice . i jam them all time quality gets better better skins thin out , sound comes out lot more . definitely worth 20 bucks	1
this nice harmonica convenient hard case . it good size ( like old marine band ) , it plays easily , good tone . only problem couple notes keep sticking won't play . i wedged them open but they stuck again . oh well , it still nice	1
i started playing harmonica earlier this year couple supercheap hohner products , then picked up this one . it costs more , but it worth it . it loud , clear notes , good playing single notes , two-draw uniquely warm friendly . superior marine band , golden melody , lee oskar .	1
i'm playing lee oskar right now . love it .... o yea ! i play nothing else . hohner good , but give me lo any day . they so airtight , sound so sweet .	1
this decent harmonica decent harmonica player .. if you haven't played many harmonicas you're generally beginner then i recommend this harmonica you but if you play pretty good , you deserve something better than this ... it dosen't go too loud dosen't clearest quality but price what you expect ? even if it dosen't clearest quality , it still decent quality , it great it price even if it cheap ... so , highly recommended beginner that why i gave it 4 out 5 stars	1
lee oskar harp plays well . easy keep clean plastic body constructed maintainability which improve overall lifetime harp	1
i've seen tuners come go , mostly high cost . i bought this tune both my guitars my violin , so far it hasn't let me down . i thought i good ear tuning but this little gadget quickly corrected me now my guitar sounds better than ever ... highly recommended	1
this tuner makes it pretty easy tune ( it jack input microphone ) , but it doesn't much range . tolerance seems only step or setp-anna-half , so if your strings off more than , you'll tune ear little first	1
celluloid guitar picks burn like dickens . it totally cool : just hold lighter ' em they go up flash ! careful not hold them your fingers , though , because fire very hot it burn you . just remember " fire bad ! " you won't go too far wrong . if you're looking picks play guitar , celluloid worthless . they're fragile , surface far too slick if your hands sweat all . try tortex or delrins . tortex business , my experience . i should note every one guitar picks mentioned this review fully compatible all major operating systems except cpm/80 old incompatible time-sharing system mit , except delrins , which create sort tesla-coil effect when used one's-complement integer systems . but you don't run into those very often these days so it not big issue . besides , it looks cool .	1
i use em practice , they're cheap nice picks , look pretty cool too	1
i own couple tambourines , but played few . this one light , bright kinda cool looking . inward placement handle allows it played windshield wiper style , wrist , or combination both allowing great speed variety . you also get two different soundings hits whether you use inner or outer ring . hit inner ring more open sound outer more dry close one . all all nice tambourine specially price	1
i bought program reason tutorial dvd simultaneously so i really not opportunity play software before viewing dvd . said i could not see using program effectively without dvd . this first true piece audio software i ever purchased so visual/audio aid guide me step step through process lifesaver . beginners standpoint dvd uses some terms unfamiliar kind hard grasp . but repeated viewings i am able make some great music . i would recommend this dvd anyone who purchased program reason	1
i purchased these strings through amazon affilaite telsonusa they excellent strings would cost three times much music stores .	1
years i used rat distortion boxes guitar bass . now i play bass lot more bands , find rat sound weak one dimensional . i sold off my rat tried out number other distortion boxes local shop settled big muff pi . this thing rich . complexity distortion incredible compared what you get most other pedals -- must brilliant russian engineering behind it . it three knobs : volume , sustain , tone . volume obvious , sustain really distortion level . bass , i run sustain very low , volume higher get great mix clean distorted tone . sometimes i run sustain knob turned all way off this thing still drives sound nicely . too much distortion bass you loose your ability cut through rest band my opinion . tone knob adjusts center frequency distortion . i run mine way over left distort low end around 200-400 khz . you crank it around get anything low grumbly distortion tall way really tinny irritating heavy metal sound . this thing versatile , no matter how you like your settings , distortion it produces rich harmonic overtones , multi-dimensional , unlike any other boxes i've tried . highly recommended . my only complaint this box designed work only battery power -- no ac adapter all . fortunately now there adapter one-spot connected battery lead then ac adapter . hopefully amazon start carrying soon .	1

this great sounding pair headphones , however , after couple uses right side headphone just stop receiving any sound . not sure problem , but i stated unit sounded great . that why 4 stars . refund received without any problem . not happy i pay shipping , which , why i not ask replacement	1
i purchased these 1 month ago used " burn " method leaving my grado running music 6 days straight open up components headphones good sound very impressed . i say they bit uncomfortable first but its worth it good sound fact pads adjust soften up after while . it also no where near painful my ordeal my first pair canalphones which e2c's(see my other reviews ) . anyways ... subject sound i say its all around winner its smooth but punchy bass its open soundstage which i guess results open ear design they , although some don't like retro look these phones i've really gettin into them late , big plus rotating cups thick cable which guarantee long life these cans . i also gotta give grado credit it expandability amps different cups which leave me hunting new components seeing i'm merely just budding audiophile long way go limited budget wont let me upgrade my setup whenever i want(cries ) ... . . if you use these your computer there pops hisses its because grado too good card which resulted me buying new 24bit external sound card creative gave me real boost sound quality . so overall these good pair cans someone who loves their music but just can't afford buy latest greatest world sound	1
price , i expected toy . i surprised open box find honest goodness classical guitar . construction , fit finish impeccable . sound certainly not concert quality , but expected $50 dollar instrument . tuning reasonably accurate , it pleasure play . i told me son it he going buy one his son .	1

these stands used schools , colleges , professionally least 45 years . they nearly industructible , very reliable , easy use . avoid clip lights ... they also decades old design . they only throw light top music very poor conditions such found musicals or opera .	1
grado world wide reputation best sound reproduction their cans ( audiophile speak headphones ) they awards back them up ! too often though , i've read reviews where comfort criticized these ear cushions allegedly blame . nonsense ! it true grado cans supraural ( ear ) opposed circumaural ( around ear ) so you feel unit against your ears . these cushions redesigned back 1998 , offering greater thickness distance transducer so you feel more comfortable while listening through your cans design allows greater soundstage magnificent grado cans impress you . these cushions , called " l-cush " here , used every single pair current grado cans except perhaps $1000 set . i use them my sr60 , which come standard foam cushion covers whole transducer it made them sound quite nearly good sr80's! i recommend them you wholeheartedly ! if you google " listening station , " place purchase any grado product	1

korg makes good stuff all way around , this tuner no exception . it affordable easy use . i second those who suggest checking batteries regularly ; tuner become iffy if they wear down . however , this not uncommon battery-operated tuning devices . all all , this great deal it'll help you keep your instrument ready-to-play condition	1

bought father day gift my husband , who interested learning play . very moderate price , it seems very good value money	1
i saw this guitar sale ordered it whim , thinking if it no good i could use it canoe paddle or give kits play . i played bass recreationally 17 years , occasionally strummed guitar here there . i currently own classical guitar i've 10 years , sold my steel-string guitars several years ago . i wanted this replace steel stringed ones , take camping , when i didn't want take fairly nice classical guitar risk its damage . when i opened box , i astounded find guitar very fine black finish , action almost perfect , actually nearly tune . it looks great sounds very good . sealed tuners very smooth kept guitar tune thusfar . only flaws i could see small bit glue where fretboard met top , just soundhole , very slight overlap some binding glue onto body , maybe 0.2 mm 1mm , only noticable when looking it . soundwise , it sounds very good , especially considering cost . it sounds especially good pick . treble side guitar bright clear . bass side it little thin , low ' ' fairly dull when fingerpicking . i am hoping changing stock strings might help it little . it passable , just not great . frets very good , smooth . ends nicely rounded . i expected need polish frets , but this point leave them as-is . sum it up , i think this guitar complete steal price if you beginner looking start , or if you want spare guitar keep lakehouse or take camping . it plays very good looks even better . like i said , i intended take this one camping , but it almost too nice	1
first let me just say i'm big fan danelectro . i own six their effects pedals addition this amp . they make excellent products what they charge i've impressed almost everything i've bought them . headphone amp - first off you might well throw out headphones it comes , they're crap . but that expected i guess . aside , everything else performs very well . it definitely loud enough , distortion good , however it pretty fuzzy gets noisy higher volumes . echo this thing , ( which main reason i decided get this instead rockman ) awesome . it sounds exactly like my classic slap echo pedal . it very clear stays consistent distortion or off higher volumes . i like line out option but i haven't tried it yet . it cool idea though . it smaller than i thought it going which pleasant surprise . it size pack cigarettes , maybe little bigger . definately small enough keep your pocket . it also very lightweight . my only real complaint retarded sea foam green color , cheesy fake chrome but who cares , no one ever sees it anyway . overall i'd definately reccomend this amp anyone looking mini headphone amp (...) . dean headphone amp looks like it could decent but it doesnt come echo it hard find .	1

i know lot guitarists aren't near picky picks i am . so why should you ? after all , there no pick make you play better they all generally same . wrong . i thought too first . i figured it just piece plastic , how hard it pick one ? i started out fender pick because they looked pretty conventional they moderately priced . i blindly went through ten these due them all breaking . if you knew me well you'd know i thrash my guitar ... lot ... even thickest picks would wear down me within week , most them too slick stay my sweaty hand during these crash burn guitar playing moments . i came realize i needed heavy duty pick good grip would retain it shape least couple weeks . first i thought metal answer . i mean , it hard rock most them come good grip them . but after playing them i discovered sound not my liking . it sounded too buzzy metal . that time i discovered tortex picks . i amazed . they best grip i ever felt kept their shape weeks ! i instantly bought every size i could get all way thinnest read bulky blue one . months later i'm keeping stock these picks my house . solos i prefer green one because it got just right resistance fast picking but not too much so it slows you down . strumming i use orange . it just perfect ... i cannot express you how much you need try this pick . your wasting your money anything other than dunlop . get tortex see what i mean	1
i really enjoy playing this harp whenever i get chance because it produces very good sound without blow or suck lot air . i found it very easy bend notes , fact this first harp which i able bend notes . roundedout edges also very nice hands it makes it easier hold . it made plastic not wood but hasn't caused problem so far . so i would reccomend hohner golden melody any key anyone . although i would choose one key , if you're begginer because it would easier learn i think	1

there no such thing " best string " . experimenting over years , i've found , while i " old standbys " first thing i try , often there string just right particular guitar it varies guitar guitar . coated strings become all rage over last few years . they're expensive , but they last lot longer , especially if you kind body chemistry causes them corrode quickly . also , they minimize amount finger noise you get if you slide strings . elixir polywebs first coated string . coating much heavier than other strings . this produces much less bright , more muted sound . i old koa guitar so bright i can't stand it standard strings . elixir polywebs tone it down point where it perfect . if you're looking darker sound , then elixir polywebs definitely worth shot . if you want coated string but prefer brighter sound uncoated strings , then you definitely don't want polywebs . 4 stars applies if you want this particular type sound . if you don't want this sound , you could end up awarding them 1 star	1

these standard strings i've using since 2000 . after going through only 4 pairs since then , i doubt i'll changing brands . especially this price . just look . just any store they're up 3 times expensive . don't let price fool you . sure , there some strings around 20 bucks , but doesn't mean they're better . ernie ball one ( if not , ) top brands when it comes musical instruments accessories . sound quality tone these suckers phenominal . you bend , whammy , slap pluck these things hard you , they won't break . fact , i've same set strings since october 2003 they're still working like day i put them . there isn't whole lot say strings . i mean , they're what you need play guitar that it . these work well , therefore , they're good . nab few extra sets these while they're so cheap	1
i agree previous reviewer . i'm giving this item five stars because it exactly what we hoped it would : reasonably-priced way get students started zills . there no convenient local source zills so we stock up then sell students , price/value these zills makes possible .	1
