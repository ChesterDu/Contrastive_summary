foil bit misleading , because if you shaving parts your body many curves ( under zipper ) timmer catch you it hurts , lot . foil only used straight surfaces . two trimmer blases rest 200degree angle . if you many curves mow foil without hitting trimmer .... well , prepared spend night or two sofa	1
reading magnifiers i ordered 09/29/04 finally arrived 10/19/04 after call seller . ( original order shipped amazon.com so it reshipped me . ) it only took 5 minutes or so assemble one reading magnifiers , it possible adjust it just any position clever arm . weighted base keep it falling over . unfortunately , thin plastic lense such poor quality it very difficult receive any benefit device . if user turned adjustment knob too far , it nut holds it together would fall off . nut small must inserted into outside adjustment knob assemble device . knob actually turns nut onto screw . presumably device someone low vision . if small nut falls floor , i'm not sure someone low vision would able find it . my advice save your money buy quality device nice glass lens .... if possible , try device out before buying .	1
i bought this ioniczone themselves . it not work . i kept it entire month , filter never dirty all . also , this unit extremely small , pic rather misleadingi however able return unit office nv , make 2 phone calls person very polite . i went buy one ionicpro , what difference it , filters requires cleaning every 10 days or so it really dirty .	-1

razor blades expensive enough it , trend " more better " reached almost ludicrous points industry . what ? five blades , you say ? why , it must better than four ! meh . i fine stubble which grows varying angles across my neck . good news , while other razors always unable remove all my stubble first try , this blade , fact , take care problem . addition this , it aggravated skin quite bit ( this might much vibrating action five blades ) . precious soothing-aloe strip little no effect my skin ( particularly neck area ) . if you sensitive skin all , this might not razor you . contrary experience others , however , extra " trimming " blade worked well me when getting spots edge my mouth , under my nose , when shaping my vast hedge-like sideburns . however , five blades other side dulled remarkably fast . considering my rather fine hairs , i'm used exchanging blades once every week or so . now i'm exchanging them twice week . seeing how this product already so much more expensive than competitors ' products , seeing how it designed work exclusively fusion razor ( vice versa ) , seeing how its lavish wealth cutting action clawed my skin , i find it hard recommend	1
i would give this product negative 50 stars if i could . i paid beaucoup several very plain bras ( no lace or other embelishments ) didn't wear or wash bras until i received brababy . i assumed brababy would protect my bras wash , that what product claims . imagine my suprise when i pulled my bras out washer ( out their respective " bra demolition cages " ) find them ruined . i'm talking not wearable . straps both brand new , never worn , previously mint condition bras hanging out all over place looked like they chewed animal . both bras dents molded cups . then i saw one bras two noticeable rips cup ! i nearly flipped out ! i think my bras would've better " washed " i thrown them into center pack rabid fighting mad dogs . only positive thing report amazon refunded my money . back hand washing my bras back mall i go replace ripped bra . perhaps other it dented cups suitable halloween ?	-1
ok folks , this relatively low quality starter kit really decent company . art shaving products general really nice , albeit tad pricey . this small kit gives you nice sample entire line shaving products work nicely together . full sized items cost you $75 - $100 total . included brush " toss away " quality brush . this not just my opinion , but quote manager art shaving store . my advice get some samples department store , then purchase art shaving shave cream ( wow ! great product ) here amazon , plus either tweezerman badger brush $15 or best badger brush crabtree evelyn $35 .	1
two main problems this " cordless massager " . first it doesn't hold charge very long . you may get hour use full charge , shows diminishing power it goes . add it general lack any real massaging capability you one very poor piece equipment . if you're looking something rumble slight bit , this you . otherwise , save your money	-1

i like how quickly rollers heat - vast improvement over waiting least half hour . however , like other reviewer said - i absolutely hate clips . they all one size , so they too large smallest rollers . i also don't like them because they don't keep roller still like " u " shaped clips , they leave dent impression my hair . i don't recommend them primarily because clip system	1
my rollers constantly popping out clip holders this set , regardless me using more or less hair . maybe there magical perfect portion hair roller ratio . if so it impossible find . i dunno , but i know i would not recommend these . also even when i get these stay my hair , my hair doesn't curl nearly much it usually hot rollers . overall buy something else	-1

when i ordered this item , i assumed flosser attachment would some sort gadget which you would add new dental floss each use . actually , each flosser plastic prong pre-strung floss it , used once discarded . let me see : million conscientious users floss daily you 365,000,000 plastic doodads added world landfills every year . i already compromise my principles convenience more than i'd like admit . this totally over top . when i've used up my supply flossers , out this thing goes . it goes into landfill , sure . so don't anyone else make my mistake	-1

these hair topia pills nothing but garbage ! pure nonsense ! trust me , i know this because i used buy them . i first bought these pills last year june 2005 after hair formula 37 unsuccessful promise producing longer stronger hair four months usage . well , these pills not expensive previous brand mentioned , promised also change dry brittle hair into long healthy , it absolute nothing . i said myself , like hair formula 37 , maybe i just need give this more time , so i bought 2-month supply gave it 3 months all there no difference all . this product might just work others , which it , but it certainly didn't work me . i must admit i brought this myself , my mother warned me not buy these ridiculously expensive pill since they nothing hair grows naturally anyway , if you really want get hair pills then just buy them whole lot cheaper regular stores like giant or even hair vitamins damn dollar store ! thus , i am here warn others not waste their precious money . if you going , please don't it this site-you buy this product little cheaper hairboutique.com .	-1

i disappointed getting this product because i've read previous reviews majority written positive feedback this hair iron . i actually prefer cheaper conair ceremanic irons w/o wet on/off feature over this one . it doesn't clamp down well my hair ( i've got thick frizzy hair ) . results me aren't great , it straightens my hair little but it still frizzy . it lightweight which nice . i don't care wet hair option because it takes me twice long straighten my hair . i definitely prefer other models over this one .	1
i this model , or least it looked same , few years it worked exceptionally well . it finally broke down recently i thought i lucky enough find it again , but they must changed product significantly because it not work very well all . actually , it virtually useless it only partially gets job , which , course like not it all	-1

this review oral-b flexisoft replacement heads . coupled braun electric toothbrushes , this one most effective aids oral hygiene ever developed . my introduction oral-b goes back over 27 years usaf basic training briefing ; dental technician held up oral-b toothbrush medium bristles said " this toothbrush you need if you want keep your teeth " or some such statement like . well , i haven't lost one yet . motorized mechanicals toothbrush most work while you guide oscillating round head around over your pearly whites . while heads undeniably pricey when looked just dollars cents , there value fact total package actually makes rather mundane chore little more fun while actually living up claim it better job your teeth than manual brushing . since i've always believed entire surface area toothbrush head meant covered toothpaste size head these smaller than average brush , i know i'm using less toothpaste same job . while this no big deal , long term economic benefit plaque under control , healthy gums bright smile full natural teeth . it kind hard deny it works since my dentist confirmed positive results upon direct examination . just careful what model these brush heads you selecting watch pricing . oral-b uses kind color code bristles , ones colored indicator bristles line shaft flexisoft model seems equate medium hardness . enjoy life	1

this price , we got pedometers whole family . my 9 year old son worn his every day since . it interesting see how many steps you take day . we not set pace length recommended , but other than , it ready use immediately - just clip it onto your waistband . shows steps , miles calories burned . my only complaint front cover little hard flip open	1
i really liked this product , so smooth , noiseless . very easy use also less efforts required remove hair ...... i go again it .....	1
i surprised open this pedometer page after sometime see all negative reviews it receives . i using this specific model more than 3 months now i am really satisfied it . it really accurate ( lt ; 1% declination , i performed more than four tests more than 400 steps during different times its life i seen couple cheap pedometers performing much worse ) , clips firmly belt or pants , displays time conveniently nice backlight , even radio which works , although most people said , not really its best feature . truth i am not using radio all , mostly because i believe batteries last longer it save me extra trips walmart . but i tested it it works , although nothing impressive there . course , money , i think you cannot go wrong this pedometer . one funny comment , although most people complain it cannot open very easily , after sometime it open more easily you think . actually it couple times where putting bag my shoulders or waist pouch applying some pressure it mistake , open it wide , so it not count any steps . but it not open itself anyway , needs external force this happen , so it not happen often . all all , i am sure plastic construction less than rigorous production testing result many pieces not function properly result bad reviews . maybe i lucky , maybe not , but this one best most reliable devices i carry use every day . great incentive walking exercising more	1

i looking cheap trimmer my beard , which i usually keep pretty short . i bought this without seeing it store . i think i seen it good reviews here , it under thirty bucks , which i figured good limit something only going last so long . i didn't need anything fancy . i got exactly what i looking , but i'm surprised how well it works . there aren't any parts seem like they'll fall apart , it got great feel hand . i like action it lot . my first trim immediately better much quicker then previous trimmer i ( which died me ) . i think this great deal someone who needs occasional shave beard . i really like it . nothing fancy but it gets job very well . i can't think how it would better	1
my local kroger selling this item $3.88 per bottle ( if you use your reward card - which free anyone who wants it ) - math . amazon price rip off .	-1
attachement little delicate flimsy . fitting might issue once while but overall i am satisfied product	1
got these christmas gift . they work great . i agree other reviews , these not slippers you want walk . i recommend wearing socks these because i find it tends too warm my bare feet . drawstrings nice because it really keeps heat inside slipper	1
i think it cute . it pulls little when taking gems out your hair , but my daughter loves it	1
my daughter uses this set regularly home work . she very pleased . this high quality item . thank you	1

this aquis hair turban first microfiber towels i've tried . i'm very impressed ! this 19 39 inch towel way way way more than enough toweling off after shower . plus it dries out very quickly hanging it over towel bar . true , it not towel you really wrap yourself up , but it sure save space washer dryer ! i definitely buying more aquis towels	1
i like these go . no trasnporting home dirty food filled bibs . you use these bibs toss away . they also neat little pocket catches food bits drop so resturant floor isnt full droppings end meal ! i think all resturants should these give them their patrons	1
this brush performs well . however , use it 3 weeks take look inside--it filled bacteria grime . this stuff very difficult remove , especially inside part holds brush . this not good because same bacteria comes out your mouth reinfect your mouth every time you brush . it tends stay wet inside brush which makes great place this stuff thrive . only toothpaste work this overpriced crest toothpaste . i only use colgate total ( triclosan ) so i never bothered adding cartridge after first few . don't fooled -- using this brush not replace need flossing . save some money get normal sonicare brush without toothpaste	1
good perfume casual wear . i personally found prior range ferrari perfumes better . perfume seems give little too bold fragrance when you just spray it ... however it subsidies pretty soon . not buy this perfume if you looking something spray friday or saturday night	1
great clipper . not stop working after few uses most other clippers	1
gives hair shine without greasy or slimey . also mixed all other bumble bumble products . but careful , use too much , you weigh your hair down	1

i found this showerhead very easy install exactly advertised . however , curved handle makes it hard hold there no way adjust tilt when showerhead ' hook ' . i would also liked seen temp-off switch ( handy shaving etc ) , but this pretty cheap shower head , so i can't ask much . good value	1
i like this razor lot . it cuts pretty well , nice tight way i like it . fact it water proof means you shave shower get even closer shave . it also makes cleaning cinch . also , battery life this baby awesome . although i am asian i don't full beard content . i shave every morning ever since i got it 2.5 years ago , i'm still same set lithium batteries .	1

i've owner several remington express sets my lifetime . all them worked wonderfully . my issue these rollers isn't their quality - they work excellently , heat up quickly very compact store . only problem instead pins , they come clippy-type holders keep them your hair . i suppose clips would work okay if you fine , short medium length hair . i shoulder length hair that not very thick , clip holders would not keep rollers my hair . i could only put very small section hair around roller if i any hope it staying put my head . most time clips would pop off roller would fall out if i so much turned my head . remington set compact express rollers called " all " , which almost identical function , only they come pins instead clips . if you're looking something quality , compact easy use stay your hair until you're ready take them out , i'd recommend set instead this one	-1

i pack my lunch take work every day several lunc containers i use , including fit fresh product . i've used this item twice probably never use it again . ice gel ring very small melts almost immediately . food cold compartment not stay cold ( or even cool ) soup container not really insulated all , so gets cold . it nice concept but just doesn't work . if you equipment reheat your soup don't pack anything bottom actually needs stay cool/cold , then this okay way transport your lunch . just don't expect steaming bowl soup crisp salad when it time eat	1

i exclusive norelco shaver user past 7 years . my first 6756x advantage which i still use occasionally , followed few years later norelco 8894xl spectra . both these shaver still work well . reason i purchased new 7775x because after 7 years use my 6756x only hold charge few shaves , otherwise works perfectly . although i my new 7775x shaver short time , it seems provide close shave my old unit . pros : 7775x more secure changing base than old unit ( deeper ) . message display provides good status shaver include battery charge which old unit not indicate until it near depleted . unit still maintains shaving cream/gel dispenser . this especially useful it you travel frequently like i . no more worries my shaving cream confiscated . cons : if you primarily use shaver dry then rinse indicator useful . my purchasing in/out shower shavers ability always use it wet some type cream or gel . i find closeness shave equal any bladed razor i ever used , without nicks cuts . i would not recommend suspending shaver supplied plastic hanger strap which not near secure my old unit . it looks like it could easily disconnected allowing unit fall possibly break . overall , i am very satisfied my new 7775x . i expect it provide same long life service close shave my old unit . i would recommend you keep you unit clean charged required most importantly change shaver heads once year , recommended . doing so should provide same long live close shave i enjoyed over years . happy shaving !	1

i love 4 blades . it really very close shave , but hardly feels like you're shaving . it just glides over your legs ( knees ) , first time i used it i check make sure it working , i'm so used feeling scraping or resistance when i shave my legs . it doesn't cut my legs or armpits no matter what kind rush i'm , shaves faster because i never need go over spots i already shaved . blades also seem last longer without changed , so it worth money . two thumbs up product actually lives up advertising . also , packaging crazy thick plastic encases everything now , but there serated edge surrounding razor makes it easy open ! you don't need scissors or your cleaving knife , just couple fingers open it up :	1
