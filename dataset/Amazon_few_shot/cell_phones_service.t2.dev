t-mobile worst customer services . sometimes , it company mistake they still blame it customer . since i started my plan , i problem reciving my bill time . so , company start charging me $5 late fee four consecutive months . also , when i tried adding additional features such their text-message-bundle , change account not take effect till two days later , i charged 10 cents each message i used these two days , it costed me additional $4 . every time i tried complaining their customer services , they just wouldn't listen . i am starting get feeling they just trying maximize their profit . more than once , if i stay long-enough line , they put me mute so they don't listen my complaining . i feeling i am treated like dirt not like customer . i worst customer-services experience t-mobile . also , reception not best country . i friends who using same phone one i but different network , they getting services places where i don't it , they pay same amount money	-1
this deal too good true . course i wasn't expecting any name brand stuff here , but least i expected them all work . i don't know if i got bad earbud or what , but it adds static noise therefore cannot used . case i didn't need , but it fit well looks decently constructed . power adapter seems work fine . so basically i spent $9.99 am only using power adapter . i guess that good enough deal . i think i'll go spend some extra money get brand name earbud/headset though	1

i bought this because my current battery would die after 5 15 minutes talk time full charge ( after sitting closet year ) . i thrilled get battery would make my mobile phone truly mobile again . i opened it up , put it my phone , tried close battery cover it would not close . not even close . if i forced it really hard i could get it just close over latch , but it actually bending plastic phone latch would probably danger popping off any momen t.t he battery 50% thicker than standard battery motorola v60 . might great extra battery life , but bad if you can't get get battery cover your phone . i give it two stars because battery may work fine all i know , but it won't fit v60	1

i've my headset month now . noted reviewer , this headset not come any buttons or switches - only thing cord shirt clip . 6 different ear gels included accomodate different ears , which nice ( though i've only ever used one ) . headset very easy slip into my ear ( only takes 1 second ) comfortable up 2 hours wear ( which point my ear starts get little sore ) . my boyfriend reported similar experience other headsets use ear gels . if you regularly stay phone longer than 2 hours , it something keep mind . however , it suits my needs just fine , low price , i think it really great buy	1
these very good not expensive . you buy these staples they charge $5 more . i agree public exchange needed . if anyone knows one , you please post information here . we'll all appreciate it ! anybody want trade extras	1
i've using this phone net10 service since march , say i am very happy it . coverage areas great . i don't use cell phone very often , so this most economical way me go . although phone doesn't all bells whistles like other phones .... it gets job	1

i recently got 8525 i loved it first mainly because multi functions it could . however eventually i found out phone part this pda not great my previous camera phone . my friends complain they hear lot outside noise while talking . phone ear-volume quite low i constantly put it max it if i am noisy places . pros : software : windows applications - word , excel , media player . plus : ability create office documents play games hardware : micro sd slot - sandisk card cost me 20 bucks . wireless internet : you could connect this device any wireless unsecure network get internet . i dont data plan cingular but i connect internet home through my wifi home network . if iam coffee shop i could connect their secure network get internet free . cons : * bit bulky carry around . * camera not expected . view finder sloppy cannot capture images low light . * battery needs charged every second day ( depends usage ) but even light use i charge it every other day . best suitable : * internet savvy people who move . * email messaging . * pocket pc . * listen music ( need purchase micro-sd card)accessories : boxwave leather case ($30)leather case boxwave fits pretty good protects device . only problem after you put this case , phone volume needs set max , even after you wont able hear other person so well . but boxwaver case could opened half way folded over . bluetooththis device works very well blue tooth . bottom line : if you ok minor inconveniences while using phone this you .	1

k790a currently best " cybershot " camera phone sony ericsson lineup ( but more way ) also hands-down best camera phone u.s. today . it too bad se doesn't sell their 5mp 6mp camera phones stateside . but k790a very capable digital camera . sure , it only 3mp , but like many professionals tell you , pixel count only one thing . this 3mp camera-in-a-phone takes better-looking pictures than 5mp 6mp cameras vivitar , aptech ( sp ? ) , samsung other offbrand companies . my main phone sanyo m1 2mp i thought it pretty good camera phone , but when i got k790a use my prepaid sim card , i simply blown away quality . ( course , i bought phone exactly because i heard great things its picture quality , but results still far exceeded my high expectations . ) camera very easy use . i don't care mms features because my prepaid service ( speak out wireless ) doesn't support them . i just download them my pc using usb card reader . i wish there optical zoom ( more more camera phones japan , including models casio , now optical zoom ) but truth course if you need serious picture-taking you still use real digital camera . but this comes real close replacing your workhorse digicam . i'll use this year upgrade se next gen next year , hopefully then they'll released optical zoom-equipped phones . summary , this great camera . oh , phone functions fine , too . reception pretty good t-mobile + cingular networks ( used speak out wireless ) . voice clear loud . really good . 5 stars	1
this case what it supposed ... it protects your palm treo phone . it very nice looking durable . only negative comment i make case occasionally memory card gets ejected when taking phone out case due snug fit . why i gave it 4/5 . amazon best price case it well worth price	1
i bought my v360 ebay it sold unlocked/unbranded it quad-band variety . here my take : pros :-d urability ; this thing built clumsy mind ( like me ) . i must dropped this thing dozen times there barely scratch . -mp3 player ; i agree onboard 5mb memory joke , but cost transhflash memory coming down ( i bought my 512mb chip ebay $7.99 ) then upgrading easy affordable . said , mp3 player feature you actually use , sound quality good . i've no problem playing my itunes music ( long they're mp3 format no greater 192kbps quality then it play fine . ) ** media player defaults wma itunes defaults m4a formats - you need convert them mp3 or change default either program rip mp3 format ( you change default mp3 settings menu)-programmable " smart keys " ; i read where one user complained camera button not side , it camera icon button front keypad . he must not known you reprogram all smart buttons " personalize " menu . not only , but you rearrange menu buttons program most buttons face frequently used apps . it handy little feature . -built bluetooth edge technology . you may not use these features out-of-the box , but they're time when these technologies more commonplace . i use my bluetooth my wireless headset syncing adding files ( mp3 , pics , etc ) my phone my laptop . -quad-band world phone capable . this phone works 850 , 900 , 1800 , 1900 gsm networks ( although not personally tested ) . however , i traveling micronesia uk within year i'll know certain then . cons:-there slight delay when you answer call - i usually say " hello " 2-3 times or wait few seconds before i begin speak . i don't know if this carrier problem or phone . ( i use cingular prepaid ) . -the light stays while charging ( even when phone powered off ) . it annoying . -the onboard memory joke . you really need upgrade memory if you want anything extra phone . -it monochrome outer display ( full color inside ) . this doesn't bother me all , but it not flashy razr or other phones . overall : this great , durable little phone handy features i think people actually use . i've read where people complain picture quality - but that what digital camera . if you want good quality cell phone that well designed , user friendly , doesn't look like tricked-out teenager phone , then this phone you .	1

i gave this four stars because `jacket ' adds significant bulk weight sansa product . what once slim , sleek product now rather large , rubberized item . plus side , this jacket definitely protects mp3 ; it very solid , covers item completely securely . they included belt clip , screen cover very hard not easily scratched . buttons around wheel far easier press now . i wish there other color choices , but over all i'm very pleased product . before it covered i reluctant put my purse or pocket fear breakage scratches screen , but now i feel very safe carrying sansa taking it anywhere i go . highly recommended product	1
after reading reviews here this case , i thought i'd take plunge try it . cases i'd seen stores fairly cheesey , although they cheaper . this wonderful case . materials first-rate fit perfect . i highly recommend this case	1
promptly received two replacement batteries our phones , price one original vendor . they work great ! they hold charge , normal use , two-three days , our original ones when we first purchased them . would buy again , if needed	1
