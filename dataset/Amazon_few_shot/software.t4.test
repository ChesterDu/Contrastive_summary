reading cover i thought it would great product . it indeed some good items but overall this something one live without . games - bowling game actually teaser version . you play only two lanes . others cost you extra . two other games not exciting . themes screen savers mediocre . i liked analog convertor but not too much . if you get input any audio device , this program convert it into digital format . alas it doesn't convert mp3 format . also you need keep computer completely free other load while recording otherwise songs recorded slow or fast , but not normal speed . dancers provide some entertainment young kids two minutes but soon they find out these dancers canned actions . i liked ben though especially when he gets tired dancing . bottom line - i don't think you would regret buying this 17 dollars but novelty wear off within week .	-1
i bought this product after reading other on-line reviews saying how easy it use . i am someone who works computers daily this anything but easy ! it hard understand getting someone their help desk assist joke ! i wouldn't recommend this product anyone unless you're professional architect/ computer genius	-1

im computer literate regularly use number varying programs visio logic audio ms office . after picking up illustrator however , im frustrated lack intuition steep learning curve software offers . ive told world revolves around 2 types people : those who " get " vector graphic programs , those who errrr ... dont . unfortunately , after 10 hours use much manual reading , i fall into later category . i dont plan give up however plan enroll course . this decision supported friends proficient its use - but who difficulty demonstrating complex concepts me . ( indeed , defining direction drawn curve intuitive metaphsyics or nuclear science ! )so my advice this : extremely carefull if youve never used illustrator before . it may breeze those well versed its use , but absoloute beginner its extremely difficult program grasp you may dissapointed find this out after youve forked out your hard earned dollars it .	-1

i tried unsuccessfully several times install it . i contact their alleged support . they sent me what they deemed " fix " . fix awful . it caused my computer crash print shop would never work . broderbund used good company but i've nothing but problems their software late . they need rethink their products , their support , their company focus . they lousy this poin t.t hey obviously don't give dang quality , support , or their customers	-1

i'm midst auditioning lcd panels local isf certified guy wants $350 per panel calibrate them . i like tv everything , but there just no way i am going spend $350 tv i might possibly keep . still , store settings any two panels two problems . first , they amped up beyond compare tv vendors compete " who brightest " lit showroom floor . sitting my living room , they far far too bright watch . second , they display colors totally differently . it just hard compare 2 sets calibrated so differently . now tvs we looking cost pretty penny , it seemed couple hundred dollars inform decision good idea , just like hundred dollars hdmi splitter seemed like good idea . splitter good idea , spyder tv colormeter not so much . i calibrated 2 panels this product . two things true calibrations . first , they not look all same . sony panel red shifted flesh tones while sharp looks cold sterile . second , they look way way worse than before calibration . after 20 minutes watching casino royale , it time revert back toned down version factory defaults each . first i thought i not followed instructions right . maybe it not dark enough . maybe sensor not positioned right . process several times , i state categorically while colorvision spyder tv may not deliver good results , it consistent its delivery bad results . i simply cannot recommend this product	-1
game called fritz chesster . fritz boy . chester rat . girl you see picture , her name bianca . she never actually plays . she just says things like " well , brave knight ! " asks stupid questions . one point poor bianca points out queen strongest piece , fritz makes comment his mother chewing out his father . tone context extremely anti-woman , my opinion . he also counters saying boys smarter . it seems like makers this game really threatened fact you call most powerful piece " she " . take queen down notch , they refer group or queens harem . demonstrate how this powerful piece moves they queen run around picking flowers fast she . male voice says , " off you go , " tone which one only assume meant accompany little pat her behind .	-1

i bought this based amazon reviews . i am extremely new this but software pretty good . teacher somewhat annoying reviewer said , he sings over his playing way too much . i wish there way turn him way down guitar up . it touts over 160 lessons , but somewhat misleading . i don't doubt it over 160 pages , but i covered 23 " lessons " hour . i like fact first few lessons he teaches you very easy versions chords so you don't feel hung up doing full chords when your fingers don't want move strange new positions they aren't used . i am using this well fender dvd acoustic keith wyatt . dvd little more challenging me , but keith wyatt much better than guy emedia software ( he doesn't feel need sing !!! ) . overall , i would recommend this software	1
