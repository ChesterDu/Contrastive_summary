this game heavily developed based actual movie . if you haven't seen movie , and/or your kid too young understand plot , then they might not get game . most adventures based story plot . lot adventures bit dumb , like mcqueen bumping alphabet tires into truck , mcqueen tipping over tractors based counting smoke rings , mcqueen herding tractors back into pen , mcqueen driving down long road picking up shapes , mcqueen driving down road looking mack based memory , mcqueen dodging firetruck water blast , etc . only adventure i liked forklift picking up tire numbers ( odd vs . even ) installing them race car . don't buy this game unless your kid obsessed cars	-1

this game put together nice concept , ctu agent help jack bauer stop terrorist attack . also , i liked fact there mole someone right next you could destroy whole game . however , interactive games such used get more clues not made well . though you try what it tells you , it doesn't seem work . since these interactive parts so simple , yet not made way one control what going , you waste your time trying them you never get end . i three college students two adults try it adn no one could seem get it work correctly . so , if some bugs worked out , this game could much bigger success	-1

one my daughters received this gift i couldn't wait play it her . there four categories questions : breed , riding , horse care , anatomy . players move across board , they choose question any category . some reviewers said , some questions extremely easy . however - some very challenging . i say this someone who riding 35 yrs who owned horses . example , one question " mares come into season : ( a/ 21 days during spring summer , b/21 days during fall winter , c/41 days during summer fall ) ( correct answer " " ) . easier question : true/false : you must always wear helmet chin strap when you jumping horse ( true ) . there 200 questions all ; i seriously doubt anyone would find it entirely too easy or entirely too hard - there good mix difficulty levels	1

carcassonne excellent game not only simple fun play , but chock full strategy planning . game great family friends , simple enough teach kids . it takes hour play , so it good after dinner game , or whenever you don't multiple hours play . said , game fun diverse enough play several games back back when you several hours hand . simple game appears , there lot strategy get involved placement your meeples . you spend game trying look like you're working your own territory , hoping other players don't notice you trying rob them their end-game points . there bit luck comes into play , it wreck your genius strategy , but that fun game . i highly recommend this game any board gamer , anyone thinking playing board games , or any gamer trying recruit friends family into joys non-electronic games	1

i currently own three these lightsabers master replicas : anakin skywalker ( blue ) blade , darth vader ( red ) blade , mace windu ( purple ) blade . more information anakin model or vader model , please check my comparisons those products darth vader fx lightsaber reviews . i loved these replicas so much one just couldn't enough ..... but because they cost average $70.00 $120.00 each , i budget myself purchase them individually over three month span . first good points : first thing i noticed saber proper weight make it feel like real thing well-detailed silver gold highlights . i loved fact it doesn't huge , bulbous on/off switch right middle hilt you others . switch would actually difficult find if i didn't yellow decal pasted it saying on/off . you must continue careful it , however , because you still accidentally turn it off while using it ( very annoying ) . now bad : bad things mace windu model requires 6 aa batteries ( others only take 3 ) . saber ignites cool snap-hiss but all sound effects identical blue anakin model ( least vader model different sound effects than others ) . i also noticed blue anakin sabers ' sounds much crisper/clearer than mace windu purple blade . brings me good point : purple blade itself not distinctive others . even low light it looks more white than purple . you hold blue blade right next purple blade really see noticable difference . could each them vary ? it possible ..... but my own saber purple color little disappointing : bright ? yes . purple ? sorta . all all , if i known all this before i made purchase i'm not sure if i would bought it ( maybe green luke skywalker model instead ) . maybe this why mace windu model cheaper than all rest ? who knows . i give this one 4 out 5 stars	-1

i really liked this item but thought i'd point out few things might make this iffy . it took me two hours assemble but because i my helpers me . i pretty much figured out instructions this item two exceptions : how double hinges went because drawing wasn't clear , fact several instances , " " screws instructions assigned not long enough . this problem silver overhead bar -- i ended up using some my own longer screws because top part wobbly using longest screws given kitchen . i liked fact this not pink still lots options playing despite it small size ; it great our local library where space premium . one other thing i noted one towel bars below overhang island ; kind weird , non-accessible place so it must just looks . plexi-glass oven door cracked broken right out box so it exchanged second one , too . if some kids breaks it throwing or hitting it right object , plexiglass sharp . if you're really concerned , you could probably remove glass right away	-1

this car pictured could base or first version defintely not worth 299.00 these going 100.00 less web . if you havent noticed differences packaging it wouldnt suprise me . lots people dont notice . heres differences below ... these 5 cars there two versions each driver(5 different drivers ) made . first versions or base version second versions or " added features " version . first versions no " added features " stickers you cannot race any two ( or more ) cars 5 different drivers ' cars same time ! dale sr. dale jr. , jeff gordon , jimmie johnson tony stewart cars first versions ( no added features ) cannot race together ! transmitter frequencys cannot changed . speed steering straight function . ( no varilable anything ) they either turn right full turn or left full turn or it goes straight . speed either it goes full or it doesnt . same reverse gear . again , each 5 different drivers ' cars made two different versions same car one more features than other . updated or " added features " versions " added features " stickers . those " added features " ... digital proportional steering ( variable steering ) , which means you turn transmitter wheel slightly car turns little . turn transmitter wheel alot car turns alot . variable speed control this means you pull back trigger little car moves little , pull back trigger all way car takes off ! this also works reverse gears well now if this isnt cool enough ... each " added features " car different frequencies different drivers ' car . transmitters cars different well .

this game truly fun ! it sort " i-spy " type game competitive twist . three cards turned everyone must find corresponding images board , fast . game board made up several inter-locking pieces , which re-shuffled make it hard anyone memorize game board . game last 30 seconds , or go one forever if everyone likes it . younger kids may take longer than older ones find images , but even young ones great time . my children 5 7 both enjoy game tremendously	1
my son 2 1/2 loves this toy . he it quite awhile , still laughs until he silly everytime balls start flying everywhere . only downfall toy ball ramp tends come off alot , my son can't get it back himself . also , it only comes 5 balls , so i ordered more [ ... ] . 5 balls bag $[ ... ]	1
i like idea back pack matches leap pad . only thing i think missing more slots small game cartridges . very durable easy carry	1
i own these toys , i lot fun them . i like sneak around house listen conversations , look around binocs , use light beam sensor stay alert if my sister enters my base . binocs pretty good you adjust them so whatever your looking won't blury . light binocs turned inside binocs or they pop out more distance . batteries last fairly long , don't run out too fas t.t he spy listener thing glasses works well , you even hear people wisper . if you twist end spy listener thing while it clicked back module it pop out cool gesture into what it looks like picture provided amazon time . setback it it us very small , expensive batteries . i left mine it lost all battery power i haven't chance ask my dad get some new ones yet . overall it good device . spy light beam sensor sends out invisible beam if broken sounds alarm . you pull front out or push it sensitivity or range you want . device not work well if layed ground . therefore , you should put it something foot or two above ground . range it not very far because mine it only went 2-3 feet but maybe thats because i use it lot . i give this set 5 stars fun because i lot fun playing spy my friends . i give it 3 stars eductional value because you use your imagination . i give it 4 stars durability because all these taken big falls while playing them when i spy halloween . i give it 4 stars overall because thats what it averages out	-1

manufacturer amazon recommend this up age 7 . my opinion this cute game younger crowd , 2-5 . my step-son 6 years old kindergarten . he knows most answers games so it not very challenging he doesn't seem learning anything it . apple picking game fun but not enough entertain him long . i'm thinking this game abandoned quickly but adored his younger sister	-1

i excited try these out , what i'd heard they best . i read other reviews saying installation difficult , however our only problem because our cupboards little silicon bumper pad corner , foam sticky installation guide wasn't thick enought hit cupboard ... we just doubled two them up it fine . function these locks ... they awesome ! traditional cabinet locks allow you open them finger width order push down plastic piece open them all way ... tot lok you can't open cupboard even little bit , which eliminates any finger smashing your little one . admittedly , it hard habit get into , using key every time ... however i soon got hang remembering grab it , i also make great use " permanent unlock " bar , which you flip keep cabinet unlocked if you like . this way , if i am cleaning up need throw paper towels , old toast , leftovers , etc into garbage under sink , i just keep cupboard unlocked while i'm doing my thing . these loks completely invisible outside , not bad looking inside . hardest part introducing our new cherry cabinets drill bit ! i would buy these again again recommend them all parents	1

overall i'm very happy purchase this rc car . optional nicad battery , this car really moves . ( i highly recommend battery pack , even over nickel metal hydride aa batteries because car really 30% faster advertised . battery pack really 8aa batteries , but car only takes 6aa when you don't use pack ) . only draw back transmitter little weak , so it range somewhat limited . 50 feet away or so , you'll lose function . however , car very quick so far very rugged well . i've jumped flipped it many times it still drives great . only $30 both car battery pack , i'd buy it again ... fact i . i decided i better backup car since like my old turbo hoppers i usually break them eventually driving them through puddle water .	-1

my son just turned 3 he huge thomas fan . it very thomas birthday he got this set my aunt . previous reviewer mentioned , this not very interactive toy . my son turns it loves watching thomas race around tracks . he loves making thomas stop tower more water pumping it . sounds steam his favorite part . i found instructions lacking , though . pictures aren't very clear text convoluted . i'm reasonably intelligent woman i got very frustrated trying put batteries understand how whole thing worked . pump-action didn't work very well first , but after few false starts we got it filling up thomas wonderfully ( quite few spills , though , because hole so small ) . i give set four stars because my son enjoys watching it . he doesn't really " play " it same way he lego set wooden train sets - it not designed . if you're looking something use your child imagination - go either those sets instead . i'm probably going set this one up under our christmas tree this year	-1

my son recieved older version this game 7 years ago his second birthday . it one toy he kept playing over over again . mix it up little he'd race his other hotwheels his brother . some cars didn't work very well , some went faster than original cars which added fun . i am buying it little boy hoping he'll enjoy it much my two boys .	-1
bout this rc helicopter , it great gags stuff . really can't keep one spot very long , so i wouldn't say this heli hover . not inless you mod it some here their , but mostly won't beable move much . havoc more new start helicopter . why ? well it gose up down , you omost full control , sup you can't front or backs movement , least here their you ' ' keep it steady hover sometime . if your very good it . sure all helicopter fans stuff , it brake rotors stuff . but it called ' new ' . so it you're first time flying chopper . i would say buy havoc first , before moving reflex or any other chopper . again . every flying chopper or helicopter.is not little kids . let your mom or dad get use flying it before you let 5yearold play any chopper or helicopter , you putting you're $$ toy line when you send it you're little kids . i would say age 12+ flying these or any chopper/helicopter or adult	1
we purchased this our 10 year-old he loves it . he most thrilled see it really run bathtub . i think he would only happier if it came remote control so he could steer it	1

things i don't care bubble solution spills out when my daughter picks it up back handle . i wouldn't mind too much if i used this outside but we it indoors . also , intercom isn't easy play . when she pulls it cord stretch only few inches then pop back into place . maybe i just don't know how fix . overall i love this toy am very glad we bought this our kid . she plays it every day whether it sitting it or opening seat using it storage place . when she opened it up her birthday party several other kids rode it they ages 2-4 .	1

there plenty good reasons why ultra-pro recognized one safest best pagemakers sport fantasy card business . their pages pvc-free , which means there no oils pages eat away your collection . also , pages very sturdy handle your collection quite well . one note , however , i wouldn't put more than two cards per sleeve . fact , i'd only put more than one card sleeve if you're concerned space . one card per page best . i personally purchase hardboxes keep my doubles . overall , one , if not best , card page you purchase . fits all standard sized sports cards bulk fantasy card games lot kids enjoy these days . highly recommended	-1
we purchased this almost 2 years ago when my daughter 4 . it very durable , folds unfolds easily - it dragged all around house retained it shape nicely . it light weght so my daughter move it around set it back up herself . 6 years old , it still gets used but i think it close it end use . now she prefers make forts sheets but requires mom help so this still works when mom isn't available . our only complaint it bit small . even four , her friend could just sit it . it doesn't fit two kids bunch dolls - which what she really wanted why forts chairs sheets won out . but it used lot ' snack room ' . it used lot i would recommend it but if you find something similar slightly larger , i would say purchased instead	-1

this toy awesome 15 minuets ! however i think age specification this toy way wrong . this toy more collectors or " big " boys ! you know " look but not touch type " toy ! my son received this his 5th birthday he " loves " all his trucks very careful construction toys ! boom or arm excavator broke after 20 minutes play time it no longer lift anything ! rubber tracks fall off very easy well ! we taken toy apart it little plastic toothed disc moves arm ( plastic gear i guess ) , well it shattered . box not come parts list or place where get replacement parts . now i sad 5 year old who cannot play this huge costly toy ! very dissapointed even though " real " cat equipment durable , this " cat " not !	-1

i love this game years . so many words make such variety who you play against what letters might come up , it always different game every time you play it . only drawback noise when shaking up letters their box . i would like see version wasn't so irritating respect . tip , if noise bothers you you play game lot so it worth effort , put some thin felt strips box top ( kind self-adhesive backing ) so when you shake it , it makes less noise .	-1

i bought aquarium cars because * i * really liked them . my son likes them too but its difficult tell which way they supposed face . my son 18 mos old gets frustrated when magnets not aligned properly they repel one rather than attract . he gets mad throws them when this happens so i attest their durability ! they few nicks but thats it	-1

wanting your child learn math equations acurately , this not toy them . adding two numbers such 8 + 8 , should equal 16 , correct ? no , not this computer . you must first type 6 then 1 , backwards . i don't feel if child should learn math this manner . real sense , this should 61 not 16 . two digit numbers should entered way they suppose ! problem i dislike this laptop screen so small . i've also problem game : " next trend " when making mistake two digit number sequence computer pop up correct answer screen but say answer backwards . i find math games very frustrating	-1
this toy allows u see dark red led shines where u want it go its just really cool i dont noe how other person said it sucke	1
this definitely great product . my 2 1/2 year old daughter really seems enjoy it , especially little toaster ( toast ) tea set two . unfortunately , our food processor juicer combo appliance arrived defective . we tried different batteries thinking we purchased bad ones , but didn't seem case . i thought it little pointless 2 water pitchers , 2 scales 3 milk cartons when manufacturer could included purhaps something more practical like pot , skillet or pan . i also thought toy milk , water , butter flour boxes bit small side . i wouldn't expect them normal size toy kitchen but these items much smaller than even toy fruit . even though my comments critical , i think this fun , well made , creative product . i no regrets selecting it	-1
i like play legos . this looks like good deal only $9 . i see one problem this item . title says there 500pc description says there 200pc . so how many you get ?	1

i cannot understand why others found this toy so good , i don't . i live south fl , area where my indoor stereo picks up radio signals very well , but when i take this aqua radio outside , it almost impossible pick up station , once radio pool -- forget it ! volume above-water speaker minimal , apart sound so distorted we cannot hear thing . lucky me , i bought this discounted price under $6 , so it no huge loss trash it , which i already -- it not worth hassle cost send it back	-1
i old edition this wonderful game wanted get one my son his children . quality pieces really deteriorated since i got our original one many years ago . pieces very light weight . it unfortunate , but i think that just sign times	-1
this wonderful toy . it very easy play extremely durable . a++++	1
awesome . i've never owned version megatron even though my allegance always decepticons since i've intrest series . beggining my favorite starscream , i decided it time own version strongest spark found cybertron . i never liked his lugar versions first consepts , always thought it just stupid he could just change size when he became robot show . this year megatron one best transformers ive got , my favorite version him yet [ including his galvatron " tank " alter-ego , t-rex beast forms ] he transforms gun again , but this time its big chunky blaster scope instead lugar originally . this allows much better look robot form , good movement well placed joints , which often biggest problem transformers . it surprized me how evened out his robot form compared how contorted it form his gun mode . only unsymmetrical point his gun giant scope doubles giant blaster him robot form , it built into him so he all one very nice complex piece . sides gun become his wings , which little too heavy him stand striaght up , my only problem it . if your one who likes figure them out without instructions first [ like me ] it easy form him robot after little thought , then i clueless how get him back gun mode [ peek instructions ] . all i say his robot form much cooler but his gun mode feels little more useful second toy then other cars jets , collector or just getting into series , this definitly one you'll enjoy	1
we got this our son his second birthday . he loved it but we problems right away it didn't recognize when it dump truck or fire engine like it suppose would just go off no reason . course we awful time trying sneak it away our son . we went store get one they didn't work either . buy your own risk	-1

i hoped get this home sodor fire crew engines i already owned . it pretty good destination it came adapter you use rails or road . reason why i give this destination 4 stars instead 5 because fire truck slow come out garage times , you may want glue fire truck hose roof pieces so they not get lost ( i ) . despite this , i think it pretty good destination , it would make good addition your collection	-1
i just bought this my tea-party loving daughter . it perfect . yes , tea bags small but they perfectly sized child tea party . anything bigger would not fit into child tea cup/tea set . it sized scale . i would not buy adult size tea set my daughter ; therefore , i would not but adult size tea bags . we love them . perfect tea party dollie teddy	1

my oldest mr potato head when toy story came out . course cardboard box didn't last long pieces scattered lost but this set container plastic it easier keep pieces together hold their attention longer . it now played child # 3 , so i would say it definitely worth money . my only complaint would container could little bigger allow little hands put accessories away easier . but all all , it great toy	1
i bought this game play my 5 , 7 9 year old nephews . it easy them learn understand . they didn't tire playing it kept asking play game . best all , 7 year old just much chance winning adults . i bit disappointed quality cards , graphics began rub off around edges after only one day play	-1

i puchased this my son when he 6 months old he loved it ... then my nephew who 10 months younger fell love it . so we purchased two more one each baby my house one my nephews home . they play them long periods time we find our selves singing !!	1
this cute bubble machine . but honestly it isn't most well made toy all . handle becomes defective stays down . solution leaks bottom you don't get much bubbles coming out product	-1
i tried all " plug-n-play " handhelds -this one best . it very tough get money tournaments . i like programming because players more aggressive(they usually semi-loose semi-tight ) . i prefer play against aggressive opponents because it forces you make tougher decisions . if you really into graphics more than game you may find it substandard . even its few flaws youll find this game highly addictive entertaining .	1
this item works perfectly night light , probably one coolest night light out there . it perfect kids afraid dark . it left any phase moon , which helps control amount light emitted . it also set automatically change phases every five seconds . course , it also learning device , showing various phases moon up close comes cd , which we haven't listened yet . i like automatic shut off feature , so it doesn't matter if it left , which handy night . my first thought it appeared cheap could slightly more realistic , so 4 stars .	-1
this fun because one player gets host . if you know game well , you play just like tv show .	-1
we bought this my four year old christmas . there ton games choose . some games little hard him , but we help him he still loves it . it makes all sorts noise when you start it up sides slide out - it really cool little toy . i would highly recommend this toy any batman lover	1

not only my daughter love this toy , but i can't get over reviews saying how ugly it then say they like bratz . barbie original doll girls i can't get over fact people think bratz eewwwwww , prettier than barbie . i guess if you like show your children gaudy makeup half dressed ok then no wonder so many children like them . barbie always most eligant pretty doll out there	-1
if you serious playing cards you get these cards . there nothing else like them available . they extremely durable should last years home setting . they just like cards used wsop wpt . you won't regret buying these	1
this cutest top i've ever seen . it makes realistic train sounds train crossing gate lifts train pass . i given this toy several different children gift . it loud , therefore , bit scary very young child ( six months ) , but it very appropriate older baby or toddler . parent course pumping , but two or three year old should able it their own .	1
girls love all versions bratz . mom , i think bratz dolls look too mature their presumed ages . makeup way over top their clothing only compare " ladies night " . babyz underware only described thongs . however , finally kidz version improved upon . makeup still strong , but more acceptable . clothing closer what kid would wear overall look more innocent than other bratz dolls . if you've also found bratz dolls objectionable ( even though i still buy them ) , kidz version much more acceptable my 7 y.o. daughter seems like these better than any other version .	1
this home run leap frog . my three year old loves this game . he even plays it buy himself . he knows characters well other leap frog products so he comfortable it right away . it great teaching product i really think it would asset your collection . one thing i disappointed quality packaging . board ripped half it not store neatly . other than i give it a+	-1

my 4 year old son got this his birthday , even though he doesn't whole thomas set all tracks he lots fun it . he drives it all over house without any tracks just like he his matchbox cars . he used some his other duplos it built train stations , even incorporated it into his duplo castle . knights suddenly advanced quickly transportation department they now don't rely only their four legged winged friends carry them . granted all tracks etc . would probably excite him , so he'll get them christmas , but even it own this fantastic toy . pieces very durable easy little hands put together most importantly course take apart . it seems my son always likes toys he take apart put back together best . big plus all you mom out there , they're easy clean . unlike regular lego parts these easy just run under some water or wipe off because there actually enough it hold . even my 5 year old daughter who girly girl loves play this toy . this great toy	1
i bought this my 4 yo son store his leapster cartridges . it great job - big main compartment inside pockets , plus small outside pocket . problem strap - it supposed fit across body like messenger bag , but we can't seem get it fit him right no matter how we tighten it . it always sliding around his neck shoulder . price , i should purchased regular backpack . we always end up carrying pack hanging loop instead wearing it	-1
i picked this up closeout price ( too good mention ) because i loved both these games sega genisis . they still move just fast , playability still same . graphics pretty good remembering what genisis like , few details harder see . also names players not there , but ok . this great combination . i just hope they put together college football package , my alltime favorite ea game . check this out , price dropping you can't go wrong . this travels me play when i'm call . excellent toy all ages .	1
my 5year old this doll last year christmas , she got it then never really played it . it didnt make lot noises ( plus mom but not so much little girl wants cooing baby)it would ok if it wasnt 35 bucks it didnt come anything	1
while my son loves scoop lofty plays them ton , there basically nothing else this set , pieces you left won't build much anything . you see box you only able barely build facade house window two roof pieces , frame building . you least get caravan/little house door , windows , stairs travis set , my pick best series . even muck set comes recycling bins chute offers more play value . all vehicles , you can't play heavy them , pieces usually pop off . this set very pricey , so i would only get it if your child these two characters , becauase that all you paying . it should come little something better build , especially price	-1
i purchased this laptop my daugher 2 years ago paid almost double price . it well worth every penny ! over above any other education tool i bought her , she goes it first . when taking long car trips , it goes her . rainy days she can't play outside , she takes it her room . very educational she learned lot , especially foreign language tutor ( spanish , french , italian porteguese ) . it also helped her keyboarding skills which very important her school . she loves beating each level seeing how high she go . i hope they develop new product match her skill level she outgrows this one . definite must buy	1
this one best toys i bought my daughter . we bought it 6 months ago she still interested it . it so many things keep babys interest	1
my daughter loves this light . it saved me long nights fear sleeping dark . my daughter much more content night now . thank you very much !!!!	1
my son very disappointed when he received this item . it looks nothing like picture . picture shows whole container viewers you receive one baby blue view swirly sticker instead eye picture . i believe this false advertising , everyone should aware this . i wanted give it half star , but it not available	-1
this game system horrible . my son anted it xmas he played it once cause its so bad . graphics like ps1 best load times unbearable . im ' talking good 5 minutes just get started ... stay away this .	-1
this really fun product my son ; only problem i it placement alphabet squares one side . these placed so if little finger pushes far enough top or bottom " unlucky " angle , then pulls back , squares actually trap finger smash it bit . i only help my son get his finger out once , but i tried it after , it trapped my finger just easily . other than , again , it really fun kid-occupying toy	-1
these magnets gift we thought they would great . i agree other reviewer . their magnets not strong enough , one slides down fridge hits floor . activities too hard . you press everything really hard ... too hard little kids . one plays music doesn't play music either .... probably because it one slid down fridge hit floor several times . they look good theorey but reality not worth money . only redeeming quality two them my son likes slide them around , take them off , etc . but they no way actually anything they should . i suppose you could use one hold grocery list fridge ... but you get free magnets . i am just glad i didn't pay them	-1
we play this game so much we wearing out board . seriously ! even my husband likes play it . it really improved our daughters analysis strategy . it simple , cute , fun . i not say enough cute things this board game . we've played this game almost every single day since she gotten it , which x-mas . 4 year old child lifetime she still loves it just same first time we played it . now if isn't great game , we all family truly like playing then i dont know what . kudos manufacturer . simple , virtually unbreakable parts , simple memory based game . we however alter game , we let player win landing empty space well landing directly winning spot ( easier understand when played ) . this just makes it less frustrating little ones , but we re-instated original rules once tenacity game began . seriously ... buy this game . they get more out it then game like candyland . ( which we also enjoy play .	1

i teach preschool class many books tell you " put items bag kids identify them using only touch " . this game so much more ! there many cards you use each pictures 2-4 items category you need find . beginning , you should only use 1/2 items/cards it really hard kids adults . you spin spinner whatever card you land one you need find objects . you set 30 sec . timer reach try find items using only touch . back container see-through , so rest players see where you reaching . honest , i thought it would really easy adults , but my 6 year old doing better than several adults who tried it . it works right side your brain , so " right brained " people definitely advantage , but it fun all ages !	1
very durable , my daughter cannot destroy it , which plus ! great pictures great way get kids excited animals	1
although this purchased our 8 month old , kids all ages ( adults too ) find this toy very interesting . it fabulous teething toy well offering manipulative activity . favorite haba toy this age discovery blocks	1
i got this toy my 4 year old daughter . it great it comes twistable crayons ( perfect those us hate million broken crayons our childs crayon box ) , markers three stamp markers . stamps not stamp perfectly but hasn't stopped my daughter putting smiley face stamp all her art work . map pencils aren't her favorite color , but she loves write all different colors . it great take go holds everything perfectly place . i feel it absolutely great buy	1
this thing tips over very easily ! don't like it ! very hard pedal manage	-1
x-23 pretty nice figure . those die-hard x-men fans out there going ones who really know story behind her . she younger , female clone wolverine some different touches . most notably she only two adamantium claws coming out each hand claw comes out each foo t--t he latter feature nicely toybiz . claw manipulated so it folds back underneath figure foot . she new body sculpt very good this character . she supposed look more " girl " than " woman " . she not too tall or too " developed " . articulation pretty good , too . joints tight well concealed . head sculpt good considering past female characters . paint job looks nice clean . she also comes copy x-men #451 comic . it ok job showing you who x-23 -- you definitely see her action against wolverine . there version this figure available . it exactly same figure comic except head sculpt different her costume all black instead purple . plus , black one easier find . both very nice , but i am more pleased black version . this series called apocalypse series because , past series , 6 figures piece 7th , larger figure-apocalypse . apocalypse 5,000 -year-old mutant arch nemesis x-men . he turns out 14 inches tall he looks really , really good when he all assembled . he best one series . most people probably won't consider character selection this series best , so it good idea toybiz release these figures this way . personally , i love character selection idea building , larger figure . they should continue it future releases . everyone want put together their own apocalypse since he very hard get when he made his 6-inch appearance marvel legends 7 . two versions x-23 out there , it should easy purchase one or other , so if you want her apocalypse piece or not , you're still getting great action figure plays displays nicely .	-1
" must buy " . it only game i play my 9-year-old daughter we both enjoy . she developes her deductive reasoning skills fun . neither us get bored it . if you older parent like me ( 43 yrs ) it hard patience play children toys - especially bratz barbie . most board games designed children too easy adults . this strikes right balance . best all its not tie-in movie or cartoon chatacters .... shameless commercialisation , it really too much these days	1
this one better legendary riders he comes vehicle both makes sense , looks great . we finally true " villian " our two ( or three depending whether or not you count series vii varaint seperate figure ) ghost rider figures ml lines . vengeance looks great , i agree bone coloring package promotional photos looks great , but purple more comic acurate . one decent rider figures , one not overly hard find	-1
this toy fun combined two other bionicles set which include kopaka lewa , but this toy only educational value fact you build it . it very durable , ( only way it breaks if it falls apart)and i think it many good aspects , high rating deserved toy	1
