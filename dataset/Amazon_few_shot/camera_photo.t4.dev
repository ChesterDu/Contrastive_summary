i using this cord year , i problems its durability . it actually worked fine first 5 months , but then it started fall apart . when mounted hotshoe my flash bracket , thin plastic shoe ( where flash attached ) developed crack eventually broke off , making it useless mount flash . i buy replacement part canon ( who charged me $16 this small plastic piece ) . i flipped flash carefully then , but then it still cracked !! i wrote canon asked them reinforce bottom maybe made metal instead thin plastic . so far , there no response . few months later , cord , some unknown reason , makes my 550ex flash switch ettl ttl mode , making flash fire full power , overexposing entire image . i checked flash putting it directly camera hotshoe , flash worked fine , switching back ettl mode . piece equipment canon , it hard imagine it giving so many problems . it like they only paid tons more attention their cameras than their accessories . there no other oem manufacturers this cord , i am forced get one hope best .	-1
this camera incredibly frustrating . i must admit under ideal lighting conditions outdoors moderate fully sunny day , camera takes wonderful pictures . however , photos using indooor mixed lighting conditions leave alot desired . if you want take any indoor pictures natural light , this not camera you . reason if flash not activated or lighting not perfect , camera slows down shutter speed considerably . since camera not very good image stabilization ( if any ) indoor pictures blurry unless you hands surgeon . course you use flash , but then your subject overlit , while background pitch dark . forget taking long range pictures indoors ( i.e. graduation ceremony or wedding ) because if flash , you get black picture because camera not compensate shutter speed distance , it only adjusts whether or not it thinks flash . if it off , your picture blurred because shutter stays open 1-2 seconds . since i take alot indoor pictures , this camera worthless me . if you only plan take outdoor pictures ideal light , this camera you . if you want any natural light photography , forget it .	-1
i got this my s70 . first off , order use it , you set s70 " radio control " ( 9 button pushes ) . then you better stay no further away than six feet or so ( only * front * camera-the remote doesn't work rear ! ) . oh , if you want adjust your framing , forget i t-t he zoom immobilized . if you need " cable release , " i strongly suggest simply using self-timer built into camera . it gives you 2-second 10-second settings , you're almost certain steady tripod time .	-1

i owned this camera year i never really enjoyed it . point shoot it bad , it takes pictures way too slowly i often miss out good shot . it also not user friendly i would hoped it so many scene settings . while i enjoy some them , most time my pictures turn out grainy ( low light ) , whitewashed ( flash ) or blurry ( even slowly moving objects ) . i tried changing exposure time shutter speed counter some these things , but i rarely get good picture when i need it . i never these problems my elph s200 . this camera also lot more bulkier well , cover over lens started stick so it not fully open when turned . if given option i would not buy this camera again	-1

polarizing filters used eliminate glare non-metallic surfaces like glass or water . they also used increase contrast color saturation your image . i use my polarizer not only eliminate glare , but also make skies nice shade blue or get some " pop " out clouds . there so many options consider when purchasing polarizing filter your needs . instance , linear vs . circular , film or digital versions , or quality vs . price . if you making use ttl or auto-focusing system , circular polarizers designed work those features . linear polarizers their uses , but they manufactured differently may not work . unless you certain , just get circular polarizing filter . there some digital circular polarizers market . i am not sure what makes cir-pl lens better digital opposed film . i use canon 20d digital slr see no problems caused using supposed non-digital filter digital camera . most time , when it comes filters ; you get what you pay . mean you need expensive polarizer ? course not , just sure get right filter your needs . what ever polarizing filter you get , make sure it color neutral prevent unwanted tinting . spending more color balanced filter save time post . if you need multiple filter sizes , consider saving money using step down rings . currently i use hoya pro1 filters , canon polarizing filters i previously owned without question bulkier heavier . weight might not seem like much , but when you stick all your items backpack all extra bits weight add up quickly . i spend good amount time my equipment my back so this big concern me . when it came down images , times i would see browning tint my photos . tint easy clean up photoshop cs2 , but i don't see problem hoya pro1 filter . overall , i would recommend against canon polarizing filters . i originally thought , " it canon , it must quality . " since then i replaced all my canon filters . this filter works , but comes cost disadvantages other similarly priced filters . pros : used film or digital cameras eliminates internal reflections ghosting cons : bulky heavy not neutral color balance	-1
i love canon products i complete canon system 10 years . i love everything canon . however i not understand canon reasoning behind producing this lens . reason ef-s lenses offering wider angle getting rear elements lens closer " film " plane . they cannot this film full frame sensor cameras because mirror larger would hit rear elements ef-s lens . they indicated , however , 35 mm advantage gone . why then they produce 60 mm macro lens when they already their macro requirements covered they current three lenses ? i would guess short back focus makes lens cheaper ; but this lens only $60 short excellent 100 2.8 usm macro . i said , if $60 i get lens 40 mm more reach ( 66 1.6 crop cameras ; useful macro photography ) works all canon cameras , i'm not going thinking this lens all . granted , you might not thinking buying ff camera anytime soon , but canon indicated eventually they ff all their dslr , so why bother this lens ? 17-85 or 10-22 very reasonable offerings ef-s lineup , but 60mm macro doesn't make any sense me.my $0.0	-1
i purchased 8 10 photo frame way display photos my wedding reception planned use it my home thereafter . i able get product running load ' test ' set pictures , but product then ' froze ' startup screen . i checked pacific digital support website , which provided steps ( basically , sequence buttons hold down ) ' unfreeze ' reinitialize unit . i tried this sequence several times , no avail , then called pacific digital customer service . after repeated messages left voice mail system ( " we're sorry we missed your call - we'll get back you " ) all times day night , i unable contact anyone company no calls ever returned . long story short - our wedding came went , problem never ( apparently never ) resolved , digital photo frame now $390 paperweight . absolutely useless . my recommendation : not purchase pacific digital product . this clearly fly-by-night outfit	-1
i guess i really shouldn't complain because my husband won camera office rally . but pictures it takes disgraceful samsung product every two three pictures blurred unrecognizably-where you can't even tell what you taken . if you found yourself among fortunate few who actually found success this camera thank your lucky stars . even if it less expensive choice versus other cameras market today spend extra money it would worth it not miss any family moments like my family , this useless piece crap	-1
i this camera month first time it broke , i don't know why it broke . i set it down when i turned it back , it cracked . i then bought lcd screen repaired it myself , but two weeks later , i case it , put it my purse . i carried my purse around not set my purse down . when i took it out , it cracked again . i would not recommend getting this camera	-1
not buy this camera , i repeat not buy this camera ! just read reviews you'll know exactly what i mean . lucky i got this piece junk christmas , so i didn't spend dime it . i opened package before reading any reviews . now i wish i've read reviews before opening box . i don't care what setting you use , i tried them all i yet take picture any better than my cell phones camera . lighting sucks , you either end up dark pictures or super bright ones . i really wanted this camera work , it looks sweet but sadly it can't take pictures .	-1
bought this xmas present myself - bring family photos while business travel . i'm now 2nd unit ( exchanged directly w/phillips ) , am still same issue it not reliably working external ( my case , sony memory sticks ) . internal memory pitiful , unless you want resize all photos you put it , you not going able hold very many internally . i've yet get auto on/off feature work , while it perhaps pc friendly device , it certainly not always mac friendly - controls cumbersome work , directions meager . i wanted able carry this backpack or carryon bag , fact support stand can't folded tight against unit makes it difficult this - course , no mention this product description . also no mention it only supports older memory sticks - no support new , ms produo sticks ( no mention product descriptions either)i thought i would get quality product phillips , this certainly looked like it potential - unfortunately , it turned out piece junk , one i've screwing around so long it probably not returnable . don't waste your time dollars .......................	-1
these glasses should not bushnell name them , which misleads one think they good quality . i bought them my son , time i got around sending them , i discovered plastic housing cracked where front lens screws , so lens misaligned . it past 30-day return date , so i glued crack kept them my own use . they still not right , but i keep them my car occasional use . my advice -- spend some extra money get good pair .	-1
we bought this camera thinking it would our do-all " eurocam " upcoming trip europe . it promised sufficient range performance features easily meet our needs such trip . sadly , camera not up filling this role . we need take camera it . however , we take v705 its wide-angle lens , reason we picked this model first place . it this disparity advertised actual capabilities camera which prompts me contribute this review . need true wide-angle lens both sufficient necessary condition buying this camera . if you not need 23mm lens , or if you not know if you need 23mm lens , then you not need this otherwise mediocre ps ( point shoot ) camera . good : fairly decent 23mm wide-angle lens ; 23mm default lens ; rapid start-up time ; internal focus zoom ; chromatic aberration well controlled ; use 4gb cards ; freeze-frame extract any video frame . mediocre : soft images ; perceptible shutter lag ; slow sho t-t o-shot times ; exposure compensation easy , but steps too small digital , reset when camera turned off ; flash not come close covering 23mm ; image numbering basically limited 4 digits ; flimsy construction ; no manual controls ; no raw format ; no optical viewfinder ; histogram display , but too small useful . bad : absolute worst menu system found camera ; excessive unadjustable jpeg compression ; poor battery life very expensive external charger spare battery ; unacceptable visual noise starting asa-400 ; forced in-camera stitching panoramic images , inability save individual panoramic shots ; panoramic component images forced 5mp ; overlays panoramic delete modes so dark they obscure underlying image ( even display `bright ' ) ; mpeg-4 video compression gives very poor results . synopsis : if you need 23mm lens point shoot , this , older v570 , only choices . if most your images bright light , 7mp v705 gives better images . if most images low light , older , cheaper , 5mp v570 better choice . camera seems very fragile . treat it gently you likely happy wide-angle performance . if you chose this your sole camera , you likely unhappy your choice . only reason buy this camera wide-angle lens . = = = = = some expanded comments = = = = = twenty-three mm wide-angle fixed-focus lens . this lens almost decent optical quality ; though camera processing still produces overly-compressed soft images it . power-up 23mm initially active lens , which ideal us . however , considering this truly specialty lens , it would make more sense `normal ' lens should default . best would menu setting allow selection boot-up lens . better yet would camera only 23mm lens . camera firmware wide-angle distortion correction . this works fairly well , cost even more image softness , but even-so , barrel distortion noticeable degree not present actual 35mm-film camera wide-angle lenses similar focal length . this in-camera correction turned off . doing so allows one see marginal native lens performance . however , able turn off distortion correction exemplifies me how poorly thought out this camera . only people who would wish this those who exploring artistic limits camera - they would seem better served camera such basics : manual settings , physically larger sensor chip , raw image files , or , least , choice degree jpeg compression . other end camera focal length 114/117mm performance shows slightly below average image softness average pincushion distortion . there very few circumstances where one would want use `digital zoom ' , so , all digicams , claimed maximum telephoto length completely bogus . after reaching optical zoom limits , one much better off doing any further ' zooming ' editing program . kodak advertised " 5x optical zoom " , best , misleading . actually , it just flat out untrue . camera two lenses . only lens optically zoomed 39-114mm lens , which not quite 3:1 . wide angle lens fixed focal length . ( note , some places kodak claims 39-114 , others 39-117 optical zoom . ) also misleading claimed " anti-blur technology . " best i tell looking images , exif metadata , all this actually means some given shutter speed camera boosts asa . certainly there no optical image stabilization technology this camera . speaking asa . this opportune time address camera incredibly poor menu system . it byzantine : both awkward time consuming use . adduce , `auto ' asa ranges 50-200 , set faster ( or lock slower ) sensitivity rating requires going through multiple menu levels . change `auto ' next fastest ( 400 ) requires 11 manipulations 2 controls ! either other two pss which we taking it requires 4 pushes 1 control . menu system next unusable field . still asa settings , camera sensitivities up asa/iso 1000 ( though manual only documents asas up 800 , 1000 available camera ) . unless your shot once-in-a-lifetime , never-happen-again moment , then 200 max asa tolerable before noise shadows becomes annoying . 400 entire image suffers noise not really useable any print larger than 4x5 " . previous version this camera , v570 , only 5mp , but same sensor size . increasing pixel count , but not physical size sensor , new v705 camera actually more low-light digital noise than its predecessor . this happened many current ps cameras , makers advertise pixel count measure image quality . my initial experience low-light high asa use this camera you might well set capture size 3 mp , larger files only marginally better printing capability because severe noise artifact . approach dealing sensor noise use one commercially available products which , when calibrated sensor camera , allows subtraction much internally generated noise . doing so allow semi-adequate 8x10 " prints asa 800 . if one really wants get carried away , combining preceding any image stacking programs designed astrophotography ( where dozens/hundreds/thousands images averaged together ) makes 8x10 asa 1000 doable . people willing undertake these manipulations likely not fit kodak target market . back earth . v705 still-image quality below average this generation 7mp ps cameras . mostly i believe this because overly aggressive jpeg compression , which not adjustable ( e.g. `best ' , `good ' , etc ) . my guess compression setting 30-40 used . this results small files , lot compression artifact . 7mp jpegs this camera 1.2 - 1.5 mb size , those 7mp ps i 5-6mb . my 6mp prosumer digital slr jpegs 8-10mb . more compression , worse image . most cameras allow user pick trade-off point . kodak picks it you , picks poorly . v705 video performance very disappointing . it uses mpeg-4 compression , very aggressive compression settings . unless it video your baby first steps , or aliens landing backyard , you likely find it hard watch . total output datastream 0.5 mbs . compare this minidv tape video datastream 25 mbs ( total , adding sound , error correction , time codes , 36 mbs ) . better stuck mpeg-2 which would give less compression , but decent enough ( tv quality ) videos . choice most manufactures made . result , videos my other pss 2 mbs datastream , so much better quality . battery . kodak claim 150 still images per charge . i am getting 100-120 , minimal use flash lcd `energy saver ' . even 150 would poor , compared my other digital pss , where i expect least 200 , often get 250+ if i am all careful power-management . this camera proprietary ( hard remove ) 720 mah battery . my ( several ) other , pss 790-1120 mah batteries , , i suspect , more efficient processors . since we only going using this camera wide-angle , battery likely last most day . we not bought external charger backup battery because cost 25% cost camera . though body aluminum , camera itself overall fragile i doubt hold up more than year or two . battery media doors not appear designed actual repeated use ; there no cover charge socket . media door often dislodges open . truly , my belief kodak designed this camera thought these doors would never used : camera would spend its life simply taken out ( not included this model ) " easyshare " dock system . this would also explain relatively large amount built memory , overly aggressive jpeg compression . shutter lag , b�te noire digital cameras , very evident this model . i not any method actually measuring time pressing shutter , image recorded . however , based over 50 years tripping shutters , it clearly varies , i estimate , best 1/4 second , up bit over 1/2 second . addition shutter lag , there perceptible lag lcd viewfinder screen showing what front lens . together this makes capture fleeting moment , active child particular instant , or wary animal almost impossible . shutter lag much more evident than same-generation/price ps cameras other makers . accompanying `manual ' poorly organized , childishly written . " finish reading this book , so you take share your best pictures ! " best , it written 8 year olds . manual make reference web-address where one download `full manual ' , however address given incorrect . when eventually found , manual better than one enclosed camera - it contains some information one could not figure out oneself - but it also written no more than fourth grade level . panoramics , one advertising points camera , disappointment . basically way it works 2 or 3 images taken `panoramic mode ' , each subsequent shot overlain thin strip preceding image , order allow alignment . most `panoramic modes ' focus exposure locked first image . so far , this all ok ; however , it rapidly goes downhill . first , max image size individual shots limited 5 ( not 7 ) mp . next , image overlay so dark , even lcd set max brightness , it difficult see through mask align elements . however , it gets worse . images must joined in-camera ! individual images cannot stored ! in-camera processing very slow very battery hungry . aligning overlaps grainy 1.5 x2 " lcd field gives , spite camera best efforts , much poorer results than aligning them much bigger , higher quality , computer display comfort controlled lighting your home . best way take panoramas this camera use lightmeter determine exposure each segment , then simply take appropriate series images 7mp single-stills , making exposure compensation adjustments based your light-meter readings . course , my smallest lightmeter almost large this camera , so we not dragging it . you eyeball needed ec close enough should able match exposures up production . much better if v705 allowed individual images saved . reading back through this review , i see it mostly negative . this makes sense , , i disclosed beginning , it my disappointment this camera actual vs advertised capability which led me write review first place . likely i said all needs said . so i just close mentioning only reason we not send camera back because wide-angle lens . except this unique lens , camera performance ease use below similarly priced ps cameras currently market . if you need true wide-angle ps , you need this camera . otherwise forget it	-1

i got this camera when it rather new . i am not extremely pleased it . it not acting this way because it 2 years old ... it like this when i bought it . -first all ... it no lens cover so you keep it camera bag . incase you touch lens without relizing ... all your pictures ruined . -it takes ever take picture . you wait like 2 seconds picture taken . -it eats up batteries like crazy-it takes forever turn on-if you flash setting autoflash , camera still flash bright sunligh t-t he pictures extremly blurry when you print home-it no optical zoom ( but zoom really customer choice .	-1

my primary use this camera take pictures indoors very bright lighting , without use flash . camera couldn't handle taking pictures without flash all , despite it extremely bright room ( 5 different lights plus 3 overhead halogen track lights ) . camera shutter speed so slow it nearly impossible get picture wasn't blurry . maybe 1 every 4 pictures came out clear . i believe fact its 10 megapixel camera what it . i used cannon powershot sd450 awesome , but it stolen so i needed replacement . i no complaints 450 it took same type pictures bright indoor lighting just fine without flash , unlike 900 . i am sure camera would fine people who always use flash or take their pictures bright sunlight but my purpose , this camera horrible it since returned . instead , i just got fuji finepix f30 , which supposed better without flash . we'll see	-1

i own many sony products , including sony cybershot dsc-f717 , which i love . however , i am very disappointed this camera , sony cybershot dsc-t5 . i bought t5 my mother father present . it small , lightweight , portable ; easy use ; stylish . it take nice photos brightly lit environments , especially outside . however , after several months use , few problems become consistently evident : ( 1 ) there horrible red-eye ( white-eye ) artifact many pictures . so-called " red-eye reduction " setting nothing . ( 2 ) dim-light photography very grainy , lots noise . nigh t-t ime photography impossible . these problems not unique our camera ... you find many corroborating reviews above . overall , i am very disappointed this camera , wish i could exchange it something else . not buy this camera . other reviewers suggest t7 or t9 take much better pictures ( they still small pocket-size cameras ) .	-1
i made mistake selecting bundle without reading requirements closely . lens variety canon cameras but adapter only works a6xx series . my adapter arrived it doesn't work my camera . kinda misleading now i spend more buy correct adapter separately . bummer . also , captain jack correct vignetting . this lens sort like magnifying class sits front built-in zoom lens . if you zoom wide angle , you see horrible vignetting he mentioned . if you stay zoomed , it works ok . disappointing	-1
this camcorder terrible just every way : cons : - unacceptably blurry video ; specs say it records 640x480 , but it looks more like 320x240 ( if ! ) blown up vga . - noticeable aura around any dark shape lighter background . - awful light sensitivity ; forget recording indoors -- no matter how brightly room lit , faces come out too dark . built-in led don't help much ( not all distances over 4 feet subject ) . - noisy zoom gets picked up loud clear microphone . - zooming goes irregular steps -- completely useless while recording . - video lags noticeably behind camera movement ; when image stabilization turned , lag becomes so atrocious you can't tell when stop panning -- utterly useless ! - when using av-in av-out cables , firmware frozen me couple times ; only way reset camera remove battery . - video encoding ( through av-in cable ) produces unacceptably noisy undersaturated result . - lcd display very narrow viewing angle ; anything more than 10% you can't make out thing . - still photos taken native 5mp resolution come out strangely grainy uneven -- something like " sharpen " effect gone wrong . i get better looking pictures my 2mp canon powershot a40 camera . - manual recommends keeping camera motionless 2-3 seconds after snapping picture ( that top 3-4 seconds it takes thing focus before it snaps ); but you can't keep subject moving , folks ! welcome psychedelic land image trails ... - flash photos come out wildly different color balance depending color background . - manual sorry affair -- only 17 pages long doesn't go much beyond identifying external controls menu options . - i could go , but i'll stop now , you probably get picture ... pros : - camera body seems sturdily built ; controls also sturdy feel them , battery usb port covers . hmm ... it only nice thing i think say it . maybe child ( think pre-teen ) could find this " camcorder " exciting toy , but i don't see how it enough even undemanding person looking capture occasional life moments video	-1

when i bought this camera sales people tried get me buy battery . they said one came it would only good 20 minutes . now i bought alot items my lifetime , 20 min battery camera just doesnt seem like very good " business " choice . so i said no . so i got camera , charged battery until light went green ( which sucked because i wanted play it right when i got it ) started taking pictures ( oh i also got 2g cf ) worked great .... so i planned go up mountain take soem scenery shots . keeping mind what sales person told me i pocketed charger just incase . well , 6000 ' , 300 pictures , 5 hours later camera still running strong , still 200 shots left trip home , battery life indicator hasnt budged off full button . so all all , i think battery life great , now i see if your taking say thousands pictures all row you may need but just going trip shooting few pictures every stop point , original work fine . quality photos ..... i love them	1

" wow ! " all i say express my reaction after getting prints taken my 17-40 . i've using nikon manual-focus nikkors since 1988 always satisfied color sharpness . however , after using canon " " series , i've sold lot my nikkors . color , clarity , sharpness , detail " " lenses amazing . prints this 3-d effect ( without use those silly red/blue glasses ! ) 8-) within 3 weeks receiving my 17-40 , i ordered 70-200 . those two lenses replace my whole nikkor collection . build really good . " " zooms little bulkier , but very managable . nikkors smaller , but very heavy . but lense technology coatings improved so much 20 years , i see difference . i tested lens pointing it toward sun . 17-40 surprising handles flare very well . sun just outside field view , there very little flare loss contrast . i also make 12x18 prints , this lens handles them easily . body going limiting factor ( refering digital bodies ) . warning : once you use " " glass , you going spoiled . you may not settle consumer lenses anymore , although some non-l lenses quick good what i read	1
i am 67 years old started out photography kid contact printer box camera . i all types cameras over years , mostly 35mm film canon slr . i too bought all sorts these 5-7 mp point shoot digital cameras before returning my true love , slr . i my digital canon rebel xt month now i can't keep my hands off it . it lacks nothing . although kit lense good , i bought 28-135 canon zoom lense image stabilizion produced stunning photo it . i love way you use 7 points focus , i mainly use only center point focus lock never get out focus picture . i guess nicest thing me i now don't urge buy every point shoot camera paraded out qvc or hsn " wonderful " new feature like " low light or non-shake . " this canon every good feature known universe you can't outgrow it . its camera let you good you , it won't hold you back . battery life great , built flash good but i bought 430ex that even better . i never figure i'm wasting money buying accessories this camera it my main squeeze many years come . i always missed my 35mm canon slr now feel i old friend back again , only much much better . believe me , you can't go wrong getting this camera , its beyond description ...	1

i've this lens 2 months now , love it . it my first " " lens i see quality difference this line . first , i tried 28-135 is-pretty good . but i wasn't totally happy , so returned it ordered 24-105 . now i'm happy . contrast , sharpness , ca much better . build quality feel superior well . plus really works . i try get all lens future , i believe it worth extra cost . focusing very quick zoom action smooth steady . if you're budget , 28-135 real nice . but go all way , i recommend this lens . 24-105 quieter i found . price bit steep , but optical quality there , resale value remain good , weather sealing should hopefully keep dust junk getting inside this lens .	1

i purchased this photographic store because professional said you shouldn't go higher than 1.4 . just keep mind -- 1.4 only " 40% better " . it worked really well , but didn't increase zoomage enough . i decided go 2x ( that twice zoomage ) teleconverter kenko instead . i gave this one my brother-in-law christmas . you think what you want -- i want get really close birds . i 70-300mm zoom lens 1.4 takes it 98-420mm . it improvement , but not nearly enough ! if you want get twice close , this isn't going it you . if you want get half-again-as close , this almost gets you there . far quality , quality definitely there . five stars quality , 3 insufficient zoomage	1
unlike many reviewers i am not diver . i bought this peace mind my camera wouldn't get ruined taking pictures my son water park , pool , beach . this equipment exceeded my expectations always clear photo underwater flash . this case out lived s400 s500 . well worth $170 price tag	1
this perfect camera me . i take alot close-up detail shots images come out great . it smaller than my old g3 ( which i loved , but pretty chunky )	1
i bought my k10d dec 06 after owning number pentax cameras over years very pleased engineering . combination features , if executed properly , make this camera best buy 10mp dslrs right now . i postponed my review because i wanted get some real field experience . i just went mexico , panicked because i left camera instruction manual behind . i now report trip . i little fumbling first , mainly because i didn't manual , but i soon able find combinations i wanted , camera performed both flexibly intuitively . af button exposure compensation button very well placed . i found myself difficult lighting situations often , both af exposure metering worked quite well . i also took some hand-held shots i normally would use tripod ( such 450mm ) , very few came out fuzzy because camera movement . few cases , i used bracketing , easily able obtain good balance details one or more bracketed shots . exposure metering worked so well i stopped bracketing . i particularly liked display modes : i could boost brightness see display even bright daylight , deep zooming gave me good check whether shot " soft " or not right scene . rechargeable li ion batteries , although not readily available stores , seem last forever ( even using power zoom , full-bright display , some fill flash ) . i believe i could shot all week ( 700 shots raw ( dng ) + jpeg ) battery grip attached . summary , this camera pleasure hold , very easy use manipulate , resulted high percentage crisp photos ( even if percentage well-composed shots lower because photographer ) . i bought it because its compatibility pentax lenses , 10mp sensor , shake-reduction technology , larger display , especially dust water seals . but what makes me quite happy it its overall ease use good results . i am still discovering its features , but i already know this camera frees me creative ways other cameras not past . some features this camera unique ( new program lines ) some available only cameras costing several hundred dollars more , making k10d good choice best buy . once again pentax , engineering supurb .	1
if you expecting clear professional sound transmission , this not it . that wireless system costing $ 1,000 - $ 3,000 . this system strictly home none professional use . i think people expecting this system deliver hi fidelity sound they hear movies or tv soundtrack . professionals not use this system . reason low price . home movies only .	1
third camera kodak easyshare . great performance pics . slendor size	1
i bought this one cheap extra battery . i seen no differences performance so far would therefore recommend this great extra or replacement battery	1
after reading dozens reviews both this case psc-55 , i still undecided case my canon sd630 . so , i purchased both see myself which one would work . because red my favorite color , i really wanted red case fit ( psc-90 ) . camera fit case , but it very tight fit . i shove camera case make snap close . psc-55 still very snug fit , but allows some extra breathing room which i feel better safety camera . addition , here something consider if you're deciding two cases : inside lining psc-90 more rigid nylon material , while lining psc-55 softer felt material . case overall still rigid , but i like thought my camera resting against softer lining . based alone , i'm going psc-55 - i feel this more friendly 3 " screen sd630 . both cases very nice leather very attractive - i'm pleased canon brand	1
first it little hard get my pictures look good samples , but i found re-sizing them inch or so computer before downloading them they show up alot better . also , ones higher contrast easier see farther away . just look samples come pre-loaded remind yourself it possible get great-looking pics surprisingly high resolution . after few practice downloads i thrilled results . ** plus : this one came wall charger . most plugged usb charge . wall charger makes it perfect share vacation when you're away your computer	1

i stumbled across this little gem accident . i picking up supplies office depot they kodak z650 ( display model ) sale under $100 . it ridiculous impulse buy -- i already own 4 digital cameras ... last thing i needed camera ! but what delighful suprise this camera turned out ! it come closest rivaling image quality my old olympus c-740 . i never seriously looked kodak cameras ... i always steered clear them based bad press negative comments them my friends who " serious " photographers . but i couldn't happier this little bargain ... it basically serves need i wanted fill -- 6mp camera takes kind quality shots i used my c-740 . there few negatives it little slow processing shots , but there very little shutter-lag when taking shots . i've gotten some amazing birds-in-flight shots it -- something i've never able accomplish any my other cameras , including c-740 . some low-contrast shots come out bit noisy , but most part shots very crisp sharp . it handles low-light settings better than any others this class i've tried . less than third price my canon s2-is , this little camera outclasses others mile . i stumbled good find z650 ... it not going give you dlsr quality photos , but no point-and-shoot . this camera perfect any one who likes take great outdoor wildlife shots . i just wish someone would given good report kodak cameras before i spent small fortune others	1
images this camera very high quality . 18x optical zoom very usable only minimal distortion noticeable extremes . optical image stabilization system ( based stabilizing ccd image sensor instead lens elements ) quite good performed well under several different circumstances ( moving car , boat , shaky hands ) . my main gripe this camera lack high speed usb 2.0 support . fine print says usb interface " full speed " which means maximum transfer rate 12 mbit/s instead 480 mbit/s possible high speed usb . so , downloading photos camera through usb interface painfully slow compared most current generation digital cameras such canon sd900 . software provided camera somewhat difficult use slow unresponsive . it would also desirable if camera could accept lithium ion rechargeable battery addition or instead 4 aa batteries it uses . but , battery life both alkaline rechargeable nimh aa batteries adequate .	1
looks exactly posted picture except badge reads " panasonic " , not " lumix " . fits camera perfectly . no extra room memory cards , spare battery , charger , etc . it easier insert camera both zippers down . belt loop won't fit most belts . no straps . however , camera strap good enough . good protection	1
i shot my second feature ( flying tiger ) dvx took it cannes film fest market no one could tell it wasn't film . this camera fantastic if you shoot right . i suggest this camera over all other similarly-priced models . we extensive testing many cameras this my favorite . jvc many thousands more you get less grain it dark areas , true , but money , dvx , if you shoot properly it , get you amazing results . proof , you check out footage shot ton lighting conditions my site . we best luck natural light , simple chimera diffusers . if you're honest yourself don't plan hitting lottery anytime soon ( getting real distribution deal/full 35mm blowup ) you need good looking film fests or dvd , there no way you should shoot film , or camera . we shot full feature no money many distrib offers , all because look this camera gave us . i'm planning using it again my next film . ! viva la revolucion ! put dvx 24p advanced mode rip knob off	1
very easy use , multiple languages , something nice easy even unexperienced users . recommend anybody buy it , it worth it . price right features mp . i would not hesitate pay more this camera . kodak wonderful job this	1

not too hard not too soft . camera fits nicely , compartments just anything you need your camera .	1
this camera easy use makes good quality recording . since it upper end product , it longer learning curve than more simple models but effort worth it added features . there , however , few quirks which could fixed make this much more usable piece equipmen t.t he provided microphone jack 1/8 " stereo . my camera , least , it not mounted very securely . when i external mike connected , i very careful make sure nothing touched it , otherwise , sound would drop off . friend some tools expertise fixed this problem but it should never happened . master switch moves off vcr mode ( up one ) , record tape mode ( down one ) or record stick mode ( down two ) . it intuitive but very easy overshoot mark . this frustrating i cannot help but believe there better design could used . " vcr " controls located top surface camera . they intuitive employ commonly used symbols . they also backlit impossible discern sunshine . you see symbols but there no way tell which , if any , functions selected . it still usable but it pain backside . there multitude things could make interface this camera easier use but it usable it now .	1
i've other 3 digital cameras this best i think , i shots very quick , flash brighty , even soft flash more natural shots . browse pictures very fast lot posibilities edit inside camera , light tiny slim . one best cameras . i don't find negative feature it . i love it	1
i just got my new camcorder start operate it . first all is very easy operate joystick , use still image function allways available , even while shooting video ( nice feature but all camcorders - low quality pitures ) stabalizer ( one reason why i'd preffered cam over other ) great even full zoom you get pretty steady videos . large zoom ( x32 ) also very nice . overall i think this great value my money ....	1
this lens best its class . i wish every lens i this sharp . this thing top notch	1
i picked up canon 350d while i italy . i thinking upgrade camera canon didn't built flash . this flash great , i've only used it few times , but i am more than impressed it functionality . title , i only said " oops " because i think it more flash than i really need , least this camera . overall , i am more than impressed this flash	1
excellent camera high end capabilities . easy use intuitive system controls	1
this standard kit lens comes rebel 20d . this lens most definitely built budget . it ever show ! completely inexcusable lack numbering any kind focusing ring . this very frustrating when it comes taking pictures distant objects , since you cannot simply set it infinity . also , because it goes into macro mode beyond infinity , you cannot simply crank it all way one side ! course , you always use autofocus if you wish . but this doesn't work night photography . fact , you might well forget doing any night photography this lens due inability focus it based estimation distance ( fact autofocus doesn't work dark ) . besides this nagging problem , lens just not very sharp . when i first got my rebel , i very impressed pictures it took , since all i compare it pictures taken point-and-shoots . but after taking several hundred pictures it , i find most cases , pictures very much soft side . this particular problem distant objects . even when focused those distant objects , they never appear really sharp , although objects intermediate distance ( ~ 100ft ) seem okay . let face it . this lens just doesn't it . unless you really hard up cash , steer clear	-1
excellent addition rebel xt . tried lower cost generic flash units . my only regret i waited so long get 430ex	1
exceptional images ! i shoot indoors low light due large aperture . lens bit heavy though ! i choose this lens 24-105 f4l lens . i went 24-70 2.8 wider aperture . i no regrets ! i miss additional reach 24-105 f4l lens , but this compromise i willing make . once again , excellent lens	1
it what it supposed . nothing more , nothing less . if it little cheaper , i would given it 5 stars .	1
this must product any digital rebel xt owner . always carry spare fully charged battery . amazon competitive pricing structure very timely delivery	1
i forgot my wife birthday she subsequently hinted she wanted telephoto lens ... i started looking cheap ones , but decided , i might well it right if i going it all . when it arrived , my wife took it out box we both stunned how massive this lense . it heavier than you might think well ( which means mounting ring come packaged this lens absolute god-send ) . first thing we go out buy mono-pod it . next we took it camping then water-skiing ended up some most incredible , crystal clear shots we've ever seen . autofocus incredibly fast - i able hold down button snap through multiple exposures while speeding across waves . most time - thing right . we then mounted it tri-pod shot family portraits . this first time we all kids grandkids together six years once again - lens didn't let us down photos fantastic . i don't any real training camera ( i use cannon rebel auto-focus most time ) but this lens worth every dime . ... it also worked get me out dog-house my wife ..	1
recycle times fantastic . batteries seem last forever . much less expensive than alternatives	1
up front : if you're considering this lens , stop considering - buy it . i occasion try tamaron zoom this range noticed plastic-y digital qualities some tamaron highlighted-texture areas . none problem this canon beauty . i am using it my normal lens . contrast razor-sharp enough shave . it graphic monochrome colors pure leap off monitor like politician attracted tv camera . it also light weight plenty fast enough practically no spherical abs .... tiny problems include understandable perspective bulging subjects edges . there some blue fringing very high contrast edges . photoshop nails latter dead'er than britney spears ' career . i've need reasonably large blow-ups , most captures cropped , yet still enlarged up prints minimally 13x20 . size not only this lens reproduce subject pores , but you peer down see stuff inside craters .	1
i bought this camera february , it really great job so many different situations . unfortunately , i lost it this past september kicking myself ever since . i purchasing exact same camera again . excellent features include : easy usesmallgood quality ( long they aren't extremely close ) picturesi like software came cameragood accessories , esp . camera caseclear lcd screengreat options picture takinggood features include : fast shutter speed , although not quite fast enough . i'd like take more pictures faster repetition but cannot this camerai recommended this camera my best friend who lighting designer retail spaces ( dolce gabbana , instance ) he gives it excellent review well , so i know it good all types light professional purposes	1
nice intermediate level flash , works great within its perameters	1
this lens very versatile , offering good wide angle good head-and-shoulders portrait length . it internal focusing , which helps speed close-focusing performance , image stabilizer better low-light performance . particular benefit those shoot darker open areas , like wedding photographers churches . , combined flash , allow use get more background detail indoor events . no longer we accept dark , dungeon like backgrounds ! ideally , lens would little bit brighter ( say , f4 top end ) , bit heavier built . but then again , we could $ 1,000 more	1
ok -- allow me mention only thing i dislike charge this camera battery , you remove battery put it small wall charger . battery charge seems weak i charge it lot more than old one . my last sony digital camera ( recent one , too ) plug fit into camera you'd charge it while it sat downloading or just " parked " ... i get bit nervous opening closing battery door constantly . that what nikon coolpix i . :/ now said , i gotta shout - i love this camera . slim fit into my pocket or small purse , lens covers when it off , screen i already plastic guard , photos quality . hard take bad pic this ! i'd say " i'd buy it again ! " but i already -- gift my son ! two thumbs up ease use , quality pics , , great price	1

i lot research picking out camera wish i known this camera before purchasing nikon p3 ( wifi ) . i happened receive refurbished sd700 right before our honeymoon took both test them out . what better place than kauai take some great shots ... so , after first day shooting i came conclusion canon better camera hands down !!! matter fact it best camera i've owned i'll never get brand again . there several things set this camera apart others : 1 . picture quality scene modes ( beautiful beach floral mode)2 . picture quality auto ( true sign good camera)3 . 4x zoom ( unbelievable - best feature ... took pictures lighthouse mile away looked like i right front taking it . i also used camera binoculars see mountain goat wimea canyon picture unbelievably clear)4 . battery life5 . user controls softwarei really can't find anything bad say this camera . i didn't get chance even read manual before our trip figured out all " bells whistles " fairly easily . point shoot camera , this canon delivers professional quality like no other ! definitely great purchase	1
i just purchased this camera lens ( lens different set ) it blown me away so far . pictures just incredible . focus , metering , exposure , flash , color balance ... everything perfect so far . i mainly used camera full automatic mode it really shines . its simple point shoot this mode . i used camera difficult lighting situations photos incredible . there no noticeable shutter lag , which very important me . i 6 yo son who goes smiling one moment looking away next . i missed so many photos past due shutter lag , but not problem this camera . feature helps continuous mode . i take 3 pics second up 100 pics then select best . generally i find i get good pic like 10-15 photos . i used serious photo hobbist during days film , but always problems finding darkroom develop my film . darkroom issue shear cost film paying processing made me abandon hobby . but this camera really bringing back excitement this hobby again without trials expense darkroom . only downside this camera price , but this instance , you get what you pay . you might able save buck or two camera , but i wouldn't even try . i can't imagine camera taking better picture . way , i love this lens . 18 55 mm focal length nice every day lens . its much wider angle then you find point shoot cameras , yet you still get close . i 55-200 mm lens well , but i find i use 18-55 lens more . shorter lens great confined spaces , where you can't easily back away subject , its always better move closer your subject than use long lens ( unless you can't safety reasons ) . my only regret waiting so long get dslr camera this quality . it really opened up old hobby me .	1
love it , it fits my sd450 perfectly . it snug durable fits great my purse when i bring it me . i definitely recommend this !!	1
i rebel xt 8 lenses thinking getting upgraded second camera body . so when it came out 30d logical choice , but it not really much upgrade 20d , which i resisted , so i not really sure what . then i all but decided just take plunge get 30d when i heard first rumblings xti . then i started learn details xti , more mega pixels , same auto focus , same screen , picture styles , dust cleaning ! only areas 30d won my opinion build quality , spot meter , estimated shutter life . those 3 categories not enough convince me 30d worth $300-$400 more than xti especially since xti won or tied most categories . way i look it camera bodies not nearly important lenses , they change so fast it not worth it me spend more longevity when it outdated year anyway . spend $ 1,500 lens , use it lifetime , spend $ 1,500 camera body , regret it year . i fully expect upgrade 30d released within year , now i saved getting xti i all much more put towards it when it comes out . so basically what i am saying , my opinion , xti just good , if not better than semi-pro 30d , so why pay more ? switching xt xti very simple , i use them both now without any problems . batteries , battery grips , remote shutter release , most other accessories also compatible both , which nice keep amount gear you need carry minimum . unless you want move up full frame sensor , i can't see any reasons why you would not want go this camera . if you read books photography just 1 or 2 years ago you realize this " entry level " camera features not even available top line ($ 5,000 +) camera bodies . speed camera bodies advance you might well buy entry level body every year instead making huge investment pro level bodies then shown up something 10% price year or two . not there not reasons buy one those bodies , i just don't seem any them	1
i surprised just how big this rubber blower . it size , it doesn't blow much air out - maybe little bit more than rubber squeeze toy dogs . speaking dog toys , this item squeaks everytime i squeeze bulb . bottom line this item actually works helps remove dust your sensor . because , it solid pick-up ..	1

canon 250d 500d doublet type close-up lenses which corrected chromatic abberation ( " achromat " ) . they offer better performance than less expensive singlet type lens . i happy performance these lenses used ef 100mm/ 2.0 , even when used stacked together higher power ( which canon not recommend )	1
powershot a520 switch stopped working right after i started using camera	-1
this quality piece take good close-up pictures still objects . i looking something capture moving/flying insects , this not what i needed . my fault not lense .	1

this very powerful flash unit works master other canon flash units . you get very nice results small amount experimentation . it what it suppose . i used it 420ex i've several years it worked fine . mounted camera it larger version built popup 30d some extra niceties lots more power . thinking 430ex ? cough up few extra bucks this baby , you'll glad you . it one shot deal , [ no pun intended ] , you'll using it years come . i bought 420ex my elan ii 6 years ago . it great unit . this one recharges faster gobs more power . you'll love it ! don't let all dials switches scare you , read instruction manual	1
i'm no means expert ! this first digital i owned . it took me long time because i so used my film camera . but i searched long hard find what i thought i wanted . so far i am not disappointed . first size threw me because everyone else bigger camera i felt it would hard handle take good pics . but that not case . i like feel , size ... i like able throw it my purse ... it takes great pictures use my e-bay , sending family friends . i haven't any pictures printed it yet , so i don't know how exactly they come out , but i'm thinking they should okay since my online pics great . i haven't single blurry pic , both regular close up . video works well ... it lots little options i don't use .. like sounds each function , but i change those if i want . overall i no complaints	1
this high quality extender great addition my canon ef 70-200 f/4 !! top-notch build quality tough , weather resistant design equal their highly respected line quot ; lquot ; lenses , canon produced great product its unbeatable zoom lens !! although 2x extender renders a/f function useless many canon cameras , i found this very small drawback overall ( i prefer manually focus under many my shooting conditions ) . this extender more suited low f/number lens due 2-stop change brightness , but it still very effective my f/4 normal lighting . lightweight fairly inexpensive way double your focal length , while maintaining incredible optical quality main lens ... my backpack always contain my 2x 1.4 extenders !	1
kodak made printing pictues simple 123 . paper cartridge snaps place quite easily . it removed quickly stored out way because paper protected its own tray convenient lid . this high quality paper protective coating applied photo give it many years durability . i thought price competative other methods printing photo paper	1

what you say , other than it 4 times cheaper than 50f 1.2 . not , but great bright fast quiet lens , small optically superb . crop camera it 80mm portrait lens . super	1
other than months waiting nikon deliver them amazon shipping , battery itself good deal . they work well , charge up easy hold their charge nicely . priced well , they cost less than same type battery than canon or sony . i bought them d80 older en-el3a would not fit . course i 10 older batteries my d70s rather surprised when they didn't fit d80 . basically same size shape , but keyed differently . i also surprised find 3e would fit d70s , meaning they backward compatable .	1
i decided rave this lens after taking 80 portraits , or head shots , children theater production . i set aperture 1.8 shot away inside temple great indirect soft lighting . results exquisite ! background , located five feet behind subjects subtle blur while subjects came life ( single strands hair resolution ) . not bad my first experience shooting portraits . now better part i get equal or better results thousands pictures i taken high school basketball games . i set my iso 400 my digital rebel xt get shutter speeds 1/200 1/1250 . again , intended subject jumps out . there no red eye ( or white eye ) using flash light scene freeze action . so after much experimenting , i prefer this my 70-200 f4/l my 24-105 f4/l lenses indoor sports lens . i love all these lenses . this one wins area price fastest lens . this my lens choice majority my current shooting situations .	1
case made high quality material fits my canon powershot a700 perfectly . i would given it 5 stars if case seperate compartment carrying extra set batteries . there just enough room carry camera extra memory chip . no extra batteries .	1
i am railfan , very large range zoom important . shooting fly distant bridge shot closeup coming around bend . focuses quickly too . i canon 10d i hate changing lenses because it gets dust inside camera . this 28-200mm very practical my hobby , gets used waterfall other outdoor scenery too . one note interest , it hard get super-sharp background details this lens , compared any lenses or series lenses , ( buddy i shot same closeup shot ore dock way background dock details looked lot sharper his 28-135 lens ) . same camera , same settings . closeup focused object looked great both , just when looking out-of-focus objects , lenses seemed better . this lens worth price my opinion , superb amateurs hobby-photographers like myself . but those looking touch more distant details out focused field , 28-135 usm lens canon seems little step ahead this . series lenses , course , league their own	1
this lens extremely fast ( quiet ) focus , razor sharp . what more could you want , when photographing wildlife up close	1
ive it couple months now . i notice no difference it my canon bp511 . my only gripe it its cheazy silver plastic color , but hey , who looks your batteries	1
battery works great , shipping amazon took too long . i purchased other items same day other retailers they delivered 5 days sooner than amazon item	1
i've only this lens few days i say it impressed me . it drawbacks , needs lots light somewhat heavy . i would not like carry all day , but my need it isn't problem . i couple photos display taken first day i purchased lens . it very overcast day i think they turned out reasonable weather . my test home when sun popped out outstanding . push pull adjustment i see no problem it . i think little more experience it very good purchase my budget . i know there higher quality lens but price becomes issue , when you amature hobbiest like i am . i would recommend any one who likes take wildlife photos . 5 star rating money quality it very good lens !	1
i've using these rebel xt since two weeks . friday i went show local bar took 600 shots medium low light conditions ( just small stage lights lighting up band ) finally killed battery after 2 1/2 hours/600 shots	1
i like color . it fits camera perfectly . it really cute not bulky . it not just ordinary black camera case everyone else . it classy	1
this item great .... i love it ... i my 35 mm digital camera it everything else i need ..	1

this timer/cable release lot features . works well . cord somewhat short though , it cheap plastic construction . hard imaging it costs this much . i think it over priced . but it job .	1
i originally bought brand blower clean my digital camera , but after using it once i ended up introducing more dirt and/or rubber bits than i care remember . long story short i don't use my camera anymore it took me long time get all crud out my camera . but then i decided give brand try since so many people seemed able use blower bulbs without any problems . when i got my new blower my sensor already fairly clean , but after using it it little cleaner . you still sometimes those stuck particles ( i use sterile pec pads eclipse solution get rid those pretty good results , but this your own risk since it voids most camera manufacturers warranties . ) i also keep my blower original packaging keep it clean possible , i guess i am little gun shy after my first experience	1
i got this camera my 17th birthday last summer , it great . much i'd love canon powershot , it bit out my price range . all people who think using lcd screen runs out batteries after quot ; 2-4 picturesquot ; lying you . i bought rechargable batteries radioshack , i've taken up 400 picture without batteries needing changed . this good camera good quality good lighting . dark or overcast situations , it look bit grainy , but that easily photoshopped . i recommend when uploading , plug it into wall digital camera adapter , because uploading sucks all battery power right out . i recommend this someone who hasn't owned digital camera before , or someone wants good quality not-so-crazy price	1
i am portrait professional photographer over 40 years . i needed wide angle lens weddings wanted know quality kit lens . i test using rebel xt kit lens canon 16-35mm lens which costs somewhere around $ 1,500 . i set both cameras 18mm focal length tripod . i took shots outdoors indoors . images exactly same . outdoor shots show objects infinity well 10 ' away . i made 8x10 prints showed them my fellow professional photographers . nobody could identify which lens took which . this real world scenario	1
this great camera those who need more than point shoot but not want carry bag full lenses . also , large sd card ( 1 4 gb ) this camera replace your video camera . one thing note , when you take pictures while recording video , it stops recording second or two while it processes your picture . this very obvious when watching your video	1
i'm still learning use this camera all features . so far it amazing . i've taking pictures kids it looks like pro shots . i use auto mode lot it works great . zoom amazing . i love it tells me when i am focused . also it great battery life . i'm very happy this camera	1
this lens so many uses . anytime i position myself where my subject more than five feet away , this my lens choice . i kit 18-70mm came d70 50mm prime ( i 18-200 vr order , if nikon ever get around catching up demand , lens might surpass this one , due smaller weight - plus it lot cheaper ) . i took every lens i own d70 british museum london . shooting handheld available light ( i never used flash ) many egyptian greek artifacts over fifty feet away , i got outstanding results this lens . vr technology amazing . constant 2.8 aperture also major advantage . i'll grant you my arm felt like rubber hose after four hours site seeing , but it worth it ! i similar satisfaction using lens outdoors wildlife photography . i even used tc-20eii teleconverter lens , shoot hummingbirds great distance . i would no reservations recommending lens , until nikon announced 18-200 vr . this new lens much broader focal length low end , focuses much closer ( around foot , compared five feet 70-200 ) . 18-200 not provide constant 2.8 aperture across it focal length , so 70-200 would better long distances low light . but less than half price , i think less than half size , this new lens clearly premier spot my bag . it totally replace 70-200vr ? i'll update my review when i finally get try lens block . until then , 70-200mm vr champ	1
i nikon d50 , when attaching camera , tilting base tripod needs little compensation camera weight . hence , i haven't found any use libelle tripod . i look through wiev finder see if my set-up level or not . overall though , it not big problem , hey , price tripod , i'll live it	1
this tool transforms my drebel xt tiny little viewfinder into usable one . it 1.25 setting it shows clear picture 100% coverage what viewfinder shows . 2.5 , coverage much less but setting very handy very critical manual focussing jobs . remember set your camera diopter it default factory setting . otherwise , flipping angle finder 1.25 2.5 magnification requires re-adjustment finder diopter . big advantage this little device it gives you freedom try exciting angles ( hey , they don't call it angle finder nothing ) without breaking your neck . only minor downside initial learning curve getting adjusted image shown finder .	1
i tokina 12-24 f4 it great sharp lens . this canon focuses faster wider . if you're worried full frame future don't . just buy this lens enjoy ultra wide images . it light , fast sharp . " " quality pictures . build could better but i don't see any problems down road .	1
i got this lens because i didn't really own anything close this range except kit lens ( good but not great not f/ 2.8 ) . i own 15mm canon fisheye but it distort quite bit even 20d i don't like correct photoshop each time i wanted wide lens . i wanted something wider , could capture lots light ( i allot ambient low light photowork ) i wanted something versatile ( 20d this really 24mm 56mm --- great working range ) . pros : 1 ) 1.6 crop factor my 20d this really 24 56mm lens . this makes it quite bit less wide angle more midrange lens . consequently , it stays my camera all time covers most my daily needs . i bought this lens fully expecting it 24 56 i wanted it multi purpose 24mm its still pretty wide . 2 ) i try avoid flash much possible given type photography i f/ 2.8 i take some great ambient light pictures i would not able otherwise3 ) f/ 2.8 , i also blow backgrounds foregrounds out focus . out focus areas gorgeously buttery blokeh very nice given 7 blades shutter . 4 ) color saturation like nothing i've ever seen before except my 70-200mm canon " " . i literally floored some baby pictures i took where colors two words " mind blowing " . i knew color would great but " wow ! " photoshop cs2 i " fake " saturation but its just not quite same color came out this lens straight out box . zero photoshop touchup needed . 5 ) its sharp ! this lens takes some amazingly sharp pictures into what i would classify amazing . i've received numerous positive comments sharpness this lens . i've tried looking edges see if there any ca or less sharpness couldn't really find any . maybe full size sensor you tell more but i couldn't really 20d . i notice plane focus f/ 2.8 narrow ( which good ) i make sure everything i want focus . blokeh very buttery f/ 2.8 . i like it quite bit . 6 ) its built like tank . black metal shell . metal ef mount . smooth manual focusing . sturdy recessed switches . red stripe catches eye photographers who know .... easy strike up conversations learn . 7 ) it surprisingly smaller lighter than i thought it would . half size my 70-200mm canon " " . i expecting it bigger am much happier it wasn't . its my camera all time not chore carry around all . unless you're very petite person . 8 ) internal focusing . so lens size doesn't change size or turn when focusing . this very useful when you put filters or when you're focusing close . 9 ) usm motor . its whisper quiet it focuses super fast . faster than my 70-200mm .... something i'd expect but wow its fast silent . 10 ) it focuses pretty close 12 inches or so . you get close your subject . its not macro lens but you get some dramatic wide angle shots its close focusing . 11 ) its ttl2 so works very nice my 580ex flash . 12 ) ef mount grow you . if you upgrade your camera body full frame camera ef mount , this lens fit your new camera you continue enjoy your lens investment . cons : 1 ) 1.6 frame size , it doesn't get into " amazing " wide category but that not fault lens . i'm marking this down con but you take it several ways . if you want get ultra-wide small frame camera , you won't this lens ( although 24mm pretty darn wide ) your only canon options 15mm fisheye which i own think great specialty lens , 10-22mm efs canon , 14mm . 10-22 i hear very good but its efs ( won't fit full frame cameras - less upgradable i think ) its not lens although non-l 10-22 i hear exceptional . 14mm ef run you almost much this 16-35mm zoom . 15mm ef fisheye wonderful but it designed distort distortion visible 20d even more so full frame cameras you need photoshop fix . this 16-35mm , if you want f/ 2.8 ok something like 24-56 , then you won't find better small-sensor cameras . i'm very glad i got it , if you already full frame camera or upgrade some point , you enjoy 16mm " wow " wide . i only imagine coverage i'd get full frame camera . 2 ) hood massive ... wide but not very deep ... so its shallow hood ( it wide angle i guess ) . i never take it off -- it keeps stray light out secondary protection lens . i zero problems lens flare . 3 ) front lens element sink out inside tube ( exposed but lens case doesn't change size ) . there no protective filter protect front element . i bought uv/haze filter ($26 amazon ) i highly recommend you well protect your investment . uv/haze filter , lens very self contained . 4 ) oh cost .... my oh my . expensive heck . cost much my camera body --- worth every penny . if its any consolation , these lenses very hard make they keep their value . your camera body might drop value new technology arrives but this lens hold its value if you take care it . differences , notes , things i've heard : 1 ) i no experience non canon lenses so i can't compare but this 16-35 amazing . 2 ) compared other " " lenses , it holds up quality amazing when it comes color , performance , lens construction . 3 ) i hear there some chromatic aberation edges these wide lenses ( well more than 70-200mm ) but that expected when you're gathering light such wide angles focusing it .... that got hard . wide angles exhibit more ca than long telephotos . my 16-35mm it wasn't visible me . i imagine pro pro might notice care . anybody less stringent requirements than pro pro or extremely saavy person , couldn't even notice or care . besides , ca this lens orders magnitude less than almost any other lens . 4 ) i bought directly amazon . ordered monday got lens next day tuesday . amazing service . great store .	1
since there tons rave reviews features this camera , i won't bother you details . instead , i tell you one huge letdown this camera likes ( rebel , 20d ): 1.6 focal length factor . this means my dear 28-105 lens now sorry 45-170 . recoup loss i'd spend $700 17-40 4.0 lens . this consequence using small ccd . cameras like 1d full-size 35mm ccd sell over $ 4,000 . i cannot wait price go down . i also cannot help wonder whether focal reading speedlite flashes correct ( i own 540ez discovered dismay it doesn't work these cameras ) . i look my a2 ( still infatuated it ) i wonder if i right thing . i think i keep it around while , just case ..	1
i am not most experienced photographer , but this camera takes terrific pictures , my opinion . nice big lcd screen touch screen great feature	1
i gave this my wife her birthday , so far no complaints all . camera plenty functions you play , but it also work point shoot situations . good quality pictures , it looks feels top notch	1
if your camera spends any amount time connected your computer -- either copying pictures , or using remote capture program -- you should this ac adapter . it also obviously handy if you lot shooting fixed location -- instance : tripod . adaptor ingenious little contraption . there normal ac line runs power adapter , but instead running dc output dedicated jack camera body , connector shape normal battery pack . if you look closely your camera , you see little grove bottom battery compartment providing enough room wire exit . now surprise . i'm planning trip europe . i knew battery charger came camera , this ac adapter both support 100-240 volts ac , 50-60 hz input . which covers all worlds power supplies . but battery charger included camera only came us power cord . i've looking various european cords would fit charger so i could keep my batteries topped off overseas . what should i find when i open box this adaptor ? complete collection all worlds cords , which also happen fit charger . what win , now i run my camera ac , stay charged while i'm vacation	1
nikon d50 absolutely fantastic camera . if you moving point shoot , you jump completely new leage photography . pros : 1 . noise extremely low iso 800 , highly usable 1600.2 . camera control good , you get 2.5 frame per second , more than enough non-professionals . 3 . flash sync 1/500 sec , one best market . 4 . image quality ( iq ) excellent . cons : 1 . lcd screen small . 2 . top lcd no back light . 3 . no depth field review button . regards , csoura	1
i rated accessory kit 3 well . gave kit 3 3 star . i gave kit 2 my mom who just got sd550 . great camera what i tell . this kit however needs major improvements . going best kit 2 , worst it , we starting review battery pack . battery ... uhhh , not much say here . spare battery use hot spare out there if your running low after taking too many shots . mine kit 3 great i still use it this day . i swap active battery each time i charge . this what gave this product many stars i given it . final decision ( battery ): wonderfulneck strap ... ( taken kit 3 added improvements)if your moving around this thing way long or way short . it too short strap across you chest . it way long because if it hangs front you , your precious camera you just paid couple few hundred now freely bouncing around . not good . my mom really short this just too short her use well . not much bouncing issue me but still not useful enough her . her comment , " this strap either too short or too long . doesn't fit me all . " cracks me up because i never told her my personal opinion matter she came up same results . final decision ( neck strap ): use it jump drive you use often or anything else . just not your precious camera . case ... they screwed up kit 3 , this kit still screwed up ( managed even worse than kit 3 ) . velcro fine most usage so i can't knock . belt clip fine dandy . case pretty darn good keeping camera safe outside elements harm . hole center useless heck just like kit 3 ( mom came same conclusion ) . here where they really screwed up . stitching this case worse than kit 3 . kit 3 , you only worry stitching screwing up your screen back case . this case , you stiching back front . unlike kit 3 which magnetic clasp where stitching or any attachment case hidden behind soft cloth , this one velcro stitching inside front . belt clasp stiching other side . no escape this kit . i highly advise you get screen protector if using this case . poor design shame people who manufacture this case . final decision ( case ): " move people ... nothing see here . " seriously ... don't bother using this case without screen protector . complete decision : i wouldn't buy this kit again all . it great there extra battery but i don't think anything else worth penny more this kit . better off buying everything seprate . going lower my rating 2 stars	-1
i extremely impressed this camera ; i felt only not exceptional feature its nonwithstanding aptitude steady shots . other than , i felt it fantastic , exceeded all expectations	1
it looks good takes great pics ease use good film camer	1
filters just expected . high enough quality optics price , one better deals consumers looking enjoy range photo they give you . great value . just try find something comparable without spending ton more cash	1
i bought this camera ( canon a460 ) second camera looking pocket-sized , compact , digital camera zoom video capabilities , took aa batteries priced reasonably cheap [ ... ] canon powershot a460 all . it small enough fit into your palm fits into front pants pocket easily light enough camera not really noticeable after few minutes . it seems me canon designed it carried without camera case because there lens shield pulls into place cover lens whenever it powered off . ( lens retracts into camera body when it powered off , lens cover pulls into place automatically ) . body well rounded no sharp edges anywhere might catch parts clothing . lcd screen exposed but i pasted one those see-thru lcd screen plastic protectors ( sticky one side ) it protect it scratches . all camera openings well protected covers . only cover i thought little more play than it should battery cover . camera powers up extremely quickly . you focus either viewfinder or lcd screen . one thing surprised me when using viewfinder , there no information shown viewfinder other than green light indicate camera focus or blinking orange light indicate it not . lcd mode shows lot more info ( eg , iso speed , current resolution , etc ) . but , i guess it makes sense since this camera meant simple , what could simpler than knowing when something focus or not . that pretty much all info that needed . ( switching viewfinder conserve battery power ) . i bought 2gb kingston secure digital card $13 amazon this camera so there plenty space . card removed put into sd card reader comes most modern computers laptops . ( my laptop , toshiba tecra a5 it , it bought 2 years ago ) . computer recognize sd memory card extra drive , transfer rate extremely fast . if your computer not sd card reader , then usb connector used transfer images your computer instead . video mode , zoom works only when highest video resolution ( 640 480 ) . ( this surprise me too . my canon powershot s1 , zoom works all video resolutions ) . video little more choppy compared canon s1 . there no dedicated zoom lever . two buttons normally used menu navigation also serve zoom controls . ( canon s1 ( my other camera ) dedicated zoom lever , which nice ) . i guess , one reasons reusing buttons zooming more compact design -- no lever sticking out might catch your clothing ) . once i got used it , i not any problems using 2 buttons zooming . pictures taken usual canon quality . you pay attention make sure your hands not shaking when you press shutter since there no image stabilizer ( i've gotten spoilt canon powershot s1 which image stabilizer ) . [ ... ] buttons camera designed placed so you could operate camera only right hand if so desired . left hand used just stabilize steady camera . this camera uses focus beam light helps it focus quickly much lauded digic ii processor . both technological improvements over canon powershot s1 which not autofocus light only digic i processor . camera uses aa batteries ( either rechargable or normal type work ) . easily available power important feature me . i very pleased super macro capability this camera , which allows extreme close ups . access this mode , you set camera " " ( manual mode ) dial , then press func/set button . this open up menu where you set camera " super macro " . [ ... ] this camera ( canon a460 ) " scn " mode which you choose different scenes ( portrait , night , kids , pets , indoors , foliage , snow , beach ) . i've used " snow " scene setting my pictures came out great when i'm skiing taking pictures . ( access scene setting , turn dial " scn " then press func/set button , which bring up menu allows you choose settings ) . i'm really enjoying canon a460 it filled its role my camera arsenal admirably . i needed camera i could take me when i'm skiing or snowboarding light small cheap . it fits into my pants pocket pretty light it not interfere my balance , etc . ( canon s1 , though great camera , little too large fit into my pants pocket or fanny pack . however , it still my preferred camera when i'm able camera case or back pack me . ) update ( 4/11/2007)--i've this camera 2 months now accidentally dropped it twice 2 3 feet onto hard surface floor . also , dropped it into foot snow while skiing using video . camera still working flawlessly .	1
first off , let me make it clear i am satisfied this camera . i it 8 months now i put it through its paces its held up fine . but there few things you must know : camera no zoom . i mean , practically no zoom . 2.2 may look decent but its pointless any real-life situation . you find yourself moving lot your camera get better shot , not standing one place using zoom feature . you never get close wide shot - its just not possible this camera . this camera great average stills but that it . you click twice take picture or " press halfway then fully " according manual . this major pain . sometimes when battery weak , it may take lot time take picture ( lot frustration ) , so this not cam capture any special pictures or " kodak moments " . apart these cons , camera great value money offers video all kinds stuff . if you're looking mostly looking take landscape or portrait stills , this camera good job	1
video camera without light like still camera without flash -- if your sony camcorder doesn't come light built , you need this ! couple notes : this light much smaller than i'd expected -- it only 1 " across front 1.5 " high 1.5 " deep . it doesn't sound like much , but it puts out remarkable amount light , enough illuminate out your subject even , warm light , even nearly 10 ' away . reason i can't give it 5 stars : it puts out lot heat , it cut your battery life half ( i've got hdr-sr1 ) . both these issues would readily addressed sony providing led version this light , but until they , i don't think any other accessory could possibly give your videos bang-for-buck this one	1
excellent camera . i digital rebel xl wanted smaller high quality camera hiking , etc . i am very pleased . it not slick rebel smaller lens not match - but shots more than adequate . it few very sweet aspects - one wysiwyg aspect half shutter depression - very good questionable lighting situation which i tend find myself . slight advantage too , works well . overall i am pleased	1
compartments range open areas camera accessories . also netted areas extra cd , remote , etc . good look extra carrying straps , included	1
i purchased olympus 720 my daughter christmas time because we all scuba divers family there housing option well able go 10ft without housing . we recently went bonaire both camera housing worked well considering she not strobe . she able capture little squid night dive just camera housing . i highly recomend ease use quality constrction housing also took beating surf . great those us wish point click lot lighter smaller than my ikelite	1
camera works great . it easy use , takes wonderfull pictures . image quality very nice , range focal length great too . i two issues it . it not perform well low light situations(inside dark rooms ) it tough autofocus . also , it goes through batteries like crazy . i would recomend getting set rechargable batteries , it well worth it after 3 or 4 days using camera all day	1
this my first digital camera so i can't compare others . however , i'm not someone who needs top line model , i thought price could not beat . i found controls fairly easy learn " quickstart " guide came camera . downloading computer also simple . i not try software which came camera i not deem it necessary transfer photos my computer . if you use windows xp it automatically detect camera . ( other reviewers believe software not up par however ) . i took many photos highest megapixel setting ( average picture 1.4 mb ) so they could printed out ( no larger than 4x6 prints recommended ) . if larger prints important , higher mexapixel camera might order . viewing online-only , lowest setting looks very good . it compact size means it fits comfortably small bag weighs nothing . recommended you purchase camera case separately well nimh battery charger . also , purchased 1g memory card separately . flash take while recharge shots , but this not problem me	1
i am accustomed using larger point shoot zoom . this sleek pocket sized point shoot gives exceptionally sharp pictures . it focuses very swiftly i would suppose due leica lense . battery life good . i notice photos tend calibrate little blue range . i like little more zoom . overall , i like it very much	1
i recently purchased this product replace my li-10b battery my olympus camedia camera . it seems hold charge better than original battery ever works well camera . i've only using it several weeks so only time tell how well it lasts	1
i love vista frame so much , i've just ordered 3 more family gifts . all original problems listed reviews fixed manufacturer . if frame goes into sleep mode ( overnight when no motion sensed ) , it wakes up goes right back into slideshow mode without restart menu buttons . color great photos viewable all angles . i haven't experienced any flickering problems . my digital camera allows me upload photos my pc hardrive onto compact flash card so i able create cards different groups pictures different family members . this digital frame would make excellent gift	1
people love macro photography , this item must . great definition , detail sharp image result you gonna get this lens . able play dimension focusing part element or object background out focus , it super ! if you undecided , go it ! i guarantee professional results	1
lot people talking issues delay after you take pic . flash , but it really only bothers me if i'm big rush . so you might not wanna get this camera if your either realllly impatient or just always big rush ! people also mentioned pictures always blurry . i never get blurry pictures except when i'm not using flash . pictures usually come out great ! red-eye remover works pretty good this camera , but night visions stuff dont really work , but if its dark you just use flash . i love this camera ! i would deffinitley reccomend rechargable batteries because this camera eats them up pretty quickly but rechargable ones last long time ! hope this helped !	1
i purchased 3 these christmas presents 3 teenagers my home . cameras very well received . kids loved them recorded took photos everything under sun ! they b-l-a-s-t these ! however , before year up , door holds batteries camera broke every single one them ( i purchased 3 -- that over $300 down tubes ) , even " mild child " . too bad construction wasn't better :o	-1
items deilivered very fast ( 3 days instead 5 9 days stated	1
pros : 1 . great video quality good great light . colors " punchy " . 2 . doubles still camera . even though still quality not great , it could still come handy . 3 . down-conversion standard definition seems pretty good . easily record hi-def dvd using down-converted digital connection camera dvd recorder . 4 . handling seems good . size camera fairly small . it amazing what they pack into things this size . 5 . uses hdv format minidv tapes . cons : 1 . usb interface not usb 2.0 ! this 2007 ! downloading still photos takes much longer than it should . i don't intend buy proprietary memory card reader . 2 . uses sony proprietary memory . 3 . still camera functions mediocre . probably equivalent today $200 less digital still cameras . i canon 20d digital slr difference quite clear ! sony still photos noisier just not good looking . flash photos low light poor fair . 4 . don't like menu system . seems harder use than it should . neutrals : 1 . fair battery life included battery . 2 . video quality low-light could better , but it not poor . i'd say it fair . 3 . audio good but it picks up camera motor noise bit annoying . it mic jack though	1
this good solid camera if you use it well it provide you good pictures . it bit heavy compared other digital compact cameras but it solid functional . easy menu good lens	1
i just got this last week quality photos excellent ! videos really good well ! no complaints so far . this perfect point-and-shoot folks but then camera features whole lot more if you want get creative . just careful buying sd cards larger than 2gb , but just make sure sd card ' sdhc ' stamped it . i made mistake buying regular 4gb sd card it not work camera . good thing sd card worked my nikon d50 . live learn	1
no need convert anymore . you just hook up usb cable drag clips camcorder comoputer . save lots time	1
this easy thing use u print your pictures no problem easy replace ink paper	1
strengths : 1 . great price . 2 . very good picture quality . 3 . excellent low light capabilities . 4 . excellent auto-focus . 5 . excellent zoom range control . 6 . small light . 7 . small compact . weaknesses : 1 . ok , internal mic . low audio output . 2 . no true 16x9 mode . 16x9 squeeze mode reduces quality . summary : i used this camera three shoots so far it continues surprise impress me . money its excellent deal . image quality comparable its big brother ag-dvx100 . didn't think night modes would usefull but they produce some very artistic shots bw . my only disappointment no true 16x9 mode . 16x9 modes they reduces image quality noticably . i would definitely recommend external mic . i use rode video mic ... very sensitive but comparable more expensive shotguns . also , wide angle lens must . raynox hd-6600 excellent lens price it produces great soft focus effect long end zoom range . also libec zoom controller works great camera creative shots check out new manfrotto fig rig .	1
while i've used other peoples digital cameras before , i never one my own until now . i'm very happy i read most reviews e900 purchased it . i've owned used it since first year i haven't tested all features yet but i very happy it so far .	1
i olympus 770 sw ( not 720 sw ) , sure ... i like it . i five digital cameras before , this one terrific . considering it sub-compact pocket camera , image quality fine ( not equal digital slr , but i don't want carry around big box like dslr ) . shadow detail especially impressive . operation smooth intuitive . screen fine , even outdoors . shutter lag , big concern mine i like photograph my kids sports , minimal zero if you prefocus . number custom scene settings impressive . i bought it because waterproofing shockproofing , because prior good experience olympus over years , but i'm just happy pictures it takes under normal circumstances too . few gripes stop me giving camera 5 stars : 1 . battery cannot recharged when it camera . total $80 or so , you get external power source cable , together they let camera run long time without draining battery , but they don't charge battery . battery life fine day normal shooting , but if you use camera actively , every single night you pretty much unlock case , take out battery charge it , then remember put battery back next day . each charge takes 5 hours . i'm going take same $80 instead buy two extra batteries comfortable -- one camera , one reserve me , charging home . even so , it take some planning thinking keep batteries ready all time vacation . it would much nicer holster or charging socket case . 2 . case actually smaller than it needs . it could significantly bigger still fit my shirt pocket , which my standard size requirement . it , advanced engineering impressive pack all features tiny box , but camera more expensive than need , lens smaller than it should ( depending zoom position , lens f/ 3.5 f/ 5.0 , which pretty weak ) , it harder hold camera than need , if case bigger , there would room nice little charging socket too . 3 . there indeed background , almost mechanical noise introduced when filming videos . it probably filtered out , it very constant very low pitched , but it mildly annoying . 4 . time shots too long -- it takes several seconds save each shot full resolution . 5 . you use internal memory only if there no memory card slot . given slow transfer speed card , it sure would nice able save dozen or so shots very quickly internal memory then transfer them memory when you time . all , though , i'm really looking forward using this camera forthcoming sea kayaking snorkeling trip this summer . one camera , i'll able take snapshots above below water , also modest videos underwater ( there special scene selection just )	1
great product , even better price !! i'm thrilled quality ease use . i love it ! great birding , recommend very highly !!	1

i bought these my boyfriend so he could use them watch everything shore birds stars , they perfect . this great product , you see anything these binoculars focusing very easy . take little getting used weight , but they great , much more flexible alternative telescope , so price	1
i get bandwagon here . this superb little camera , definately five stars ! i also tz1 , which showed promise , but limitations . my review tz1 , i noted it lots " noise " pictures shouldn't printed much beyond 4x6 inches if they sharp . i also wanted more manual controls . tz3 fixes improves almost everything tz1 adds some new , very useful features . noise drastically reduced , lens better , sensor bigger , processor not only faster , but produces better pictures . tz3 adds very handy " function " button - or i should say function capability - number buttons same - which gives immediate access five or so " most used " settings without go into menues - which there several . tz3 keeps mega optical image stabilization adds intelligent iso , increases sensitivity without adding noise , ( i not tried 3200 setting yet . ) , increases size viewing screen , etc ., etc . tz3 " well-rounded , " very capable camera . there simply no comparison tz1 tz3 far quality pictures . tz3 wins hands down . my opinion it also beats some big name , higher priced digicams - couple which i own - rather handily . course , big selling point tz3 still 10x lens - now wide angle capability - pocket-sized point shoot camera . this lens sharp , combined larger sensor new processor yields some excellent results . while there no manual controls , per se , camera seems very well without them . pictures sharp , exposures seem nicely ( haven't tried it night yet , but low light forrest shots excellent ) , colors accurate , appropriately saturated , vivid ( ok . i like vivid setting . ) , good contrast , etc . there variety af settings , settable focal points , focus modes . there also exposure compensation , exposure bracketing available - they work well ! live histogram welcome bonus . tz3 focuses down 2 inches macro mode - again excellent , sharp results . tz3 very well speced out . one nice thing gone lens cap tz1 . it really not inconvenient , but seemed always swinging wind add yet source camera shake . tz3 lens includes built lens cover . very welcome . i currently own five top flight digicams ( including this one ) , owned many others , i am most impressed this one - combined convenience results . it quantum step forward . i also couple quite nice , fairly complete dslr kits . they wonderful , class themselves , but when i want very nice pictures convenience pocketable point shoot 10x , wide angle lens , or back up dslrs , tz3 now my camera choice .	1

i won't comment camcorder itself . it great , it fulfills all needs i . only problem came when i upgraded my computer ( i forced , not voluntary move ) vista . not single item bundled software compatible vista , starting usb driver . april 24th , panasonic doesn't even provide eta delivery upgraded drivers . just remember it before you purchase it . piece hardware over $1000 , you expect full functionality your environment	1
same battery came w/ my canon sd550 . works great , never problem	1
perfect fit my sd500 cheapest one i found internet .	1
this camcorder bought september 2005 still working well . i talking film class didn't want hassle borrowing my school $1000+ camcorder . knowing full well canon sony , especially sony , would best camcorder people wanting their shots look professional , i looked amazon circuit city see reviews . i went into stereo advantage well , walked out jvc due fact it little less expensive then some other camcorders . so , advantages disadvantages : advantages : 1 ) it pretty decent low light . it light it this help . 2 ) i never noticed motor noise mostly because when i film stuff edit it my powerbook final cut , i usually add music . i read reviews motor noises but i guess if there complete silence room , you'll hear it . 3 ) firewire cable av cables easy find connect . 4 ) easy hold . disadvantages : 1 ) firewire not come camcorder . you'll buy this separate . best place find firewire cables online ( amazon , ebay ) . you'll play way too much stores . ** way , if you don't know what firewire here what it . mac computers almost always come firewire outlet , just like pcs come usb outlets . pcs , you buy firewire card insert it your pc . purpose firewire transfer video your camcorder onto your computer . usb plugs(which comes this camcorder ) just transfer photos . 2 ) taking pictures this camcorder not turn out good all . i would stick digital camera instead . 3 ) battery horrible . it lasts like 50 minutes fully charged . i plan buying one .	1
i bit concerned buying " aftermarket " equivalent but i very wrong . this battery performs 100% like canon brand . you won't dissappointed	1

this battery definitely good buy . it last long time ...	1
i see no difference all my original panasonic battery one lenmar . excellent price/value ratio	1
i think it great amazon carrying this product . price right this great solution hiding a/v components . i used it my wow ! cable box behind my wall , mounted eye just below my bose center channel speaker . i 42 " panasonic plasma display , mounting eye behind display not work recommended . it needs clear sight remote control when use . i also purchased terk leapfrog radio shack version leapfrog , they both horrible . i looking wireless solution this not way go . these products also worked , but range not advertised quite poor ( less than 5 feet away my remote control ) . i highly recommend microsmith do-it-yourselfer	1
my wife i went our first cruise i wanted camera would take video still pictures . after wearing out internet , i finally selected panasonic pv-gs150 . i amazed number passengers board same camera ! i couldn't happier results this camera . color reproduction fantastic ! i used it alot different applications such ; daylight , night shots , even sunsets . it great job ! still shots ok . more light you better picture . flash awesome ! so many digital cameras weak flash compared this camera . but keep mind your priorities . my first priority video , then still shots . i don't think you disappointed	1
we used fuji their menus so no intuitive all . i think kodak line best menus sony cameras best lcds . but overall picture quality go canon line . we sd400 there no complaints all . menus easy follow lcd little smaller than we wanted , but it still takes great picture . color swap feature cool advantage	1
great little camera . i also dmc-fz30 , this one almost many features much smaller , less expensive camera . hard beat	1
i tried digital . i really . but i could never get really gorgeous shots i got my old yashica slr which gave up ghost several years back . i also could not really " focus " what i shooting ... just pointed shot because there no film run out . result ? pointless pics weren't even good looking . digital just didn't feel " right . " so 8 months ago i decided go back film . what get ? after much research , i finally decided canon t2 . absolutely brilliant camera . my favorite feature ? i let camera handle focus , etc . or i go completely manual . may not seem like big deal , but it feels so good control what camera when you want . course , means letting your imagination go ... something sorely lacking digital . couldn't happier no more pointless pics . okay , maybe few , but they still look good . isn't point	1
i am very pleased this camera .... i yet use it 10 feet under water but maybe someday ... i love compact durability this camera . picture quailty excellent !!! very happy photographer	1
first one i got amazon wouldn't hold charge , but they sent replacement within couple days no hassle or grief ! yay amazon111the unit exactly what it supposed , so reasonable clarity . keep mind pictures relatively small , so closer you take picture better you able see it screen . make sure your focus money you not disappointed . great way show off children grandchildren	1
actually this not any perticular camera i want . i just bought it because average customer rating five star this only cool camera i could afford . i still like it , because this my very first own camera . i've even ask accsesories my birthday ! few scratches , but that only because i made them . when i put battery , everything fuctioned normally , even though i no film . least buy olympus camera	1
i've seen some bad digital frames- ones stretch out picture , making everyone look fat , or dim displays bad color . philips frame absolutely opposite : it delightfully easy use picture quality great . pictures automatically sized , cropped , even rotated when you turn frame . i didn't need software they included . i just dumped pile pictures cf card ( using my camera wired computer ) then plugged card into frame . menus frame navigated little joystick back . it not nicest menu system , but i got hang it pretty quickly . if you buying this grandma ( course ) here tip : buy two memory cards so you switch photo albums when you visit	1
we received closeup lens without problem . installs perfectly connector our sony camera . it everything we wanted , very simple effective , although one move camera bit focus function camera get perfect image	1
works great ; lets me recharge my casio camera without use dock which really important when i'm traveling . quick recharge time deep cycling battery . recommended .	1
this camera great . it small sleek , fits your pocket , looks nice too . it turns extremely quickly , snaps pictures faster then any other digital camera i've seen . if you're looking camera thats ready shoot moments notice , this one you . it variety preset modes various conditions , most them work fairly well . battery life decent , if you need more you purchase additional batteries only ten dollars amazon . it uses standard sd memory card which very low cost , comparison other typed memory cards . far cons go , only one occasionally pictures come out darker then you would like when using auto mode . this tends happen occasionally indoors , fixed choosing appropriate mode . however this occurrence rare , easily made up speed camera takes pictures . thing i found strange fact default , auto focus assist light constantly when taking video , leaving green light center video you shoot . however , this turned off options menu . overall , this my opinion best camera you get this price range	1
i bought three batteries , they all good state . i once bought rather cheap batteries ebay . they all made china , terrible . they didn't last five shots . but this time they original japan made works great .	1
i've purchased other bags but this one beats all it great price	1
very clear , bright day , strong magnification quality seems good . very well priced around $100.00 . i know more over passage time . my firstimpression good mj schra	1
i just received my camera 2 days ago immediately i began test it . it very nice it feels very nice hold . i like zoom stops when it reaches maximum optical zoom ( if you keep pressed 1 second it go digital zoom ) . battery last more than 200 shots which not bad all . it charges less than 2 hours . quality pics excellent . please read manual so you obtain professional photos	1
i've always kodak camera this one really nice . it takes crystal clear pictures i couldn't happier it . i haven't any problems using it am very pleased my purchase	1
lens adapter works fine . i think there should some link additional lenses ; it must purchase when you order optional lenses . i bought wide angle lens thinking it would fit camera , later discovering i should ordered adapter	1
this little camera great capturing wonderful moments my little boy growing up . i love i carry it my pocket or purse never miss anything . video quality awesome too ! i agree pp flash mess up some pictures subjects move after first flash , but it minor glitch . i'm so happy this camera . i've really enjoyed red-eye reduction mode camera . makes editing lot quicker	1
everything this camera amazing me . i originally read there problem this model camcorder screen blanking out after 1 or 2 years use . i haven't seen any signs happening so far . i love this . college kid it gets banged up occasion , but my sony seems held up challenge . buy this camcorder	1
this camera perfect people who record family events once or twice per year need things foolproof . this thing wonderful casual recording , though you'll definitely want multi-pack dvds , since limited time make changing discs constant event . you can't really edit these easily , but you could probably stitch bunch clips together make one long movie . only downside , other than basicness features , you occasionally hear dvd spinning . it kind wobbling sound , but it common lot dvd camcorders , i guess . so , if you're casual video jockey , teenage girl looking way make naughty videos her captain football team boyfriend , or lonely fat guy wanting make special show lady across street ... this camera you . if you want super video professional oliver stone movie director extraordinaire ? spend more money , you cheap goon	1
use this my bogen monopod . sofar so good . this i take vertical shot not limited just horizontal . very light easy use	1
i'm not sure any other reviewers gave this bad rating clue what they doing . 1 . li-on not memory , discharging them fully detrimental batteries life ! you should place them into charger before they discharge fully ! 2 . li-on light weight , not because cheap , but because they not contain heavy metals their construction . hey , if you need weight think it quality battery , buy nice lead acid lug around ! 3 . professionals waiting li-on make leap camcorders cameras ( but common form factor , like cr-v3 ) . li-on better than ni-mh , ni-mh better than ni-cad , ni-cad better than lead acid ... battery evolution . 4 . i'm not giving them 5 stars because i feel price they could better charge . 1200mah vs . 1500 or better . but i'm still getting much better performance over my old ni-mh , seemed lose it charge if left overnight camera . real bummer when trying complete shot limited light	1
i only used camera once date , but it simple use , small size great , large screen super , features great camera its price range , pictures good or better than i expected	1
i work professional photofinishing lab , i attest quality film inside this camera . kodak water sport camera provides excellent results both out water . it performs comparably kodak hq max versatility camera ; it produces high-quality image most situations . there no flash camera ( though using flash underwater produce unpredictable sometimes undesirable effects ) , so not plan using it low-light situations . film not like get wet , accidentally dropping your camera water could mean all pictures you just took lost forever . so even if you don't plan taking your camera physically underwater your family boating expedition , you might still want consider purchasing water sport camera insurance against " splash damage " . if you need flash , or if you plan take pictures depths greater than 50 feet , you'll need consider professional underwater camera or camera housing	1
i love size style this little camera bag . it only single compartment shoulder strap nice long . long enough use around waist fanny pack . bag itself isn't padded inside it rather stiff . tight fit my camera , but good protection i think . i just wanted keep my camera getting scratched up this trick nicely	1
adapter works easily , snapping off seconds . it large but very lightweight . my complaint this simply piece plastic which could not cost canon more than 10 cents . shame canon charging close $20 rather than including it camera free	1
there isn't too much you say this product because its just adapter . i ordered it my a520 it fits just fine i no problem attaching filters it .	1
i always slr photographer held off purchasing digital camera up until now because i not convinced resolution capabilities digital . i travel alot sometimes due space sometimes due desire inconspicuous i needed something smaller than my full size slrs . after lot research , looking every model i could find , i settled this panasonic lumix lx2 because i don't give up control over every aspect photo . this camera lets you control freak , or you leave it one several automatic modes . it store pictures raw mode , which important me ( canon g7 lost out because it didnt this ) but jpeg mode great . i blown up some prints this camera i am completely satisfied quality , i skeptical before , expecting underwhelmed . i originally bought this backup my slrs but i already see this my primary camera unless i am situation calls special lens , flash power , or super high resolution ( like 25 or 60 asa)my only suggestion panasonic would allow you charge battery while camera , like car charger , make some sort accomodation external flash . flash this camera weak spot - it really not bad size but if it could sync external flash would good	1
there 1000+ reviews this lens . i am going put my openions only : first , pros : 1 . versatile . 2 . effective vr . 3 . 11x zoom4 . sharp images . 5 . quick quit focus . cons : 1 . expensive . 2 . bit heavy . 3 . suffer some distortion . 4 . f/ 3.5 , i wish it 2.8 . overall , i am very happy this lens , if you like me , who carry only one lens everything , you not go wrong this lens	1
yeah , knobs may plastic , it may lightweight , but it works perfectly . it work well time lapse long you use shutter delay or remote(which you should anyway ) . it folds up very compact size you would more willing bring it you . i lost my shoe well , cant find replacement , so im buying new tripod . i paid good 40-50$ it 2 years ago local retailer , so 13$ what i hoping pay quick release shoe	1
if you looking cheap camera higher res . then here it . like i said , you get what you pay	1
this product what it says . i use camera adapter attach my canon eos-30d	1
this case works well camera , but elastic straps releasing flash significant design error . placing camera lens facing back case works much better . belt loop only measures 1.25 inches effectively , so it not work all belts . all all , case protect camera , which why i bought it	1
well this item amazing ... opinion every body should buy one them if you looking night vision monocular	1
i previously owned sd500 , looking better features such larger screen , wider zoon , higer iso speed , etc . found sd750 , i own it now . wow , it very nice design body , slimmer than sd500 . huge 3 " lcd screen , color display screen near original(not just my feel , also few other friends said so ) . use dial technology similiar ipod dial switch shoot modes , but you may take some time get used it . 3x optical 35-105mm zoom better than sd500 , but i wish it go wider 28mm like sd800 . sd750 digic iii processor . use sdhc card but i hear it may cause bottleneck , so i continue using 2gb highspeed hold over 600 pics highest setting . movie shooting great even inside restaurant night time . it also record your voice each picture . battary life not good sd500 . but it still takes 150 pictures full charge . recommend backup when you go traveling . no complaint 3 " lcd . oh , one good feature this camera it easy button review pictures , press shutter return shooting mode . this way better than sd500 . it one best so far . highly recommend if you looking compact , easy-use camera take quality pictures . good luck . added : this just my own preference , i silver version . i like this version better than black version , unless canon makes whole camera body black . feature i use this camera : i set folder created daily base , instead seeing picture property picture day , it groups all pictures took same day one folder	1
i recently ordered sony vct870rm tripod w/ remote my sony camcorder . it arrived few days i very pleased product . i'm glad i spent extra money variable zoom this model tripod plus it seems made little better then next lower model . i please purchase all around . nice job no complaints	1
camcorder very good quailty , but i find it some place cheaper bag , many other asserires . return very easy smooth , i thank you amazon.com maken ' happen ! i would order you again . a.m.h	1
i wanted good quality consumer grade digital camera take short trips , so i purchased this one . i think quality picures very good it most features i wanted . it few dollars more than i really wanted spend , but all all i am pleased . my main complaint battery life little short side , it takes while see photo you just took lcd screen . i really want something hold me two years , then these things twice good fraction cost . now it what i need it pretty well	1
i purchased kodak p20 zoom flash use my kodak p850 camera . money spent worth it i great results using this flash attachment ; , it easy use whether atuomatic or manual mode .	1
i came off canon powershot s40 , little 4-megapixel brick camera gave me 4 years excellent results . my first digital camera after closet-full film nikons . many buffs claim 4 megapixels all you need , i made number nice looking a3 prints . now i 7 megapixels work , i see i wrong : four not enough . seven wonderful . [ ... ] points out strongly above iso 200 noise real problem -- but you always wonder just how picky they . well not too picky this case . using higher than 200 setting ( i.e. , most indoor flash shots ) resulted lot noise , making camera almost unusable except simplest 4 6 snapshots . but i take almost entirely outdoor shots -- scenics candids . i set iso 100 get gorgeous results . it taken some getting used different color rendition tz3 my canon . canon seems more balanced while tz3 caused reddish orange really pop out . there something cool ( color temperature-wise , not " fashionable " ) color not entirely fixed photoshop . sometimes results marvelous , especially shots cloudy or rainy days . other times they not so grea t--t o desaturated my taste . so i playing around various settings --" natural " " vivid . " " vivid " closer what i want right out camera , but less easy spruce up . " natural " easier modify , so setting i am using now . i also set exposure compensation one stop under . i pleasantly surprised how small tz3 : it slips easily into pants pocket ( but not shirt pocket ) . zoom lens starting decent wide-angle ( 28mm ) utterly fantastic really makes camera stand out head shoulders pack . thus , i am delighted choice . however , answer my question " what more could i want ? " , here it : 1 . selection disk always moves when i pocket camera , so i always check , when i pull it out , reset it desired setting . its detents need strengthened . 2 . back-side controls too easy activate accidentally when shooting one-handed fleshy part thumb . headache because you then need press " select " get back operation . 3 . dpreview right when they moan venus iii sensor . it good but , otherwise sensational camera like this one , not good enough	1
i ordered battery charger friday night it monday or tuesday . charged little time . recorded video several times several pic . still haven't recharge yet	1
i bought this frame display pictures my newborn daughter my desk work . i didn't really high expectations it , because it so inexpensive . soon it turned i following problems : 1 ) five seconds after i turn it , it always says " usb connected ! " -- i don't usb cable inserted into it ! this also freezes device . i found way around this selecting memory card read within this initial 5 seconds or turning frame without any memory cards inserted . 2 ) i cannot copy files over it described pages 33-35 manual . my computer recognize usb device , but when i try copy files over frame , i get " path not found " error . 3 ) i thought i could live above 2 problems if it could just show my pictures . so i used card reader load . jpg files onto cf card 400x300 resolution . when , i plugged card into frame , these files show up " invalid " when i try view them . emailed coby 3 bullet points above , got response 30 hours later saying : " coby tech support me 5:25 am ( 3 hours ago ) hello , we received your inquiry . it appears your unit defective . return unit retailer exchange . " what inconvenience disappointment . i buying different product	-1
i mixed feelings this case . it pretty nice , but not exactly what i need or expected . it lot smaller than i envisioned . i just get my lumix fz50 it little charger , extra battery , cables , remote release . it 3 net pockets 1 zipper pocket , all tiny side . they big enough extra memory card or two , but not much more . i can't fit camera manual any them . it says " panasonic " front , not " lumix " like picture shows - not big deal . when i get couple conversion lenses ac adapter , i need something lot bigger . traveling light , this one handy , but it isn't complete transportation solution , any means	1
just took two week vacation , took my binoculars . binoculars very compact ( easy pack ) very clear view zoom feature stellar , saw mule deer using 8 power , 16 gave me closer view 24 gave me perfect rack view . all all , binoculars even better my purposes than i expected ) very satisfied !!!	1
after exhaustive research many lens , i finally decided plunk down $500+ ( time this written ) purchase this lens . it may not best market but it compliments my nikon 18-70mm dx lens nicely . i looking towards nikon 18-200mm dx lens , however ; price pushed me choose this one ( it nearly half price my two lens nearly cover all range one 18-200mm ) . quality/weight : build quality cheap yet sturdy ... plastic little chinky but cuts down weight . my nikon d200 no problem handling lens weight , however ; i heard ( unconfirmed ) reports this lens little heavy lighter cameras ( d80 , d70 , d40 , etc ) . ring connector metal rubber gasket outside so provide minor protection ( lens mount ) elements . you also keep this mind , when discussing weight , quality price ; bulk price this lens going into glass elements ( all 17 elements them ) . it gets expensive when you place many high-quality optics into tube . i'm really not surprised price , although $400 price-range would probably more suitable this lensfocusing/lens attributes : focusing quite fast ... times . you'll find , max 300mm focal range , lens pretty hard time auto-focusing subject . times it would focus pretty quick , 300mm range , while others it cannot focus all . you get around this quirk bringing subject into near focus ( manually ) then letting auto-focus take over ; it works every time . i find this focus problem disappointing especially given price this lens . quality bokeh ( out focus areas photograph ) very nice pleasing . images sharp , vignetting ( dark areas corner your photos ) hard find lens flare rarely problem . vibration stabilization : all i say it works ... it come handy . it not going stop image guaranteed you ; it only meant slow down rate which camera moves ( vibration holding ) . you notice difference ; it off you'll see image ( say 300mm ) really bouncing around ; then you flick vr . it takes sec or two but then image smooths out , it still wobbles around , but much more slowly . vr enabled , you usually go 2-3 ( sometimes 4 ) stops down , then what you'd normally able when hand holding . " shock " test : i haven't " shock tested " my lens yet ( ie dropped it ) but i heard ( again unconfirmed reports here ) it holds up pretty well drop ... although i would never recommend testing out . important note : 70-300mm range should noted : although lens states it 70-300mm zoom , this lens intended 35mm camera or full-frame ccd/cmos sensor digital camera . all ( or least majority ) nikon dslr ( d200 , d80 , etc ) not full-frame sensors . they approximately 1.5 factor full-frame sensor ( due smaller sensor size ) . what this all mean ? well it simple , since this 35mm lens not dx lens ( ie built account 1.5 factor most nikon digitals ) you apply 1.5 conversion . this means nikon 70-300mm nikon dslr give apparent zoom equivalent 105-450mm lens . i actually not mind this apparent zoom this should also cut down vignetting ; what lens projects onto sensor larger then area sensor itself . short : parts image spills over sensor , since this lens meant project onto full-frame sensor/35mm film . conclusion : pros : pleasing bokehfast auto-focus ( when working properly)vignetting minimalimage stabilization ( vr)flare minimal 1.5 factor ( 105-450mm ) makes nice zoomcolors very goodcons : plastic casingnear inability auto-focus 300mm rangeprice ( even though it cheaper then 18-200mm dx) 1.5 factor ( 105-450mm ) might make it more zoom then you needlens could faster ( f/4 would nice)i love this lens , even it quirks , however ; you may want wait till it drops price little more ( it falls almost bi-weekly ) . it may not fastest market , but it size , optics , image quality vr make this must lens serious nikon users !	1
this camera proved perform better than i expected . easy operate , yet so many bells whistles . there several tools capabilities come this camera , it very important read manual its entirety order maximize benefits . basics stuff it so good it might deceive you into thinking you got it all . its wide angle lens coupled high resolution excellent solution photographing my artwork further work my computer or reproductions/printing .	1
because its shirt-pocket size , this digital camcorder easy bring family outings such . i originally bought it because i plan attending my sister graduation didn't want bring plane both my very large semi-pro canon digital camcorder my digital still camera all its lenses . i took pure digital business trip plane just check it out it great fun . simple operate , results surprisingly sharp . only two drawbacks : 1 ) like any small device , could easy drop it , 2 ) it seemed like batteries getting kind low , boot-up time getting longer longer , after 40 or so minutes recording . i recorded 55 minutes , it still working . but , if you need quick capturing precious/important moments , might want carry spare set batterie	1
conversion lenses always poor reputation . typically generalizations like fuzzy , corner falloff so . panasonic dmw-lt55 tele conversion lens appears exception . mounted lumix fz50 , it produces images sharper than expected . not sharp those would produced nikkor or canon , but sharp detailed enough . there no noticeable falloff edges or corners . no vignetting either . contrast excellent . fz50 , lt55 used handheld camera optical image stabilization system activated . , frankly , astonishing . neat trick fz50 able reduce resolution image 10 megapixels down 3 megapixels ( just using center sensor ) effectively increasing power tele converter 1,137 mm lens . images aren't bad . converter lighweight easily attached fz50 . any filter lens must removed first . no adapter required . overall , fz50 nice knockaround travel camera . it light , incredible 12x leica design approved lens , 10 megapixel sensor just every feature you could want . adding lt55 your kit gives you extra-long telephoto you've always wanted carry without doing damage your back . neat product . jerry	1
if you'e looking replacement or extra battery your nikon digital camera , this one beats nikon original hands down . not only it significantly cheaper , but it greater capacity . nikon battery rated 650 mah . digital concepts battery rated 800 mah	1
this great camera - especially price . hp makes camera-computer interface software very user-friendly it takes great pictures well . it nice big lcd screen lithium-ion battery lasts long time me . i recommend this camera very highly	1
this bag lot bigger than i anticipated . it well constructed lot compartments put all your goodies . give you idea size , i am currently carrying :-d igital rebel xt slr-canon ae-1 program film slr-10 rolls film-extra battery charger-a few filters-lots various camera odds endsand i still tons room left ! i haven't even began max this bag out . i am very happy this buy extras come it .	1
i used canon powershot . i am happier color sony . it gives me true sunset color . it seems wider range color especially red zone . skin tone more real livelier	1
i purchased camera after my old one ( casio ex z-40 ) broken since i loved my old one very much i concerned if new one would good old one . it 10.000 times better ! automatic mode helps unexperienced photographers take great pictures . but using individual modes settings results even better . i tested camera any situation during 6000 mile roadtrip across american west it not disappoint me all . only thing bit annoying everytime you switch camera it automatically go snapshot mode you switch through different modes again adjust settings you need . but surely there way figure out how avoid , i'm probably just not patient enough find out how since all other models casio cameras i tested not show this problem . overall , i highly recommend camera all types photographers !	1
this remote works well , but new one needs manufactured , supports more functions e-300 e-500 cameras	1
this camera my eye roughly 3 years now now it finally my possession , i could not more pleased . previous owner canon optura 300 , i craving more professional camera very long time . my canon , while possibly one best 1-chip camera i ever used , far too small what i needed accomplish it . i craved more manual control , easier layout , more stable camera , full in-depth control over white balance focus . vx2100 fulfilled all these requirements spectacularly . i use this camera primarily filming skateboarding snowboarding videos short films it seemingly tailor made suit needs those who documents these sports . here short synopsis what makes each features this camera so fantastic . layout : this camera great layout . zoom focusing ring near front camera record button zoom rocker handle , dedicated audio white balance buttons back , everything easy find , well labeled , intuitive its placement . manual control : this camera some most indepth manual features nearly any prosumer camera market today . i stated before , this camera mostly button instead menu driven , it saves so much time when you're spot you only 5 minutes get shot , you just hit dedicated white balance button ! voila !, vibrant accurate color reproduction touch button . focus zoom both give right amount resistance when turning , making it easy get exact focus zoom you want . color shift feature also very useful , allowing you change camera settings so ccds pick up all colors perfectly ( vx2100 notorious colder , more bluish picture compared vx1000 ) . integrated neutral density filter quite useful those really bright days when glare overwhelmingly present distracting . overall , this camera incredibly depth sheer choices you make tweak picture just right . maneuverability : this camera just right size when it comes handheld filming . most weight camera towards front , but perfectly balanced top handle . camera also not too long , allowing you get closer subject when using fisheye allowing you manipulate camera tight quarters . overall , this prosumer camcorder winner sony should seriously considered anyone who either aspiring filmmaker , or looking buy top class camcorder . excellent buy !	1
this camera really delivers . i appraise real estate take 40 - 100 pix week . i want slr serious work , but this camera great appraisal work because it so handy . i clipboard one hand laser measuring device other camera my shirt pocket . i switch lmd camera needed . i afraid it would easy lose but so far so good i haven't dropped it nearly often my coolpix 4300 which i gave my assistan t.t he one annoying feature on/off switch . it difficult depress must held down momentarily operate . far better system lens cover which slides back lens turn close turn off . only improvement i would recommen	1
i havent gotten these before but they look like good pair binoculars . i suggest adding these your wish list if you like outdoors	1
i got camera via fedex within five working days after ordering . camera lens factory fresh us warranty . i'm still trying learn all features since this my first digital slr , but so far , it taken good pictures . i would order this company again	1
i bought this camcorder my husband christmas . he wanted something pop into his pocket impromptu events . we old panasonic vhs-c camcorder , but battery never lasts more than 30 minutes it getting harder find vcr play it . we wanted something would record directly sd memory card , this only one we could find . however , so far , it performed very well . 3x optical zoom works good outdoor videos perfect . fact , my husband filmed my granddaughter jumping trampoline , he able get freeze frame her mid air . it not blurry or anything . indoor videos not quite good , but he hadn't figured out how turn flash/led light low light situations yet . i figure turned , indoor videos very good . so far , we very pleased this camcorder . we bought 2gb sd card go it order enough memory what we want , i also bought extra battery . i would certainly buy it again	1
first one i ever owned . overall performance pretty good i am satisfied picture quality . battery life short downloading could made easier	1
i think canon makes some best cameras market today also pretty affordable . i am really impressed excellent quality photos taken this camera . it takes such vivid clear pictures excellent color reproduction . i rarely edit any pics i take unless it cropping or zooming . i am very happy this model . i'd say only minor " complaint " i would it bit heavy 4 aa batteries intalled i've dropped it couple times when i felt like i didn't " good " grasp it . swivel lcd doesn't close totally flat anymore but it still works produces excellent quality pics .	1
this great camera people like me who mainly just want point shoot not deal too many settings . i even able teach my mother-in-law how use one we got them ( she little technologically challenged ) . there bunch different " best shot " settings easy use , but honestly most my pictures turned out best using just " snapshot " or auto mode , regardless environment/time day , etc . it would nice if you could charge battery just plugging camera , but i guess you pay little more feature . photo software comes it not good , but there plenty other things you use out there free	1

this camera exelent camara . it plenty effects , plenty modes , plenty scenery options . image quality 3.2 megapixel , but its quite good . pictures you take without flash end up getting bit blury , where if you take it flash , it comes out exelent . sometimes it takes long time picture get taken out flash , sometimes it happens imediatly . but all these flaws only my version . but if you looking good camera great price , this your best option	1

when i looking camcorder , this seemed like best bet : it almost all features i wanted , although i concerned how it would deal low-light situations . still , i discouraged read all descriptions how camera worked windows ; would it work my mac ? i emailed panasonic find out , panasonic told me i'd need hook camera up via firewire . so my parents got me camera christmas , they let me open it early so i'd familiar it when christmas arrived . i glanced through manual , i noticed trepidation there more references windows . my husband gave me ilife ' 06 christmas set it up before i tried out camera . i relaxed bit i used camera ; it easy figure out how stills ( even while shooting video ) , switch widescreen fullscreen , record , play back , etc . sound seemed doing well , too . so i my sample video still shots -- would i able retrieve them easily os 10.4.8 ? importing video piece cake , i found . i plugged camera firewire we bought ( it not included , since windows users only use usb ) , imovie offered import video soon i launched it . i played movies , imovie even interpreted where breaks make separate clips . i exported first three segments quicktime file medium sound quality , my husband his friends still raving how fantastic quality . i pleased how camera dealt light indoor situation -- it produced significantly better video quality than my mom digital camera ( which , admittedly , primarily intended stills ) . usb cable still necessary transfer still photos computer . my first impression stills shot during video recording not high-quality stills shot separately . flash might help , too ; still shots give impression less light than movies . images aren't shockingly better than ones produced our hand-me-down ~ 2.1 mp still camera , but i'm sure they bit better . figuring out menus bit confusing if you don't initially realize different settings camera ( like motion vs . still ) different menu options . we look manual figure out how set time . most basic camera functions , though , very intuitive . bigger battery than included battery ( maybe twice capacity ? ) , i probably got least hour total operating time ; i used lcd screen most time . viewfinder electronic , so i can't think it really sucks up lot less energy than flip-out screen , but i haven't experimented their comparitive energy suckage . overall , i'm extremely pleased camera ; it just what i looking . now i just need disk space support it	1
i several digital cameras , including nikon 8700 , i feel digital still got way go , they wonderful , yet very tiring , printing gobs prints friends family tiring , tedious expensive . cameras unless using some exotic means still cannot focus well low light , also dont like taking pictures place whole world standing over my shoulder . soooo , happily back film n80 nikon 28-100 nikon i bought kit . its so great back film , now i get some control back . far 80 , it really beautiful highly intuitive use , well made , features wonderful , joy own use . i made right move , know now , shot few roles kodak color 200 , results so good , if i still want get lazy , photo processor put shots disc , havnt it yet , enjoying prints too much , think i , ll run out get some echtekchrome . photography important component me my life , n80 bringing it all back slick very competent manner i completely enjoy it	1
nikon always leader photography/ camera/ lenses . others nobly tried but nikon remains high bar others only hope reach . when shift film digital began , there some speculation if nikon could keep up competition . well , rest assure not only they kept up , they continue lead way . latest example this d200 . like d70/ d80 - this solid piece equipment . just feel it tells you you holding excellent piece technology . but proof always end results again , combination nikon know-how nikon lenses lead even beginner come up excellent pictures . gone " lag shots " . you fire up shoot multiple pictures seconds so action shots all yours . without even " tweaking " picture computer program , you print top line photos home . people cited cons : expensive . yes . camera come hefty price tag but it should kept mind this piece machinery intended serious photographers . if you " vacation holiday " picture taker , then you should elect buy cheaper camera . same true difficulty multitude small buttons , dials switches . there too many they overwhelming but only someone who " point shoot " school picture taking . anyone else relish options nikon provided us d200 . room improvement ? well , battery life nowhere near good d70 which i upgraded but weak complaint you still get hundreds shots one charge . also , it would boon if flash would automatically pop up when needed like former models . so if you serious photography always one ready , this one you	1
first off , let me make it clear i am satisfied this camera . i it 8 months now i put it through its paces its held up fine . but there few things you must know : camera no zoom . i mean , practically no zoom . 2.2 may look decent but its pointless any real-life situation . you find yourself moving lot your camera get better shot , not standing one place using zoom feature . you never get close wide shot - its just not possible this camera . this camera great average stills but that it . you click twice take picture or " press halfway then fully " according manual . this major pain . sometimes when battery weak , it may take lot time take picture ( lot frustration ) , so this not cam capture any special pictures or " kodak moments " . apart these cons , camera great value money offers video all kinds stuff . if you're looking mostly looking take landscape or portrait stills , this camera good job	1
