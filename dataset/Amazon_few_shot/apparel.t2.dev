whole rubber wristband thing gotten out hand . your part put it rest buying regular wristbands . when it all charities before-thats okay . but it ridiculous now . heres rules : -livestrong = okay because original -everything else = no . -people who wear like 5 them = probably main reason why you'd starting wearing regular ones . plus they're way better not some cheap piece rubber cost . 2 cents make . anyways ... end fad !!!	1

if you're tired one-color dri-powers ( which very functional ) this adds bit style keeps original functionality . particularly if you huge expanse shoulder-to-shoulder area , this breaks up monotony little . monocolor dri power tees work fine but these make wear interesting enough not look like something you'd wear shirt , not under your shirtthe material just good , wicking away sweat fast . i've realized wicking keeps dampness creating gym sock smell . fresh sweat , gross it sounds , doesn't sickening odor . when it gets evaporate fast , you last little longer before smelling like socks . i find dri-powers most valuable if you go bike get coffee or small groceries you don't want people store maintaining perimeter around you	1
i bought these shoes go black dress i recently purchased . i hate get new pair shoes one outfit but there no way around it . i'm short but hard time shoes any kind heels because my feet fairly wide somewhat flat . i'm usually mindset you get what you pay but this case its not true ! these shoes not only inexpensive but extremely comfortable wear they're adorable !	1

these slippers wonderful . they really warm , they strong supportive enough you go outside them ... like get mail .... soles thick enough , so if you step rock you won't get hurt . when they get dirty you throw them wash all your other clothes , theyu come out like new . i recomend puting them dryer though , bring them back their " brand-new " quality , even though they dry just fine without dryer . only reason thses slippers not 5 stars because they tend hold smells , so inside footbet get kinda smelly after while . but despite this i strongly reccomend these slippers .	1
i just got this shoe it awesome . it comes 1/2 size too big though . nice leather sooo comfy . there actually little padded arch support . great shoe	1

well , why not ? you've got very decent amount colour choices , you pick brass silver buckle . i picked silver black combination , when it shipped it more then i expected ; same exact thing local mall you would pay twice much that not considering tax . only difference this one other belts similar design i've seen they all seem logos , either engraved or cut out . i don't enjoy sporting i giant logo my waist . i much rather get what i want pay less it . buckle not design opens closes , rather you slip belt through buckle tighten it sliding metal bar foward . if you close it tightly enough , it hold lot weight , far more then open/slip belt through/close buckle belt design . i carry bunch things mine , including heavy multi-tool , knive , phone , several pouches filled various manner junk , tape measure , occasionally heavy construction tools . granted belt wasn't meant this kind weight but ... normally after few minutes my old buckle would just pop open weight ... no such problem here . it opens closes without trouble fit large waist easily . what more you want belt ?! =) andrew christian speedy enough shipping it ; it came few days after my amazon order , which 3-5 business days . great deal	1
