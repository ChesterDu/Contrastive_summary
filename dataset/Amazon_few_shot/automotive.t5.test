i'm really surprised negative reviews these wipers . i bought two pairs wipers just over year ago , expecting i'd second pair backup . i haven't needed second pair - first pair still just like new - they don't squeak , chatter , or smear great visibility . i live seattle , so it not like i never use them either - we've deluged rain last year ! only thing i think maybe others mistreating their wiper blades . keep your windshield clean , if wipers smearing , just wipe cleaning edge off paper towel time time . that not problem blade , that problem cleanliness your windshield blade . any wiper blade struggles when it bogged down dirt , pollen , road grime . i figure eventually i'll use my backup pair , but until then i'm happy	1

i've learned my mistakes . i've purchased two cheaper jump starters ( one coleman , one vector , probably made same folks ) both stank . they don't give enough power than more than couple cranks warm weather , worse cold . worst all , cheap plastic clamps broke . it difficult open them wide enough . this charger , other hand , works very well , it great value . lots more power , charges up efficiently , solid all metal clamps . you need extension cord small enough female end charge it , but that easily found . btw , aside obvious uses this product , it nice male-to-male cigarette lighter extension cord . this allows you provide power your vehicle when you swapping out dead battery giving your problems , which means all electronic settings your vehicle preserved during swap	-1

get yourself " photoblocker " this license plate or risk victimized some deputy do-right his shiny new toy : traffic camera . rumor it several class-action suits underway while others won against these cameras . i lost $180 tickets fiefdom chicago before installing this system . tinted lense covers your plate protects you losing your tag . my tag stolen once weather took during past 4 years . solution i chose couple coats photoblocker smoke cover lense over top ; i tried get polarizing sheet 3m but they would not sell it me because most states making these defenses illegal . principle operation simple : photoblocker reflects back light camera flash , smoky lense deadens some reflection but obscures it ( like polarizing sheet)making it even harder read than photoblocker alone . also , itself , lense make it little harder see your numbers daylight . law , your numbers must visible but there no scientific minimum so anything you inconvenience cops benefit you . fyi : photoblocker works because traffic cameras need flash . it all shutter speed . capture clear picture moving object -- obviously , you racing through stop sign -- you must flash . if you tried without flash shutter speed would too slow catch anything but blur . sending pulse reflected light you cause photo over-exposed . one makers traffic camera says all they re-develop picture . perhaps , but i seem remember you would need develop two pictures put together photos . this seems like lot trouble police department may even require re-programming software their digital cameras . they probably won't bother : there lot people without counter-measures cameras costs them fortune anyway . if this review helpful , please add your vote -- thanks	1
