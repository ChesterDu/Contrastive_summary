we live 1.5 story home where master only thing upstairs my husband runs isp home - lots computers house , so we find good monitor would drown out static electronics outside world , but allow us hear our little pip-squeek clearly . first i thrilled sony when i used it downstairs during her daytime napping loved i could set it voice-activated only hear it when she reallllly awake ! but night when we used it upstairs it kept picking up interferrence form loud static chirp after several hours silence even though it voice-activated mode . i tried moving it several times , but finally ended up going back old fp sounds lights one we which really wasn't any better ! ( run up down stairs try all combinations 9 channels receiver transmitter sony royal pain ! ) next day i went target found first years digital 2.4 ghz monitor what difference ! it same price sony , but it searches clear channel like your phone . i afraid it would interfere out 2.4 ghz phones , but after week , no problems we no static/interferrence ! it crystal clear no matter where house ( hubby even took it into computer room able hear her wake up just fine ! ) i know everyone environment different , but sony definately didn't work us	1
i usually love first years products . i already fisher price healthy care booster seat loved it . i wanted leave one my parents one travel so i thought i'd try this one . i expecting love swing feature , it one thing i thought missing out fisher price one . well , i returned this chair w/in 24 hours bought second fisher price one . here reasons why ; base chair hollow wobbly , it also very wide didn't comfortably fit across normal kitchen chair . you attach straps yourself when purchased they also too wide . their tightest level they still way too loose secure . thought swing out feature would great but when tray swings out , then you wipe baby hands , you're putting your hands under his pits lift him off , he already got his hands leftover mess tray . back chair comes off every time you fold it down . you take chair apart adjust level . when folded up , it not compact portable fisher price model . yourself favor splurge extra $5 healthy care booster seat .	-1
this product absolutely useless . save your money . first problem this product area supposed fit over buckle part car seat carrier simply not fit over it . addition , there no way attach it carrier , stroller , or whatever . so when you try put your child into wherever you wish use it , all it slide around . so it more hassle trying use it every time than just dealing occasional blowout	-1
i've tried lots storage bags , far medela ranks lowest . these spill , you store them upright freezer ... if your freezer compact mine food feed five people , storing milk upright just too hard . these bags not ziplock seal them , which means they leaky unreliable if you hurry ( like if you more than one kid you work ) . buy gerber or lansinoh bags zip seals them . they both stored flat more convenience , they stand their own . pumping into bag fine if you someone who wants fumble attaching it pump ( medela bags ) , or you use your medela pump your reliable pump kit pour your milk into gerber or lansinoh storage bag ease . i use medela lactina plus , i find this method works best me . simple , clean easy .	-1

okay , maybe i should read laundering instructions , which say machine wash then " drip dry " - but who makes baby items can't machine dried ? how many parents time line-dry delicates ? upshot this fell apart - melted dryer got fluff all over everywhere - first time we ever washed it . if you need something you throw washer/dryer when it gets dirty not worry sorting , this not your product . grrr	-1

we switched bottles my daughter more times than i would like admit . she gas discomfort all them . i decided try avent bottles ... i bought twelve them first they seemed relieve some gas . but they leak horribly . sometimes it few drops . but most times it like continuous stream formula . couple times i wasn't paying close enough attention bottle while feeding formula ended up soaking my daughter bib , her sleep sack , her onesie , my shirt . entire bottle emptied all over us before i knew it ... leak fast ! i tried every suggestion given me : mixing formula seperate container , mixing it bottles , using sealing disks mix bottle ; heating before adding bottles , heating bottles ; wetting nipples , not wetting nipples ; making sure bottle rim properly inserted into nipple ring , etc . i wrote letter avent called twice this issue . each time , customer service rep spoke down me said i must not read followed directions ( which i ) . don't waste your money these expensive , poorly designed bottles !!! these worst market my experience .	-1
i owned my diaper dekor plus 25 months . 2005 , i found glowing reports wall street journal most other places . it definitely easy use refills last quite awhile , but ... trapdoors broken twice . i contacted regal lager year ago they sent free replacement . free replacement broke less than 6 months later . you can't expect it contain smell when trapdoors always broken ! this week , i contacted regal lager again they said replacement $10 . i loved this pail until trapdoors broke . unfortunately , it looks like it common design flaw i browse reviews last year or so . i am engineer i don't know what say , except i am really annoyed product not more durable . regal lager would well spend some time money engineer more robust spring system , instead relying $10 replacement parts-especially since loyalty diaper pails so fickle ! now i decide whether spend $10 replacement , try fix it myself , get different pail or maybe none above . what point enough , enough ?	1

i've heard some say this best warmer available . if so , parents s.o.l. heating so inconsistent . same amount water same amount milk produce different temperature every single time . sometimes way too cold sometimes way too hot . when heating indicator light turns off you must right there pull bottle out or it continue significantly warm bottle without any water medium . sure loosen your bottles cap during heating check see travel disc not place . otherwise , bottles ( esp . brown ) overflow . if happens cleaning inside warmer major hassle because milk burned onto heating plate . carrier too short mr. brown 8oz . bottles or any other similar height . tubes provided premeasure water joke . caps so hard close open you need two really strong hands maybe multiple tools shut or flip tops open . course , you likely holding your crying squirming baby one arm while trying open cap not spill all water . they tried get fancy shape tubes cap they forgot make them easy use . i just can't believe someone can't design better " mouse trap " . add insult injury , taps handle supposed hold top bottle storage compartment just broke off ... ( picture provided amazon not current model . refer pictures posted other shoppers	1

i purchased this when i due my second baby . i thought peg perego products supposed so great - they always so much more expensive . i don't mind spending $$$ if you get better , but this just horrible stroller . it doesn't turn easily all , wheels constantly get stuck . there one cup holder soooo small doesn't stay upright . there no room any storage : bags , pocket book , keys , phone , snack . they trays kids front so small narrow . seats too tight small- they not comfortable children whether they awake or asleep . there nothing i like this all , it makes going out where ever not easy all . amounnt money theu nerve charge this , they should ashamed . i actually use my orignal " cheap " single stroller , instead .	-1

i ordered this product my 3 year old who just moved into toddler seat head slumping problems ! two major problems this product 1 . ) it quite bulky , so her head would tend fall forward anyway , 2 . ) check if it fit your carseat . i apex toddler seat quite wide , you can't leave pillows place , they stand up 45 degree angle . i attached elastic bottom order fix them plastic holds seat pad place . this works , but obviously only if you're sitting next them when they fall asleep ! other than you'd stop car , get out attach them , then go again , which time child probably awake anyway ! honest , i haven't seen better alternative yet though . it quite good pull around use pillow your own head long trips though	1

we bought this tubside seat just today tried it out first time our baby , who 5.5 months old just sitting up his own . initially it looked great , seemed very sturdy we thought he would love able sit play his toys . however , getting him out we noticed plastic edges around where his legs go actually very sharp , our baby tall end spectrum , it impossible get him out seat without scraping up his little legs knees . it not if he going get any shorter , so i don't think there any solution problem . i think safety 1st could better job making plastic area more comfortable , or even put some padding location . i'm surprised more reviewers didn't this problem . our baby , who normally loves bathtime , it painful frightening experience . we returning item . since you can't leave your baby unattended water anyway , we might well just get non-slip mat hold him until he gains more balance . i recommend you save your money this one	-1

very efficiently drains much milk i get pump style advanced me , very portable easy clean . i use it when i little more time or when i don't expect pump more than couple ounces ( feedings ) . despite medela warnings , i would say you could use this pump daily , aslong you careful fully drain breast ( massage ) , but maybe not okay maintaining supply multiple pumping row	1
this amazing i tell ya , seriously i've doubted it since my first child , then my twins ( never got it ) them , just assumed it some hype . well my last baby , finally girl , i caved . its hard hold baby all day long when you hve 3 other children home keep order ( or try ) anyway her screams out no where , she wasn't happy put anywhere sleep other than you . sometimes wasn't good enough . she cried cried waled . it really drove us all bonkers . she isn't pacifyer baby either , so we loss . she obviously really gassy , she got hiccups alot . she breastfed we couldn't figure out what it , maybe i eating ? sure enough today we tried it , she peacefully sleeping without stirring . i recomend it 110% . my husband got it his work 20% discount , i'm so relieved	1
i bought this chair my third child wish i would've it first two well . it easy assemble , easy use easy clean . i like recline feature 5 point strap because my baby could sit/lay it fairly young age . i love wheels because i could rock him my foot talk him while doing dishes or making dinner . one hand release tray dream moms who could use eight hands ! my son seems enjoy toys , too . i only wish it came extra trays	1
this baby gate great !!! top my stairs both walls going 2 different angles i am so glad i found this gate ! it works great i havn't any problams it all . i installed it soon i got it . i didnt seem any problams installing it . i 2 yr old all moms dads out there know how 2 yr olds trying out new things ! it tall gate so he cant lean over it fall . all bars it vertical so he cant climb it . lock it easy use but he cant unlock it . gate made out metal welded together so you dont worry bars coming out like you wooden gates . i highly recomend this gate any room any doorway its great top stairs	1
this my second superyard . first one i bought many years ago when superyard made protruding metal hinges which somewhat hazardous invited mouthing little teethers . aside little stiff fold ( which might because it new ) this model vast improvment over old . it couple inches taller seems sturdier . great blocking off christmas tree or any other part house . cruising babies love go round round inside you hang busy box or other toys side amuse crawling baby . during football season , my friends i take our superyards tailgate join them together make super superyard , so all toddlers safely play together . it easy clean using pressure nozzle hose outdoors . minor drawback it scooted across floor or climbed out determined toddler . i really need say any play yard should always used only under adult supervision ? final comment - one most useful pieces child-care equipment i've ever owned . only reason i gave it 4 stars insteat 5 because my experiences north states ' customer service poor	1
bundleme must any mom . it works so well ! it really eliminate need coats or even jackets . first time i used it i thought my daughter might get little chilly top half so i put jacket her . soon i indoors took her out bundleme i saw she too warm . she actually sweating . ever since then i use it without anything else she stays very warm cozy . we lots snow cold winters where i live bundleme original perfect . no more fussing blanket gets kicked off moment your baby back seat car . top piece also option zip all way off so if it only part needs washed you don't take straps out bottom piece . you also unzip both sides keep over heating your baby if you'll indoors short period time . i think every mom should one i would definitely buy one again	1

this seat took us complete refusal use regular plastic potty almost completely trained . starters , kids like using same seat mom dad .. this seat allows them comfortably . it not too big not too small , fits any toilet travels like dream . mom boy , i don't use plastic guard because it sticks up too much over seat , but even boys this seat mess free . boys , there usually little mess , but because it plastic you wipe it easily . i love it , my son loves it . i wish i hadn't bought potty because my son refuses use it .. only this seat	1
other parents told us these , specifically vanilla scented ones . baby #1 bottle fed took advent pacifier right away . we used scented soothies whenever we couldn't get bottle ready fast enough her likes . not sure if it shape soothie pacifier or scent , but she always calmed down wihle we'd finish getting bottle ready . baby #2 also bottle fed , but not take any pacifier right away . we tried these regular soothies well vanilla ones advent ones too . she eventually took advent . it really up each baby what they like . but these definately worth trying . addition regular vanilla ones , there also various sizes , including preemie , pacifiers attached small stuffed , plush animals easier babies find put into their mouth ... also easier mom dad back car , darkened bedroom , etc	1
my 4.5 month old son never liked plastic bathing tubs , so right very beginning , he big tub tub seat . he loved bath time until just few weeks ago , when he outgrew our original especially baby ( bru " house " brand ) tub seat . desperation , we searched shelves bru settled mother touch . i can't say enough good things this tub seat . head support features soft washcloth-like insert cushion newborn delicate head , it repositioned or removed baby grows . two-position back reclines newborns , sits up straighter older babies . entire seat up high enough quite bit water needed tub , but i found it makes it easier control how deep my baby sits water ( old tub seat , he up his ears order enough water bathe ) . one things my son hated his previous tub seat he couldn't sit up it . design mother touch provides enough support allow baby sit up mostly unassisted , ample padding makes sure he doesn't bruise himself hard edges . even though there lots support padding , it still very important closely supervise your baby when using this ( or any ) tub seat . reviewer mentioned couple things things i'd like respond : * there no suction cups base : i found rubber grips provide more than enough traction , but tubs may vary . * she would like strap : seat i strap ( it stored underneath seat , so may not immediately identifiable ) , so i wonder if seat redesigned recently . overall , my son i very happy this tub seat , i've recommending it friends . they'll buy it new instead getting it hand-me-down , though . i foresee him able use it most his first year before he outgrows it !	1
this best carseat out there . it above peg perego britax . it weighs only 8 pounds so it doesn't break your arm it so easy adjust . best feature base designed so it not move car . i've graco infant seats completely flipped sideways when i made turns because they just weren't secure even special belt clip . only down side canopy bit floppy but it still it job . 5 stars !!!	1
i bought this dakota backless booster my nearly 6 year old . she previously using jupiter komfort kruiser xl100 , which i loved . komfort kruiser booster back , although it still fits her this day , she eager move into backless booster . i think dakota booster works great . it gets her height she needs seatbelt , but allows her feel more like big kid not back . this booster quality item large enough fit her until she old large enough no longer require booster . pocket side handy well , although not work well drinks ( i advise buying bottle holder put arm rest ! )	1
this one my favorite products i purchased new mommy . i love it . it warms avent bottles great . it took some trials determine how much water add but now i it down great . you over heat then you burn yourself if your not careful . it not like negative reviews if you pay attention use right amount water . it not warm playtex ventair bottles . i guess because vent but i preferred avent bottles anyway . cooler keep bottles cold up 8 hours if you remember freeze freezer pack each day . we 2 story house this helped us so much . i other first year single warmer also it my kitchen it great well . this definitly worth money	1
this item very cute . different textures ( just like bedding set ) lot fun . i hung 2 wall above my sons changing table he loves look them . my only complaint ribbon loops they've sewn hang them . mine not sewn into middle square so they originally hung uneven . you easily use nail or other type homemade hook though	1

this stroller holds up 55 lbs ., unlike most umbrella strollers which only hold 35 lbs . i love raised handle bars . they cause less strain your shoulders back . there roomy basket under seat , which great bonus . 8 wheels make it easier steer push over rocks or grass . once my son able sit up his own , i used umbrella stroller exclusively . this hands down best one i ever . it also very modern looking black gray	1
we 4 yr old twins 18 month old , selected this gate means block off our dining room living room . we needed gate ( which already came one extension panel ) plus one more extension panel ( we purchased additional ) total 107 inches across . it wasn't horrible install -- just read directions first allot your self couple hours . if you measure well take your time , it not difficult . also best attach it stud wall xtra durability . durability , you need adult sized hand open this latch -- my almost 5-yr-olds can't it . extra foot adds stability . baby tried many times push it over or break through latch never succeeds . we like you set it swing only one way if you choose , since it prevents it smacking into our dining room chairs . appearance , neutral oak this gate looks soooo much nicer than those pricier metal things . we've received many compliments our wide spaces gate ( matching stairwell gates ) guests , it only takes seconds slide out wall brackets store if we're entertaining company . i think some previous posters either way too high expectations baby gate ( it not brick wall ! ) , or installed it wrong . i would recommend this gate anyone , especially those multiples need gate off portion large area create safe playspace	1
we haven't any problems cleaning this chair -- occasionally we need use crevice tool vacuum , but simple enough . most time , we simple take wet paper towel or wet wipe run it around seat sides . ( we'd any high chair . ) tray doesn't fit our dishwasher , but too easy clean sink . we love neutral plain color oatmeal vinyl . our daughter very happy her chair . she only 16 months , but very big her age she no problems fitting this seat all . our only complaint we push tray release handle when we put tray order lock it into place or else our daughter push tray almost out . may defect ours rather than design flaw -- we just live it since it isn't big deal .	1
i bought this my second son who year old . i love it . it compact fits easily diaper bag . after he eats , i take it restroom it rinses right off . i've started using it home too because little tray front catches food really well ( saves my floors ! ) . i recommend anyone who hates see their child rub their food all over germy table buy this !!	1
it works great me . i 2 floor + 2 kids + 2 cats before i didn't know what going my house . now i hear any sound - guests coming , kids playing/watching tv even when cats jump dining table steel some food . it makes some fone sound max volume , but i don't care - i just reduse volume or change unit position . i strongly recomend this monitor	1
i havent any problems bottles leaking like others stated , but i guess i always check make sure lid right . suction isnt too fast , which great . my baby doesnt get choked . she latches easily nipple since it same pacifier she loves . my only gripe since bottles so wide they cover whole lower part her face it smooshes her nose . there isnt curve bottle , so when milk gets low you either lean baby back more , which i dont like , or either mash bottle her nose . its avoidable , but i tend it whithout realizing sometimes . id rather just stick bottle like playtex curver or bottle slimer . i still use bottles , but i just make sure whole time i'm feeding it isnt mashing her nose so she breath	1
we got our maclaren stroller few weeks ago . we love it . my husband i both tall ~ me 5'7 " him 6'1 " . both us use this stroller without slouching or kicking wheels when we walk . stroller folds unfolds easily maneuvers beautifully . i highly recommend this stroller anyone who taller wants convenient stroller .	1

( i show couple guests how it without damaging it ) . we trouble delivery , only because ups left it entryway wrong house - - - one next us empty up sale . assembly little difficult because instructions all pictures very few words . if it installed two walls no molding obstructions , it fine . however , my case , i high 6-inch baseboard i wainscotting chair-rail . these moldings created uneven surfaces i could not install gate without making wooden spacer blocks i paint white match gate . it took me five hours get it , i'm handy ( although bit perfectionist ) . anyhow , it looks works great , we've gotten compliments it . i thought it bit expensive , but i could not find anything else looked good ; it installed top stairs leading into our formal dining room . despite work install it high price , it worth it me .	1
mixed reviews this gate , i hesitated buying it , but i wish i hadn't! my house rather small but there large open area kitchen , living room , hallway , door basement ; this highest traffic area house . also , none walls or corners straight across each other making it impossible use more " traditional " gate . i actually found it easier not attach this gate wall so i change what part house i want my daughter access . it possible gate tip over if my 2-year-old daughter playing it , so i made rule she not allowed " play " gate . it took her day adjust but now she no problem it . i'm not sure durability gate since i not it long , but i think price well worth my daughter safety my peace mind	1
this best , wish i'd invented it ! no more ziploc bags wasted , no more cheerios all over supermarket floor ! this little cup lets child reach fingers pull out several treats ( cheerios , goldfish , etc ) munch away without spilling . no more mess or crumbs all over car , store , house , etc ! i love it ! bought 3 pack , twice ! i keep one my diaper bag road trips ! my daughter using it 1 yr old	1
we swaddled our daughter forever , it worked miracles us she loved it . i also so much more comfortable ease knowing she bundled up nice warm night . then she got too old it i so irritated just leave her crib no blankets or anything . then i saw these i tried them out i love them . we bought fleece ones they keep her so warm . she cuddle them if she likes nice warm like she used swaddle . she seems like them . bottom line her tummy , chest , toes kept warm safe way . i highly recommend these . fleece ones quite warm so if you live warmer climate i would recommend cotton ones	1
few these my new daughter just loved them ! she hated swaddled prefered freedom something like this . plus i never worry her tangling blankets when sleepsack . also not too awful late night diaper changes since it zips bottom	1
we just received this today . it didn't take me too long put it together myself ( hubby deployed ) . i secure my son his sister crib couldn't find proper screw driver but it put together common kitchen knife 45 minutes . only problem i am so far back keeps wanting pop out this one snap parts . my son , john , so excited when he saw this just loved playing it rest afternoon . he went bed right away he couldn't wait get back here .	1
this great product i'm glad i went ahead bought it . i go jogging my daughter nearly every day , so i needed something would block sun well . i using light blanket clothespins , but wouldn't you know , just i got going good jogging pace , my daughter would remove clothespin " shade " no more . i stopping fix it more than i actually jogging . this sunshade , she can't undo it ... although she tries ! i pull it all way down ( low i my particular jogger ) she still see out but shielded sun . i like side pockets - great keys small items - velcro tabs easy use . only drawback - this such minor issue , probably hardly worth mentioning - shade doesn't fold up all nice compact like instructions say . i wrestled my shade awhile before i finally got it folded up ( it matter " doggone it , this thing isn't going get best me ! " ) ... even then , it wasn't very stable . my suggestion - keep little bag it comes semi-fold it store it . all all , this worth it . wish i'd one when i started jogging my daughter last year	1
these good sturdy cloth diapers , whether you use them diapers or burp cloths . absorbancy quite good . i use both these , quot ; gerber prefolded absorbant layerquot ; diapers . diaper service ones not quite good two reasons-1 . ) they difficult pin , work much better velcro closure diaper covers ., 2 . ) they take longer dry drier , thus increasing laundering costs	1
my son born july 04 i usually keep my house very cold ! i noticed when i put him crib swaddled up blanket came minutes later check him , he some how squirmed his way out blanket cold ! my first child , i freaked ! so we went trip babies us ( because every mother ( you know what i'm talking ) , anything just go back store ) i found this item . i only bought one try out go back least 3 more . they great !!! they light one summer you buy thicker one winter .. my son wore this bed till he least 8 months old he wore long sleeve onsie underneath keep his arms warm ! you can't go wrong this ,,, i promise you !!!!! you no longer worry your baby getting out their covers getting cold	1
experienced original diaper genie my baby niece 2 years ago , royal pain this bottom load diapers change out liners . it seemed like liner needed replacing every couple days , probably due " twisting " sausage effect . i received this new diaper genie ii gift my newborn , wow . it truly easy load liner , i used it last wednesday through this tuesday before needing empty it . emptying it easy advertised , i slipped liner through cutter tied off top dirties tied bottom liner where we starting over again . first , it took two hands un-snap lid get it open because it new , now after week it adequately broken , it truly one-handed operation . even though baby newborn , she producing some massively stinky diapers . prior receiving genie ii , we using regular trashcan . genie ii completely contained smell since it use , my nursery now blessedly odorless ! liner situation great . diapers not come contact actual container which extremely sanitary , love it ! also , it seems you safely stuff lot diapers into each load which great . bottom line , i give my highest recommendation this product , 5 stars plus !! this my signature shower gift others now unless i get beaten it	1
my 4 1/2 month baby girl fits well this . i bit hesitant first not sure if she would fit but it all fits very nicely . make sure you decent screwdriver . take 30 mins set it up . my last chair grace 8 years ago chairs come long way . much nicer fit very smooth move around if needed . toy just icing cake . would not even think twice recommending this . this chair considered one best chairs babies . always review [ ... ] .. this group bundles up all reviews all web sites , etc . 2 thumbs way up ////	1
i originally purchased avent everything - bottle warmer , microwave steam sterilizer , etc therefore thought bottles would great . however , avent bottles leaked everywhere you could hear my son sucking tons air when he ate , causing tremendous amount gas etc . because i used avent , i bought wide neck dr. brown bottles they life saver . i threw all my avent bottles away . dr. brown bottles never leak my son rarely any gas so much happier - i also nurse him these nipples seem fit my son little mouth similarly breast . bottles also easy clean - just one more ( easy ) step than other bottles .	1
i got this gate my two miniature pinschers i love it . i use it pressure mount doorway . i previously one those plastic ones all holes but i opted this one not only look but safety . it virtually impossible dogs climb over it . it get scratched very easily , but doesnt bother me , i expected it two small dogs scratching it when they want out ! overall i impressed design how well made it . i would recommend this anyone small dogs long you dont mind scratches	1
i purchased this item myself , i absolutly love it ! bundle me makes it so easy get baby ready go , instead put coat her , etc . i get many compliments it , am glad i spent extra money this version , material so soft warm , it great quality . now instead getting my daughter new coats fit her , ( match her wardrobe ! ) i bundle me ready go , already carseat ! i would definately recommend this item , would proudly purchase it gift anyone baby wintertime	1
according consumer reports , this car seat one only two car seats pass all crash tests . i highly suggest parents ( soon parents ) check out consumer reports before buying any car seats . price it worth it !	1
this wonderful product infants not quite ready adult tub , but too big baby tub . i love how it fits perfectly into regular tub , so it easy fill/drain make easier transition when my son becomes too big it . my son loves playing rings seems very comfortable . my brother super-picky , but after seeing my son tub he bought one his daughter	1
i find these quite convenient giving my baby breastmilk bottle . playtex one-step storage system , i pump directly into liner stick it fridge , then i pop it nurser when it time feed . my husband other caregivers quite glad ease putting it all together when they're juggling crying baby . advice others , i wonder whether original nurser gift set might better , because it comes multiple different kinds nipples , whereas this set only comes silicone slow flow . we've lucked out , my baby seems happy it switches easily breast bottle vice versa ; however , it might handy able try different kinds see which babe likes best . shells this set more modern looking , but i can't see how matters . i'm pretty sure pieces both interchangeable . nice silicone nipples this set ( all other pieces ; latex nipples less hardy ) dishwasher safe , repeatedly boiled sterilization if desired . short shells this set fine , it easier reach bottom squish liner your fingers ( help it collapse ; drop-in liners relatively more shape-holding than regular liners , so they suck air ) , but usually my baby more than 4 oz sitting ; 8oz size shell , burper nice ( it hard reach when liner less full ) , but it doesn't squish liner all way , so we end up taking off shell using our fingers last 2 oz or so . i never any problem leaking . i like disposable bit this system , since nipples , collars , lids take up enough space cleaning effort without bunch bottles around well . liners pricy if you use lot ( $5 50 walgreens ) , but since we only use bottle day , it doesn't seem like much . they also freeze easily . this set came one adapter breast pump ( i use ameda purely yours , they fit together perfectly ) , one-step comes , so i use double pumping without buying any other pieces . overall , i'm very happy this set	1
this great booster seat so far ! it light east carry my son loves it . i like fact it folds half when we travel it easy handle . also , great price such great seat	1
i received this shower gift ( i'm resurfacing new mother - my only child now 11 , so i'm starting over again ... ) it soooo easy swaddle my newborn son . i remember struggling my daughter get her wrapped up receiving blanket matter minutes her wriggling out swaddle . my son , he cuddly this swaddle hours sleeps soundly . even my husband , who two left thumbs wrap him up snuggly without my help supervision ! my only thumbs down this product i notice repeated use my son wriggle his arm out it it looser age . also , i notice it tendency bunch up neck , so you careful when you wrap little one up swaddle . however , benefits far outweigh those two glitches	1
this great . we it our 7 month old son who crawling all over place . he loves hang out here play . he doesn't hurt himself if you add foam playmat under it , it even safer . it nice insetead playard because you sit there kid hang out him . it gives him alot room play crawl . he stand up hold sides . he even stood himself ! other cool thing all toys one spot ! we two baskets toys there him play . this portable light . it kind pain reshape ;( which why it got 4 stars ) but once you it together , it pretty sturdy . it also indoor-outdoor , which great people backyards , decks or pools . folds up very compactly . you could easily store this closet when not use . overall , it great product well worth money . i highly recommend it .	1
this steamer works great , holds more accessories than avent sterilizer . it very easy use . plus , it twenty bucks less than avent . more money use diapers	1
i graco side side stroller . like most strollers , canope this stroller almost useless . why it so hard companies figure out what we mom really want ? functionable canope would one thing example . most strollers they joke . so i bought this sunshade . positive : folds up flat easily ; attaches easily ( though you may fiddle bit find best position ); side pockets nice extra help weigh shade down some well ( you perhaps hide some goodies there because they really not easy spot ); it shelters side well ; negative : hello .. slight wind this thing bends backwards or moves sideways ; when sun comes front , while setting , you can't really pull it down far enough protect your children . living island we deal wind all time so it not practical i would like this shade . but still would recommend it over leaving child just exposed . perhaps if you less wind deal you really like this shade . i gave it 4 star because it protect my children what matters . you deal negative points , but i wished it would designed all weather . i don't see how you attach weight still allow it stand up correctly . material too thin . but i am open ideas suggestions . i don't problems folding stroller together while shade attached . perhaps just matter trying see what you prefer like . all all it worth money afford because your little ones deserver need proctection . till strollers made better canopes , we rely something like this . i also peg perego aria stroller bought single one one . same issue , problems wind but otherwise nice protection . yes you fold it back when you put baby . perhaps main concern designer . easy acess baby .	1
this mobile sends him off sleep every time . i love music lasts so long -- wind up ones , he would just start settle down when it would shut off . there two volume levels ; usually quieter one enough bedtime . my only ( minor ) complaint remote control it makes loud clicking sound when you press it ( enough make him stir , but not wake up ) .	1
i needed gate odd sized doorway looked all them least twice . this gate great bargain extensions included(which expensive buy separately other gates ) . i found it very sturdy no movement or realignment when it closes . i didn't want use hardware install it never problem bar bottom . i installed it my 9 month old tugging climbing me no problems . it good appearance easy operate(visitors figure it out after 1 or 2 tries ) . i received many good comments visitors i am very glad i picked this one .	1
this bottle solved these problems us : gasspit upmilk leaking out baby mouthlow birth weight(she just wouldn't eat much)my baby started out life breastfeeder 2 weeks diagnosed milk allergy . she not gaining weight . she switched soy . i didn't want try these bottles . i tried gerber , evenflo , playtex , avent . my mom read they helped colic so she brought me one . i used one bottle two days until i could get store . since then , i retried all those other bottles . she started eating less losing more it out side her mouth spiting up again . this her favorite . so it worth it me	1
well , i ordered this item overnight because my 19 month old began climbing out crib again . he this months earlier , when crib not lowest setting , so time problem easily solved . this time , not so easily ... i so afraid he would crack his head open our hard mexican tile floors ! many other moms wrote how their kids seemed love it . wsh i could say ! i love it , because i know it protecting my child potentially very harmful fall . but , he really freaked out it first few nights . i think it would nice if it go higher up , higher arch , thus not making it feel so confining , so much like caged . so he didn't like it all , but , it five or six nights now he used it , simply checks it out , then rolls over goes sleep . but it cost us some tears . ( i'm not talking hours here , five minutes max , worst night ) . anyways , all all , i think it great product all parents who want protect their little monkeys potential injuries .	1
i got this my daughter , who very big her age , grew out her infant tub 6 months . she sit up well , but i worried her falling/slipping hitting her head . this product easy use works very well ! instructions tell you make sure your tub clean dry , you must follow these instructions if you want suction cups hold ! bonus -- it covers up lever you flip up down stop up tub , too !	1
i am very pleased this purchase . i little concerned size , i ordering it 6 year old - but it plenty big enough her , seat very wide could easily hold even larger child . if you hello kitty fan , this great chair !	1
i bought this monitor over two years ago , still love it ! especially now my son out crib . i make sure he not mischievous night without him knowing . i also enjoy plugging this into television recording times when he mishievous , or just plain cute	1
i like style ease this potty seat , but my daughter , hole much too big . she squirms it , not use it unless i am holding onto her-she starts slip fall . i am end up buying much smaller seat . hopefully she grow into this one . she 2 1/2 little small side	1
this toy bin such great investment . i'd give it 5 stars if it just tad bigger . it not only functional toy box , but light portable , carry handles , collapses storage travel , interactive toy itself its " mirrored " flower bright , colorful , textured surface . my baby loves this so i . i it both designs - fish flower	1

i finally picked up jogging stroller now my boy 17 months old . it easy put together very quiet . since its brand new there hasn't time it get squeeky ! my only complaint it seemed lean right until i walked it mile . then it corrected itself i think it nice . other thing left back tire rubbed one time break sits up above when unlocked . but could some uneven ground . i sport model doesn't come mp3 thing i think . i'll just listen birds ambient sounds instead .	1
friend mine bought this item me first i thought " wasted " her money . i noticed she bought it me l-xl course i thought this never ever fit me , after all my pre-pregnancy size 4 . well , i sooo wrong ! into my 3rd trimester , i developed discomfort my lower abdomen back . i decided try this belt it awesome ! i've able continue working out , walking , etc ... because this belt . i love it !! my only suggestion buy bigger size .	1
i love this bumper . embroidered animals plush very cute . colorful too . just any color set you use paint/decorate rest your nursery . i just wish inside this bumper also patchwork/animal design it . instead it just plain blue -- like trim outside . so , when you walk into room look into crib , what you see basically blue bumper . other than , its nice bumper -- set great	1
i love these bottles using them my twin girls since week 2 their lives ( week 1 spent fighting wide necked version this bottle ) once we figured out how prevent all leaks , these bottles amazing speed up feeding time since baby drink continuously . helpful hint all dr. brown bottles : when pulling nipple thru collar , everytime run your finger around base nipple inside plastic collar make sure it fully seated before screwing nipple collar bottle . eliminates leaks completely . not over-tighten collar onto bottle . again , prevent leaks . we learned all these tricks hard way ! :) mother twin girls texa	1
i've essentials bag week now , i absolutely love it ! i small size eddie bauer diaper bag , it would constantly slip off my shoulder when i carrying infant carrier , which made things more difficult . not only this bag stylish , its functional well . my baby almost 6 weeks old , i still carry all major necessities fit my other diaper bag . if you get black gray model , dad use it also ! this what i currently carry bag : bottle holder - 1 4 oz . dr. brown bottle , definitely fit larger bottles futurelarge top compartment - 3 diapers , baby wipes case , small bottles hand sanitizer baby powder , disposable changing padmiddle compartment - 2 4 oz . dr. browns bottles formula dispenserbottom compartment - extra sleeper shirt , my wallet , keyssmall velcro compartment strap - loose coinscell phone compartment - my cell phone coursesmall zipper compartment - chapstick lipstick - there also nifty pen holder next this compartmen	1
i love this seat . its light , easy use , its pink . you looked girlly carseat ? its hard find one looks " ok " girl . can't believe i found pink one . i hated using seat without base my other kids ( 4 ) . so i purchased extra base before i even new i " needed " it .	1
although i am die hard baby bjorn fan , i am not true fan little potty . it small design , no removable bowl which makes it very hard keep clean . save your money upgrade baby bjorn regular potty which well worth money !! we keep our little potty minivan those unexpected road trip emergencies .	1
i'm thinking getting this stroller , but i need know ! thanks	1
this great booster , easy move car car since you don't strap it . cup holders perfect ! good quality	1
this spoon only one keeps my little one getting frustrated losing interest when self feeding . food actually stays spoon long enough him place it successfully into his mouth without food slipping down him getting upset because it . plus curve spoon provides just right angle him hold it enter his mouth he turns his wrist . other spoons which straight handle cannot job . it takes too long reach their mouths food falls right out . hooray sassy once again ! other manufacturers should follow their example this one	1
they look awful but if you sore cracked nipples or inverted nipples they only thing really fix what wrong . good news if you use breast shells when you need them above mentioned maladies- you won't use them long because you heal after just few days even if you wear them part time . they come little curved white sponges you just drop bottom shell . these sponges absorb milk leaks so you don't worry it comming out vent holes top when you bend over . i just would rinse them soap water clean let air dry i think each breast shell set come four sponges you buy more if you need them but 4 enough me . note : don't use them collect milk give your baby one reviewer suggested . milk collected breast shell discarded it states package instructions .	1
blue cat cushystraps so soft ! they very easy install , added bonus helping keep straps straight her carseat ... this way , when i go put her seat , straps not don't become twisted process . used bit problem our graco seat before we used cushystraps . my 3 month old daughter loves rub her face mouth straps . i imagine theywould helped hold her head too , when she newborn	1
i received combi ex travel system my baby shower . it looked like perfect size/ weight city living . unfortunately it not work out way . stroller began squeaking falling apart all bumping around brick cobblestone through city . basket also very very tiny inhibited large bar through middle . i would reccommend this stroller use smooth surfaces . carseat great easy use , but stroller not what i expected . one tip urban parent -- sink your $$ into good stroller shocks . it worth it	1
i just baby so writing review totally amazing thing this stage game - that how much i love this thing . they should pass it out hospital . regular swaddles come undone . this one stays place you change diaper without disturbing arms , which so important . buy more than one .	1
i've tried number monitors both my kids ( returned several well ) , but this monitor hands down best longest range least crackling noise . it pretty much quiet . my view , it not worth buying any other monitor but this one	1
i little research before buying this stool i always came back baby bjorn . i decided order it give it chance i'm glad i . it small enough fit my bathroom wide enough hold my daughter it comfortably . she loves stand it brush her teeth all time now . it wide enough move around not fall well it grip top surface little feet . i'd highly recommend this product-baby bjorn knows what they're doing	1
i thought because there no buttons or batteries my three year-old daughter would not enjoy it but i wrong . she loves it !!! this doll goes every where she . i purchased this doll help potty training it trick . this quality doll , when you squeeze her tummy she go potty . feeding her water little hard because you make sure you get bottle her mouth all way . but she doesn't care if she spits water up or if she actually goes potty . she also loves taking her into bath tub too ! not expensive other dolls but well worth money spent	1
i love this organizer . i keep diapers , wipes , cream , pacifiers , recieving blankets socks , rattle book it occupy baby during changes . it isnt meant hold very heavy things , so i put those things baskets shelves table . it holds things you need though i like plain color , one less annoyingly bright thing i am trying put unisex neautral room . i no problems straps like other readers . well worth money , great timesaver also great babyshower gift	1

we both urban lite bundle me . i'm glad we bought both ! thicker urban great colder weather . it thicker , so stiffer , than lite , which makes it easier me zip up carseat then fold ' flap ' down leave my daughter face exposed . windy , cold or nasty weather i bring flap up cover her completely short outdoor time car destination . lite flimsier , perfect early fall i'm starting use it stroller warmer winter days . i personally prefer stiffer urban , but urban so much warmer than lite i'm glad both . switching 2 very easy takes only minute or two . both versions , we just put hat baby ready go ! no jackets or snowsuits needed . we also set cushy straps ( cute fleece animal-shaped covers stroller/carseat straps cushion straps help keep child head lolling around ) those help keep top baby too exposed when you bundle me folded down or partially unzipped	1
i through 5 humidifiers last 2 months . this only one i found sufficiently job ! there no dampness or residue left after using this humidifer length time because there no vapor . after buying others like this , draws dry air releases cool moist air , i skeptical spend money this one because i found others not work well all ! when running this humidifier first time , i could actually notice difference humidity level my daughter room after running it hour . this not happen others . yes , it loud unit but you get used it it great job draining out all other noise home my toddler while she sleeping . i never problem filter or finding replacements , nor i problem my toddler taking it apart . i am very please this product continue recommend it others .	1

i bought this because my 18-month-old grandson whom i am raising started fits when it came time change his diaper . this really helped make diaper changing breeze . even though it states you should use packages you just put stack wipes although sometimes you add water them keep them moist but it works like charm . i always thought baby wipe warmers just gimmick because i not them when my kids growing up but it sure helped solve his problem . thanks so much great product .	1
i 2-year-old daughter little boy due july , so i wanted get something bit more portable than my big kate spade bag . i've looking something like this while . size great- you fit so many things it- 5 sz . 4 diapers wipe container , well snacks , toys , cell phone , wallet ... list goes . however , i am my 2nd one already- quality bag not greatest . cord cinches bottle holder broke within 2 days , one zippers fell off . i just took 2nd one vacation , though it great traveling , bottle holder already fraying top . i keep this one , however ... it only $30 , so i guess i could always get one later down road not too upset it	1
when i pregnant my son i received one those big , bulky strollers baby shower gift , but after my son grew out attaching car seat he quickly grew hate stroller - i . after much research we bought maclaren volo carbon stroller mesh backing ( we live florida so mesh perfect our climate ) i am sure i never own stroller . i remember cringing i spent $100 but we now joke it best $100 we ever spent . it really . we traveled all over country stroller - it lightweight , extremely collapsable comes shoulder strap genious addition . wheels don't stick like cheaper umbrella strollers , it take beating still keep going . 4 years 42 lbs it still carried my son without squeek . ( ok we wd-40 wheels once 4 years we it . ) mesh backing made cleaning stroller breeze . it easily steered one hand , we personally loved shape handles handle padding - pushing other strollers feels so awkward now . basket underneath incredibly handy carries surprising amount . it folds easily one hand foot . my son doesn't use stroller anymore but volo still looks works perfectly so we saving it our next child . bottom line , this stroller worth every penny you pay i t.t he one only complaint i stroller it would nice if seat reclined younger infants . if you thinking purchasing this stroller younger infants consider spending extra $ model recline . sun visor might something consider too	1
i graco car seat my first son . he always uncomfortable it he outgrew it time he four months old . he also uncomfortable accompanying stroller i hated trying get this heavy stroller out my car . whole travel system waste money . after lot research i bought combi connection car seat flash ex universal car seat carrier my second son . i very happy both . my second son almost 10 months old i'm still using this car seat . he very comfortable it , i'm dreading give up convenience him infant carrier . my son isn't exceptionally small . he light his age - he 25th percentile weight , but he tall - 90th height . i am completely shocked previous reviewer who thought this car seat too small . only reason i gave this car seat 4 stars instead 5 because canopy isn't very sturdy . other than it highly recommended	1
i just my third child buy all new things , because i got rid everything after my second child . i sling other two , but instead getting same one , i looked new ones , this far better than old . i like lighter fabric its easy fold up stuff diaper bag . you need watch dvd , but little practice anyone , even husbands use it !! my son 11 weeks old loved it since day one . when he fussy , we put him sling he instantly get quiet . this best one back support also , i think	1
i love this bumper , it keeps my son arms legs inside crib gives me piece mind sids . it also matches my pottery barn green gingham pattern perfectly	1

inexperiennced new mom , i no idea " porta crib " meant speciality sized crib not standard size ( 52 27 ) . i just figured it some kind name brand among all others . no where detailed page it describe measurements , so i assumed standard . i registered this so excited until i tried fit it it too small ! so basically , i just wanted warn new moms or moms who didn't know ~ this not fit standard cribs . however , bumper ever cuter person then photos(a good thing ) , but crib sheet very thin/cheap ( bad thing )	1
my son used this miracle blanket night until he 5 months old . he felt safe , snug , secure . he slept through night 6 weeks ! when fussy or gassy , we wrapped him this blanket he calmed down almost immediately . it definitely miracle	1
