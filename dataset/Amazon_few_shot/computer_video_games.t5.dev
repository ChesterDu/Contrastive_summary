you played any games doom series ? how metroid prime ? medal honor ? golden eye ? well , then you've played halo 2 , also , because all first person shooter games exactly same . i don't care how many times x-box magazine ( odd how magazine drools most over x-box game system magazine . ) calls it greatest game all time , i'd rather play mario power tennis which atrocious . story absolutely appauling terms science fiction orientated theme , utterly mundane , unoriginal , boring just all around unentertaining . gameplay so generic it if this first creation some fresh out college video game designer , music cliche , voice acting flat , master chief just all around retard . weapons , oh boy , weapons , again lame aspect game . alien weapons like something kid " toy gun " section toys us , human guns nothing i haven't used resident evil game . when first halo came out i didn't get big deal , i didn't even play it , then eventually i got myself x-box , decided give this installment shot - huge mistake . come think it none games x-box even worth owning system : fable decent , but got old after beating it few times , knights old republic series boring , everything else x-box i could play ps2 or gamecube	-1
beautiful graphics nice storyline , but amount times game freezes or you receive error just awful ! not mention , monsters level up you so you'll never advantage . you could pretty much beat game level 5	-1

it pretty much all said , let just say it again ' cause i'm sure firaxis/firefly plant positive reviews here . game takes ages load , voice acting silly ( british ? australian ? herman hermits ? ) , progression totally linear ( ie game fails become more complicated higher levels ) , graphics date 2002 , citizen ' fetching ' system completely random opaque . sit watch awhile : your huts change size every thirty seconds . most importantly , boo sid , boo . you could've produced this bad caesar3 ripoff called it anything , but you called it " civcity " , even put tiny civilopedia it . haven't you got enough money ? civ series brilliant . don't cash it	-1
concept this game strong , it got some cute ideas , but voice recognition - especially word " blue " - character recognition abysmal . it makes " game " exercise frustration , more than anything else . character recognition ... unless you write whatever font game programmed recognize , it going record your answers something different than what you wrote . you penalized when system doesn't recognize " blue " or correct number . if system so rigid it only accepts one way saying " blue " , then system should sound file tells you what it wants hear . number recognition , it should screen shows you how system wants numbers written , or it should able allow you enter your numbers correlate them numbers within system . ( when i make this mark , it = 4)also , " intro " content absurdly long , no way skip over it . huge waste time after first 10x you've seen it . i just got game today , i've spent hours trying figure out way say blue such game recognize it ... now , i just wish i could return opened software . i'm very frustrated entire experience	-1
i started caesar2 back when it came out . i played it hours hours loved it . when caesar3 came out i bought too loved it even more spent even more time playing . both caesar2 3 rarely crashed . things changed!i'm spending more more my time restarting caesar4 than i am playing it . 8 out 10 times i access area where you trade other cities it crashes . without trading , you make little money game essentially over . other problems i'm seeing overall performance . i don't fastest machine ( amd 2.1 ghz , 512ram , rockin ' video card 256meg mem ) but there irritating 1 second delays addition crashes . i find whole game difficult use . this not case caesar3 . unless they issue patch , i'm feel frustrated crashes . maybe i dumb down graphic setting get rid delays . my suggestion ? wait patch before buying --- or move . - jason	-1
opening cutscene introduces you blinx cat , supporting cast particulars his upcoming adventures , i found myself trying wrap my brain around basic premise story . idea secret , off-world clan humanoid cat creatures , armed souped up vacuum cleaners , responsible development dispersal time itself every known plane existence map . it seems time , when compressed tightly enough transported said cats , takes form one five different brightly-colored shapes . if these crystals left out open too long without properly introduced flow things , they turn into monsters . i could go , because game certainly doesn't stop there , but i think you get point . i like think there fairly thick line drawn cartoony fantasy super-detailed realism . generally , lot physics environmental details taken granted realistic game , because they're almost exclusively set photorealistic , lifelike location . cartoons , other hand , generally don't worry themselves particulars primarily concerned delivering good time . how much fun would wile . coyote cartoons if every time lead character suffered grisly fate , it strictly obeyed laws gravity aerodynamics ? blinx tries straddle thick line delivering story that overly detail-centric environment that right out kid show . result tale comes off way , way out left field almost completely abstract . it focuses things would better left viewer imagination ignores importance good underlying story way . beneath needless discussions why there monsters world , how time compression works how cats actually responsible all we hold dear , actual plot almost laughably straightforward generic . there princess , evil pigs kidnapped her , it up you you only rescue her save her world . that it , no side-stories , no reasoning , no subplots - just straightforward rush point point . here i thought phrase " save princess " universally recognized ages-old cliche . now , i don't want it sound like i'm railing this game just because it got few more nitpicky details than its peers it reuses old phrase way back platformer handbook its sole driving factor . it also completely lacking character development , general storytelling ongoing inspiration . none characters blinx really establish themselves individuals , including lead character himself . you don't hate pig spaceship because he trying destroy world , you hate him because every time he shows up he tries steal your money . i honestly forgot there princess end game after level three , because she never mentioned game start its finish . i mean , very first super mario brothers least reminded you princess castle end every boss fight . i don't honestly think game really designed enjoyable so much it geared overly challenging . first level half set up standard " get know you " format , simplest enemies , most routine stage layouts plenty opportunities mess around your tools . shortly thereafter , you're thrown wolves . most part , level designs very short , more emphasis cheap hits than complexity true challenge . i noticed lot overlap stage layouts , whether it retracing your steps time time again or walking catwalk ( har har ) above beginning stage invariably plummeting back start point . you'll almost always know what needs , but actually accomplishing act real trick . i just can't overemphasize how unbearably cheap most this game really . if there bottomless pit nearby , ( chances very good there ) blinx find way force himself into it , regardless what you're hitting control pad . if there enemy two feet front you you hit attack button , he'll aim random switch other side room , rather than imminent threat . that not say entirety time sweeper totally without merit , because it bring few fresh ideas table , but most part those insights hampered their surroundings . ability control time , instance , time really fresh , interesting new play mechanic still stands out today , despite limited field imitators since emerged . you rewind few seconds catch enemy unaware or rebuild crumbling bridge , pause action take advantage frozen time , knock level into slow motion , etc . all while , blinx moving around real time . it great idea , but implementation painfully short underutilized . why can't i use two controls same time ? why don't more aspects stage encourage player experiment solve problems these powers ? why doesn't ridiculous ten minute stage time limit pause , speed up or rewind when i use my time powers ? why their duration so brief , why can't i hold more than dozen uses time ? i mean , this could've really fantastic experience if time control aspect beefed up little further treated more than just auxiliary function otherwise run-of-the-mill platformer . controls , too , undeveloped , undertested nightmare . blinx himself often sluggish respond , especially when implementing his time controls . he difficulty making precise turn , whether midair or solid ground . he stops briefly celebrate when gaining item , which leaves him open constant enemy attacks . he routinely moves direction certain death , though pulled magnetic field , whether you've instructed him so or not . he'll occasionally refuse perform double jump , particularly when attempting difficult , precise leap across gaping chasm . i think it these controls most make blinx so mind-squashingly aggravating . glance , you'd imagine they'd fairly difficult screw up . you've got jump button , suction / fire button , time control button analog stick control movement . plus , there already long , established line three-dimensional platformers market years before title release , paving way ideal control experience . super mario 64 its issues , sure , but nothing like this , it trailblazer entire genre jump world 3d . it like they map leading them right treasure decided forge their own path anyway . i can't even say i'm impressed graphics showcased throughout time sweeper , either . exception lead character himsef , these some incredibly cheesy , preschoolish character designs - they feel unfinished hurried , less purposeful than you'd imagine ( especially contrast blinx himself ) . particularly insulting large population simple blobs roam around levels , trying vain bump into you cause fatal injury . here finely detailed main character , such close attention paid his wardrobe even gloss his shoes obviously debated time time again , he pitted against set monsters could've sprung life directly out pages four-year-old sketchbook . despite featuring spoken dialog track , there no english voice acting . i couldn't pinpoint language , but my wife seems think it either french or some close variation it . it certainly didn't sound japanese . while this add touch personality title , it not every day you get chance hear cat shouting something language love , it all seemed really odd out place coming out my television . everyone vocal personalities so black-and-white , too , i feel like great chance establish some much-needed individuality amongst cast lost once again here . bad guys all same deep , gravelly , transparently evil tone , while good guys all bright , cheery , squeaky high-pitched like monkeys super monkey ball . it like parody games come before , but i won't give developers enough credit assume they doing it purpose . overall , blinx really just few promising concepts thrown together one package , strapped shell far-below-average third person platformer unleashed upon unsuspecting public . time its release , it still need lot polishing , some serious scrutiny behind closed doors re-evaluation just how far some these concepts half-hearted character designs could conceivably stretched without losing any quality . top , i really don't know which audience they targeting it . game ridiculously difficult , which betrays childlike demeanor surrounds it leads me believe it meant serious gamers out there , but so bright , kid-friendly annoyingly cutesy i can't imagine anyone demographic rushing out stores release day . number spontaneous controller hurls shot through roof during my time blinx , reaching near-marvel vs . capcom 2 levels its unashamed , excruciatingly cheap hits , especially later levels . i no idea how i acquired willpower finish level eigh t.t he game adequately lengthy , offers some replay value , hidden cat medals each stage eventually unlocking production sketches , promotional materials like . once you start hunting floating cat heads those super-tough later levels , though , you'll remember why you so happy finished them first place . unless you feel like pulling your hair out clumps ( i shaved my head after experience part cleansing process ) enjoy self-mutilation , i'd recommend you stay far away	-1

first off , i cannot believe how mad this game made me . i like all kinds games , but honestly trying figure out some levels this game left me stumped . it one thing stuck somewhere retry lot , but several times during this game i stuck area no idea where do/what , etc ... even after i killed all bad guys i didn't know how get out room . this game not intuitive ( sp ? ) all ! secondly , this game should not called incredibles , it should called mr. incredible , because you play him almost all time . playing elasta-girl great , i really enjoyed part , but when there lot baddies guns , mr. incredible pain since he no way block anything , so you spend lot time getting pushed back until bad guys reload . i liked first mission dash ( when you play dash , which only twice ) you run fast ; however second mission i just lost my patience because i restart million times because i couldn't see what ahead me . playing violet bad , they should lot more her instead boring stealth mission . incredi-ball mission incredibi-sucked , it took me like hour hit something because it difficult place . i'm just finishing up game now quite frankly i haven;' enjoyed lot it , which shame because i really loved movie . some levels too hard because you barely find way something mr. incredible needs more than punch people . currently i'm rocket silo level i keep falling down trying get onto platform . what load fun 100 times or more . bottom line : playing elasta-girl fun , everything else either blah , or made me want swear lot . hopefully second game better . i'll renting instead buying , this game left me disappointed overall	-1

i've this game since it first came out i am still not sick it . i think anyone enjoys halo multiplayer would enjoy this game . lucasarts improved just everything you think first battlefront . story mode galactic conquest ( strategy mode ) excellent additions basic battlefront where you simply take over bases kill enemy ( but thank goodness they still kept this game ) . i miss some old scenarios , but lot new scenarios really good new controls make battlefront ii totally worth playing . i love improved controls , new characters , new space battles . ability sprint ingenious addition . most games you walk , or run . this game characters ability run very fast sprinting . they also kneel , lay , dive , roll . i hope all future action games adopt this . i wish characters ability punch someone , after all they just everything else . ability change your character bases you control nice addition . engineers ability repair things or take over occupied enemy vehicles great . there nice array weapons ability play specialized characters such darth vader or boba fett awesome . space battles really fun , except when you board enemy ship there only limited areas you access . graphics great hd . pros : controlsability sprintchange characters basesengineers repair things steal enemy vehiclesgraphicsmultiple scenariosa lot charactersplay specialty characters ( jedi)space battlesmultiple playing options ( strategy mode , story mode , basic battlefront mode)cons : characters don't ability punch someoneboarding enemy ship space battle very limited access enemy shipsome fun scenarios first battlefront not this onethe option flying multiple ships , playing multiple characters , using turrets both space battles regular battles , all multiple things your characters make this game worth playing	1

i've through doom3 now three times . first time i didn't even cheat . i won't go into how great game it but stick few short comings . one , game started off perfect . little bit realism goes long way but later degraded into world comic bookish nightmareism ... skeletons missile launchers their shoulders come ! bugger man rocket launcher pace right hand .. aaah ! it isn't hard figure out why id it , they trying spice it up bit keep it interesting ... i understand , i just don't agree . two , no mass attacks monsters use up all your hard won ammunition . instead you transport our marine h-ll once more search find same things all over again -- all these games ! monster nazi helmet whip -- more comic book filler . three , game cheat every other room searched gets little irritating . you know monster other side darkened doorway . you throw dozen gernades there , monster isn't hurt . you take step forward , monster jumps out you blast it . then -- course -- monster which appeared out nowhere behind you , attacks . answer course walk backward , trip ' if then ' statment program , shoot monster behind turn around shoot one front -- your second attempt get through door . i get tired computer gamecheating because i makes me cheat beat game . i don't mind dark areas , whole base just went h-ll , i would expect lights not always work . four , i've heard those h-ll knights destroyed big green glowing plasma gun/cannon . well , i it thirty eight hand grenades ! game would -- i think -- better if two or three turn loose roam hallways looking humans munch randomly . five , basically , never enough fighting room . understandable station world pressurized atmosphere . rooms would all small . exploding barrels pressurized enviroment , what hoot ! yuck , yes i said yuck instead number , belted ammunition machineguns usually came 100 round belts -- not sixty . mini guns used chained belts -- i know , i use repair them . plasma gun munitions travel far too slow . shotgun needs longer barrel so it still choke keep pellets spread out too wide becoming useless after ten feet . handgrenades can't thrown properly . light machinegun firing rate half what it should ... goodiness sake , get some duck tape flashlight tape you weapon . list could go these ' little ' things ... but game easily worth money . remember , these mostly suggestions id future program	-1
i decided buy star wars republic commando xbox my son , because he won't let me play my pc version . come find out it seems like it plays easier xbox . this game far one best i've ever played . it awesome . i find it very exiting actually feels like part combat squad . everyone team knows pro-active , rather than reactive . i haven't seen game yet , where squad members react direct or indirect fire these commandos it . you don't move your team , they'll their job . you also redirect their orders they follow orders letter . able " inject " them bacta , makes game whole lot better just " finding med kit " , other hand , while you're injured , rescued your crew definitely gives you feeling you team !!! only regret ( just small one ) game so short ( or least it felt like it ) . it only three major campains , game so much fun , it seemed like time flew . i only hope lucasarts decides make republic commando ii ( maybe , based missions omega squad ) ... here hoping . i definintely recommend this game , squad-based combat or star wars fans alike , you'll get kick out it . i'm definintely fan " delta squad , republic commandos	1
after playing grand theft auto iii , i thought there no way rockstar could top themselves . fact , when advance word this game got out , i actually thought this nothing more than add-on gta3 . stupid thought , i know ; whole , gta : vc bigger , badder , more audacious than gta3 ever . so , here story : 1986 , tommy vercetti -- hitter forelli crime family liberty city -- finally released prison . sonny forelli , his boss , immediately sends him down vice city close major drug deal handled ken rosenberg , shyster lawyer forellis ' contact . no sooner deal closed than gunmen break it all up , kill everyone but tommy ken , take both drugs cash . now , tommy recover money sonny ... but before long , he decides make name himself this town . setting pure ' 80s excess , through through . if you take bottomless amoral corruption scarface , day-glo polyester fashion miami vice , innate cheesy greed ronald reagan 1980s american culture , you'll vice city . you'll see it fashion sense citizens , local architecture , cars tooling around road . you'll even hear it radio stations , which boast array heavy metal , dance , latino , bubblegum pop music like which you haven't even thought since ' 80s . i swear ; try listening one radio stations see if memories don't come flooding back . voice acting , usual , superb . ray liotta outstanding job bringing tommy vercetti life , making otherwise loathsome sociopath into strangely likable character . there others well ; burt reynolds , dennis hopper , gary busey , lee majors , fairuza balk , robert davi all turn great performances . but philip michael thomas , who played don johnson partner tubbs miami vice , gets special mention ; more ways than one , his character -- lance vance -- one keep eye . while main story missions only take up third game itself , it addition new feature not only rounds things out , it also adds length game , really makes you feel like you're establishing criminal empire . they're called asset properties . certain point game , you option buying certain businesses . once you buy one these asset properties , you complete its mission strand , business start generating daily amount money you pick up . some them perfectly legitimate , such taxi company or nightclub . others little sketchy , like boatyard or strip club , but others absolutely illegal , like protection rackets , " ice cream " company , or car showroom . they add great amount depth , they let you establish contacts across town . needless say , once sonny forelli comes town " check up " you , make no mistake ... he now your town . so , if you feel need get away it all indulge your inner tony montana , book trip vice city . like san andreas , it great place visit unwind ... also like san andreas , you'll glad you don't live there	1

nintendo dominated handheld industry since gameboy came out . now sony stepped , some predicted their hold might finally breaking . not so , there no better proof than ds lite . lite evolutionary step over original ds , similar gameboy advance sp . it more compact form factor , brighter screens , side-mounted power button , weighs less , longer battery life , simply looks more fashionable . basic functionality ds still here- same buttons general button layout , wi-fi , gba compatibility , etc . this worth buying if you already ds ? maybe , if you've got some spare cash . this worth buying if you don't own ds ? definitely . design far superior old ds . no ds review would complete without further mention psp . while psp undoubtedly more capable device , it significant weaknesses compared ds . particularly , psp games tend far longer load times , it much shorter battery life , hardware itself more fragile . oh , course , there cost . most critical factor , however , library games available . now , ds games more better , there simply no contest when it comes which more offer this department . games what really make or break console , wide variety excellent casual immersive ds titles make it clearcut winner .	1
mario luigi partners time me takes me back snes , first mario rpg " super mario rpg : legend seven stars " game i absolutely love ( would also recommend anyone snes or emulator ) . reason general gameplay this rpg hasn't changed . you move around different screens , attack enemies , fight bosses , etc . there definately unique ( i suppose you might consider it simplistic ) ideology this game follows . it easier version action/rpgs , you level up , battles aren't random ( you see enemies you engage screen ) though it turn-based . this game plays feels much like original legend seven stars , but added its own twists funny little story line make it , it own game . i highly recommend this game anyone who doesn't mind lot chatting , but even more action puzzles ! homerun mario rpgs	1

note : this review spoiler free regards game storyall good things must eventually come end , such star wars series , lord rings trilogy , jak daxter trilogy ( not including racing game daxter own psp game ) . after two excellent games , our favorite elfin friend his furry sidekick come last entry jak trilogy . big question : it good ending ? i'm pleased say overall , yes . jak 3 takes place undetermined time after conclusion jak 2 . haven city become divided after relentless attacks robots , metal heads other nasties . population blames jak these problems he finds himself flown out wasteland , harsh unforgiving desert where nobody survive without help . abandoned those he saved , jak his buddy daxter set out thier final adventure . like it two predecessors , jak 3 platforming game combined gun shooter . you get various jumps , kicks , punches leaps , you also get wide array firearms take out your foes when your fancy kung-fu karate aren't enough . jak moves remain largely unchanged jak 2 ( which now called j2 ) . he still punch like man , jump like kangaroo , leap like bullfrog . gunplay remains pretty much same well . you get four guns ( blaster , rifle , machine gun peacemaker ) , but nice twist , each weapon gets various upgrades game goes . rifle example , starts out it default setting . hower , next upgrade allows it shoot richochet bullets while third upgrade gives it flying platform shoots bullets all directions . each gun three upgrades playing them blast . peace maker example , fire shot paralyzes all enemies makes them float around ( whee ! ) while it final upgrade ... well , let just say you'll shooting mini-nukes lo t.t he biggest change jak game play comes form vehicles . while j2 flying vehicles zoomers , jak 3 cars ( not nice , talking pixar kind ) . because half game set desert , jak daxter get around dune buggies . there eight them each various unique traits . some really , really fast , one jump riddiculously high ( wheee ! ) some them spin out control slightest twitch control stick ( boo ! ) . you'll spending lot time driving buggies most part , it enjoyable fun , though some them ( such sand shark ) bit difficult handle . new feature jak 3 sheer size it . j1 j2 two enormous areas run around . here , you not one , not two , but three , yes , three ! gigantic areas run around . like previous games , there no loading times , astonishing feat considering how enormous both worlds ( spargus city , wasteland haven city ) . you'll definatly see lot amazing sights during your trips throughout jak 3 world ( such how haven city ... ahem ... changed since last game ) . dark jak powers return well , but now balanced new side our hero ... light jak . if dark jak attacking force , light jak defensive force . dark allows you kill things really quickly , while light allows you heal , fly ( this so awesome ! ) , surround yourself inpenetrable shield , even slow down time crawl . both powers activated any time long you light dark eco your meters . very nice touch , you stop light or dark touch button save your energy when you really need it . while both light dark come into play vital moments during gameplay , both really just little added bonus spice up gameplay when you want , you play throughout game without needing use either force ( except scripted moments where you need ) . but then again , able heal yourself whenever you want very handy thing ! * smile*like j2 , jak 3 you going place place , talking people doing what they tell you . when you finish , you head over next person what they want , etc . it linear system makes it easy tell where go what next it sounds fairly restrictive , but it one big strength : you don't start next mission until you want . if you want , you wander around wasteland blowing up wanderers twenty hours , go hunt down twelve precurser orbs watch sun go up down three times , then tackle mission . this free roaming system allows you what you'd like if you don't feel like doing missions while . one thing i'd like address before we go any further difficulty level . if one takes look my review j2 , one find lot anger hatred directed towards naughty dog making j2 most unnecessarily hardest game i've ever played ( it still way , tied only spider man ps2 ) . i am very pleased naughty dog towned down difficulty lot jak 3 . no longer each every mission require twenty attempts before you pass it , no longer you throwing controller into tv while screaming obscenities becuase a**hole errol won fricken race again . here , difficulty seems just right . not too hard , not too easy . most missions require few attempts before they completed , few finished one try . there still few quite difficult , one or two grit-your-teeth inducing , but overall , nothing infuriating many moments previous entry series . oh , there only few " go through ring " missions this time around . thank goodness . addition free-roaming gameplay , there also plenty secrets unlock this quest . there over 600 precurser orbs find collect jak 3 , doing so you get unlock various features such unlimited dark light jak power , invincibility , extra vehicles , various weapon upgrades , etc . while some hidden behind corners , many these orbs collected doing various challenges people throw your way , such searching around paticular area , going through rings ( grumbles ) , following little blue light even stopping time . there plenty things get those little shiny orbs , but results well worth it . addition , jak 3 arguably best moments series terms " wow " factor . fighting gigantic sixty story tall monster only dune buggy moment sends shivers down your spine . even all these fine points , jak 3 stutter little bit what arguably most important part game ... story . j2 most memorable me it story . it many twists turns you never really knew what expect next . story jak 3 good one it keep your interest what going happen next ... but ultimitly , it left me unsatisfied . how so ? three biggest ones charachters , precursers ending . those you worrying i'm going tell you who precursers ( which i won't ) i'm going keep this spoiler free i . first off , charachters . we jak daxter course , those two always fun watch care . we many returning charachters such torn , sig , samos , we some new residents spargus city . problem ? almost all returning charachters zilch charachter development . it assumed you know them last game because , jak 3 takes no time explain who they or what they . may okay , but pretty much none charachters expanded all . torn still gruff tough ( but not much last time ) , ashelin firm leader , samos gives warnings what may happen planet if things go badly . keira , who such vital charachter j1 j2 , absoloutly nothing story aside look pretty important . sig ... well , he just there because he cool . only returning charachter who kept me interested tess , who fufills " dumb blonde " role . her relationship daxter sweet lighthearted kept my interest easily . errol returns well ( though i won't say how ) , but he gone " insanely irritating " " average irritating " , sad departure his compellingly egotistic nature j2 . new charachters , only one , damos , kept my interest due his charachter . tough , yet gentle caring same time , he easily most compelling jak new companions . new villian , count veger , isn't compelling , though he some very powerful scenes ( especially one near ending ) . one claims back game box we'll discover shocking secret who precursers really . i said earlier , i won't reveal who precursers ( someone ruined suprise me ) , except my personal opinion , we should never find out who precursers leave them mystery . i personally felt seeing who they really sucked out all suspense mystery , esepcially since they talked length two games now . it like revealing face doctor claw . when you go back experience your old memories , there no more mystery or wonder anymore . my personal opinion , these beings should remained hidden forever . however , saddest part game me ending . again , i won't ruin it you , but it always sad when game developers wrap entire trilogy up three minutes . some people criticise ending film , return king , saying it goes too long . however , ending lord rings film trilogy took it time wrapping up threads three movies bringing closure story leaving one satisfied . however , jak 3 doesn't . game goes gets closer end , feeling dread idea everything destroyed just vanishes pretty much gone time final boss battle comes ( sadly , battle itself isn't exciting or memorable ) . ending end trilogy , but leaves door wide open more games ( which two already happened ) . i've invested lot time these three games , i've grown attatched it charachters i would like closure all thier stories . saldy , doesn't happen . everything left wide open when , my opinion , it should closed . there no real ending here , least , one ties everything up nicely . but despite my points story , i want stress jak 3 very good game . it satisfying blend storytelling , platforming , shooting , driving , action . it one those games where you keep saying " just five more minutes , just five more minutes " , only discover time flown it two morning . it addictive , fun , , me , blast play . i definitly recommend it , especially if you find it under twenty dollars	-1

i know i'm little late , but what heck ? i felt like writing review this game . final fantasy just fantastic game . simple . its extremely deep , fantastic story , great characters , great battle system , it perfect length rpg ( 45-55 hours ) . not everyone likes tidus , he honestly doesn't bother me , i think he interesting character . rest cast well developed , they all interesting personalities distinct this universe . cast very memorable , you'll remember them years come , i think speaks volumes how good this game . its enhanced usual good voice acting square known , so doesn't disapoin t.t he gameplay extremely fun , its actually one my favorite battle systems . battle system make or break rpg , this one doesn't disappoint . its fast paced , so it doesn't get bogged down long battles . you also swap characters mid battle , thats awesome feature . gameplay also incredibly deep , i've heard people literally pouring hundreds hours into this game . so if thats your thing , i'm sure you've probably already played this game . if some reason you not played this game your into rpg , don't hesitate pick this game up , its cheap now , its one best most balanced rpg i've ever played	1

i am huge fan world war 2 first person shooters . i've genre since begining medal honor . since then , not too much more impresive me than call duty . it wonderfual game still . call duty 2 even better . this new game maintain stellar streak series ? word , yes . although , it alot more same . but then again , why mess great formula ? call duty 3 works because it exactly what original game built around , sheer intensity .... also alot fun . but then you might say , well i've played cod2 , you saying its same ? yes no . basic mechanics same few newly added gameplay elements little nothing overall game so escense . yea , its same game . but this time around levels bigger look o so much prettier . honestly , these some most amazing visuals xbox 360 . i dare say it puts my beloved cod2 near shame . lighting texturing beautiful explosions heart stopping behold . life like graphics complimented brilliant musical score . oh , if anyone should wonder ingame soundeffects , just pop previous call duty game imagine it amped up even more . seriously , battlechatter never so nicely integrated . cod3 yet amazing world war 2 game certainly keep veterans genre happy content , meaning edge your seat . newly implimented rag doll physics destructable enviroments make sure you stay there too . i reccomend this game anyone everyone who played world war two first person shooter enjoyed it because what we here ladies gentelmen latest greatest , best money buy	1
i just got this game thursday i'm already disc 2 . this my first time ever playing final fantasy game i'm glad i picked number 9 . i won't spoil anything telling any story , but i tell you game amazing . graphics great there best i've ever seen ps1 game . i love characters , i'd say vivi my favorite then next would zidane , but really i love them all . playing final fantasy 9 made me wanna buy other games play them too . buy this game , you won't regret it .	1
i've dvd players come go , so its kinda cool gaming console plays dvd too . yeah , i know ps2 capability without remote , i one those too . but one cool things i noticed box playback kit remote looks just like ones made rca . i tried few controls dvd funtion my rca universal remote , low behold it worked . kinda hand thing , i've got many remotes floting around it , so part nice . mine works great , i use it instead re-arrange my already overpacked entertainment center put my other dvd player .	1
several years , several sequels , passed now , so gta iii really worth time ? i'd definitely say so . this game continues incredibly fun years later . you pick it up just play or you advance through stories . each engaging creative , just like sequels . when it comes down it , this great game it still holds its weight against sequels knock off games . it definite buy	1
i liked ssx series , sequel 3 best , but i didn't play racers . i bought first nfsu disliked choppy animation . i got part two just out curiosity i liked it so much i beat game . basically , you newbie bayview city you race different type races build rep your car . you must tune your car each type race you must check shops frequently . there various shops , visual effect paint shops ones which improve your car speed , handling etc . races also different : you races isolated tracks , races live trafic , street races confined cramped space without nitro option , lot dirty driving hitting ; short tracks which you win if you shift gear time , my favorites , drift races , which you win if you get most points , not if you pass line first . drift races won breaking steering order make long trail . i used automatic shifting i set game difficulty easy since i don't play racers . i 93 percent i got into race which unmarked map . it 6 circuit race against boss final one . some advice beginngers : if you can't find races map , go garage check out world map option you'll get list all races per level . if you beat them can't find any more races , upgrade your car or get some stars visual rating getting ' cosmetics ' ( new parts like spoilers , lights , new paint ) you'll get offer magazine cover or dvd . if you still stuck , cruise town find unmarked races	-1
this fun game , only thig i say i wish ps2 or sony could web site where you download current rosters , next seasons games . it kinda sucks , if i want play next season i guess i go out buy madden 2007 updated rosters	1
i enjoyed this game quite bit -- i ended up putting all other games i playing aside just finish this one . you play three baudelaire kids . story follows 2004 lemony snicket film fairly closely , you must first escape count olaf decrepit mansion , then avoid killed train before you head off uncle monty herpetology paradise , aunt josephine seaside town , finally save violet baudelaire fate worse than death . environments attractive fun explore , game play puzzles neither too easy nor too challenging frustrating . most game -- you explore environments , solve puzzles , search secret rooms such , you switch violet klaus baudelaire you please . many " important " events , such boss fights , you must play one or other , they each different skills weapons . some sequences -- those basically 2d platformer sections ( entire game some platformer aspects , but it usually loosely employed 3d ) , you must play sunny , baby baudelaire ( this only time you play her ) . various puzzles challenges -- they almost amount series " mini-games " , varied mostly non-repetitive , helping retain your interest . some fairly easy figure out perform , but some appropriately more challenging , both mentally terms manipulating controller , take many tries complete . couple first-person shooter sequences ( game mostly third person mode ) , especially challenging , particularly end , but that final boss fight , so that expected . like most games , winning boss fights requires discerning patterns bosses adapting strategy appropriate pattern , which takes both brains manual dexterity . there couple negatives game , but they minor . games like this , released response success film , often rushed through production . becomes evident here cut scenes , which not very exciting -- they feature 2d black white sketches more like slide show major portions story read us . but i'd rather skimping cut scenes than game play , that just what here . also , although graphics wonderful most part , visuals bit dark overall -- i found it best play lights off . bright overhead light , glare too much see important information game . finally , i would preferred different save game scheme , you only save when game asks if you want , save points seem almost random . sometimes you save after accomplishing only one more minor task . sometimes you long sequences ( sometimes number challenging ones ) before you save again . game isn't quite funny film doesn't exactly same " magical " atmosphere , but it engaging fun journey world . soundtrack , jeremy julian soule , inspired thomas newman great soundtrack film , also major asset -- i found myself wanting explore levels again later much hear music again anything else	1
i never purchased ncaa football game until this one , i must say i am happy i . i love college feel it brings table . playing texas ohio state game horseshoe crowd going nuts screen shaking awesome !!! i see lot people complaining fact throwing long passes just too easy , but i ask if anyone ever watches college football saturdays ? this exactly what happens week week out college football . reason there more than twice many talented wide outs than there corners college football i feel accurately portrayed this game . i don't any gripes this game except fact rush heisman mode you automatic starter no matter what program you go , you don't ability change depth charts except when game start you this before every game . all all this great game because it my madden 06 disc collecting dust my entertainment center	1
this headset works very well . if you're not used rubber in-canal ear piece , there several other tips bit less intrusive . it worked quite well limited amount time i've used it xbconnect . but price ! you could probably buy similar plantronics headset would compatable communicator cartridge-adapter ( which isn't included this package ; you buy it seperately ! ) , but not designed specifically xbox less than half this price . i very fortunate find two circuit city they discontinued recently five bucks piece ! maybe amazon soon drop price like everyone else ...	1

quite simply , it great , though bit challenging side . gorgeous art style some great music come together atmospheric title , one , despite it ' rated ' ' everyone ' approach , appeal adults well kids . it not without some light frustration , but good far outweighs bad . ignore mediocre reviews pick this one up . replay value four different cases , well some unlockable minigames ' touch ' list . if you like adventure titles like phoenix wright trace memory ( or maniac mansion , matter ) then you'll really dig this game . good solid four stars	-1
this game great . can't wait god war 2	1
movie tie-ins usually rather tiresome affair . they sell bundles units more often than not large pile mediocrity . godfather game different . obviously it made back unparalleled success francis ford coppolla gangster masterpiece . it sell this reason well . however , godfather game it own place epic narrative . it would easy ea put player shoes michael corleone - main protagonist movies . indeed , it may due failure securing license use al pacino voice likeness forced ea hand creating fresh perspective famous storyline . what we're left new take featuring your good self ; narrative sees you seamlessly weave out events loyal film . example , when luca brasi stabbed through hand garrotted - start first movie - you look event through window , you're spotted scene turns into revenge mission . it expertly executed you feel part story genuine loyal film . violence superbly recreated also . realistic nature firearms godfather makes interesting gameplay . you might used rather `cartoonish ' gunplay saint row gta , godfather might first seem unforgiving . it . but it realistic - take one bullet close range you're sleeping fishes ... it simple . conversely your own guns carry same clout , so shootouts often become intense challenging affairs , if little frustrating . where gta gun fighting success dependent how quickly you change targets get your shots off , godfather sees you picking your shots timing runs cover . it obvious ea development focussed heavily walking shooting parts game , this where most appeal lies . driving however different affair altogether . given nature godfather ea limited what isn't possible driving sections . physics cars mean they frustrating play . most vehicles slow faster cars seem unnaturally quick . handbrake turns work so well gta irritatingly difficult pull off , especially when chased coppers . cars bounce off kerbs but smash right through lampposts practically unaffected . other vehicles , however , seemingly made concrete . also , getting one way point times tedious - gta gets round this superbly scripted radio stations , but godfather doesn't such ingenuity - you're instead treated violin-based soundtrack depressing once novelty runner . valid excuse most this isn't ea fault - this more or less what it like drive car ' them days ' . there no radio ; cars lame , classic , but moved like pair concrete boots . where violence so real , so must rest game if only consistency . you would expect much what you directed storyline . however there provisions those who more impulsive . outside missions there businesses extort rackets take over . doing such build your weekly wage , which you then turn spend clobber sorting your hair out . you respect bar increases each completed mission , but coolly this isn't only way gain kudos amongst fellow gangsters . buying nice wise guy suit brings plaudits boosts respect meter much whacking guy . each time your character levels up you get point allocate his attributes . it bit weak rpg element , but worth thinking when acquiring garments . extorting businesses tricky , but worth effort . you'll usually take out two or three ' bad guys ' before able get owner . when you situation requires thought . essentially you need scare businessman into paying , you so finding his or her ' limit ' . so while some owners agree ' protection ' soon you ask , others battered brink death . pretty sick , but then life gangster isn't fairies . warned though , going over top or killing proprietor render business inactive while you'll get nothing but bruised set knuckles . it fantastic sidetrack main game taken seriously if you want hire muscle buy more powerful weapons later missions . so you've got two sections same game sit paradoxically each other . superbly well balanced combat game play forces you thoughtful timely . very dodgy vehicle part frustrates bores more than anything else . it difficult review sandbox game without making comparison gta , although it slightly unfair so godfather given rules imposed subject matter . it very best it delivers gritty realism , but same realistic token , it times terribly dull . it difficult dislike godfather ea so faithful everything we loved films - but this undoing game also . it would forgivable exaggerate gameplay places order make it more entertaining . but godfather game purists order please it feel genuine , godfather certainly .	-1
chrono cross , which semi sequel 1995 chrono trigger , cant even come close its former games plateua . chrono trigger arguably greatest rpg ever created . so while chrono cross ' not good ' it still whole heck lot things righ t.t he gameplay , story , battles this game all top notch . its fun get handle over numerous tough boss battles this game because elemental magics strategic system . black beats white red beats blue , etc . its always fun interesting see what next dungeon or boss offer . gameplay never sluggish always keep you your toes . also , when you beat game you option replay entire game again all your beefed up characters before . if things going slow you speed them up fast forward button your second play through game . truly brilliant ! so why this game get 4 out 5 if it so darn good ? because its confusing/tedious magic system over abundance characters . most magics summons this game joy watch behold their might . but this game there no magic points you must ' equip ' every single magic spell you . could mean 50+ spells equip per character ! setting up each character late game take upwards 5-10 minutes easily . each spell only cast once per battle unless you buy multiples spell . probably games worst point its ridiculous amount characters . chrono trigger something like 7 recruitable characters you play , each their own terrific unforgettable personalities . chrono cross 44 recruitable characters . 95% your 40+ characters personality wood stool . some characters literally say ' i join your party ' than join never say anything else ever again ! 44 playable characters instead 7 spreads each one way too thin makes them all lose individuality . end this game still one greatest rpgs ever made first playstation . while its few flaws keep it true classic , it still one greatest rpg experiences past 5 years .	1

i said , i blue ds , it great ! i don't any big fancy words describe it , but it durable-dropped many times-works just good day i got it , 5 or so games it-nintendo dogs , new super mario , mario vs donkey kong march minis , monopoly ( gameboy advance)-oh yeah it ga compatible , mario kart , some other crazy game my husband liked , anyway , buy extra pens if you children-they get lost quickly , it wireless so you use it against ds ( nintendo dogs game senses other dog owners you hook up play their dog ) . easy use , it handheld-i weary fact you your hands so close together small screen , but i never problem it , unless you play new super mario bros i t-t hen your thumbs begin cramp because addiction game . battery life good well , it last charge long while , 3-4 days without charge if you play it only few hours day . several games good ones ( read some my game reviews ) . overall , go out get one , your whole family love it !	1
i played many nfs series . this one nfs hot pursuit 2 best . me , this game would not very playable regular gamepad . i purchased logitech force feedback pro wheel it makes all difference . precise control . game takes whole new level realism . you get much better feel how different cars react . game get progressively harder . getting blacklist easy , getting number 1 not . some milestones ridiculously hard , but it awesome when you finally get past them . i wish i bought black edition , but regular one good hours hours fun . i would say there decent level replay-ability it too	1

i'm 36 years old i played many football video games many different consoles over years i must say this game stands out above all rest ! there " zillion " college teams choose ! stadiums beautifully detailed ! players , coaches , referee models , their animations , superb ! when playing stadium natural grass surface your players get grass mud stains their uniforms ! friend mine my workplace this game longer than i says occasionally player helmet fly off after big hit ! i yet see it happen but i'm looking forward it ! crowds look sound truly alive ! fans celebrate hold up signs ! cheerleaders even teams ' mascot look fantastically detailed their celebrations exciting ! espn college gameday crew , brad nessler , lee corso , kirk herbstreit provide interesting funny game commentary some but not much repetitiveness ! it pretty cool when corso makes his winning pick gameday booth before game he wearing either his picks ' mascot head or teams football helmet he speaking ! overall gameplay great learning curve fairly easy especially if you're familiar madden series ! ncaa 2006 you adjust your game settings , etc . any way you like reset them default touch button!i'm not much into all different options many sports games such creating teams , players , playbooks , making coaching decisions such ( although you all this game ); i play solely visual atmospheric stimulation which this game particular provides ! my opinion ncaa football 2006 blows other football titles out water it total package ! football fans , get this game !!! you feel like you involved actual college football game complete all emotion pageantry ! you become addicted it you want play it over over again !	1

this game great . i mean it might just like last years game all , but still it pretty cool . i like graphics . they don't show great detail , but they suffice . new momentum meter nothing special . it doesn't help you or anything . it just tells you who doing better game . new emotions expressed players really helps you know tempo game . one thing sort con this year campus legend mode . that really only reason i bought this game . i really don't like college football team well enough franchise it . i like csu though , so i might try it . but anyway , campus legend mode lets you normal thing . pick your position instence . you get lots drills your position this year . good some , bad most . also , you pick major . what up ? i mean , college football rough enough but study major ? unbelieveable . then they expect you remember all stuff you studied take two tests it each year . i got so frustrated i failing chemistry i started write all answers down . so i'm doing better now . trust me though , this game fun play random games your college team or guess franchise your favorite college team , but please , if you want make all-star football player , just go out but ncaa football 2006 . way more easier	1
this game long time making , given cultural popularity western genre , it surprising western-themed video game should take so long come market . i this game long time , but only recently got play it , when i finally got into it , it enormously entertaining i loved lot spaghetti-western themed humor musical score . game , you control variety characters ( many whom introduced superb opening sequence , which plays much like opening credits sergio leone western ) . most time , you play part red harlow , half-breed bounty hunter mission hunt down his parents ' murderers . ( sound familiar ? ) you'll also get chance control variety other western archetypes , such expert pistoleer english dandy , sharpshooting , spitfire rancher daughter , indian cousin red harlow ( who dresses like iroquois instead sioux or other plains indian - but i'm nitpicking ) , negro buffalo soldier , you even get play bad guy when you assume role renegade mexican general . gameplay itself took little time get used . instance , draw your gun , you must press button down , keep it held down while pressing button shoot . if you let go button which draws your gun , your character holster his gun again . this one quirks which made initially difficult learning curve . however , once controls mastered , combat actually surprisingly easy . you duck , hide behond cover , dive/roll , jump . when guns holstered , you even punch kick - one my favorite sequences whole game bar brawl ( more stereotypical western scenes ! ) where you cannot use your guns , but must use fists feet ( occassionally broken whiskey bottles ) fight your way safety . addition " normal " combat , there " showdown " mode which dedicated quick-drawing against one or more opponents . highlight this feature " tournament " ( which seems inspired movie " quick dead " ) where you battle ever-faster enemies until you win . this mode sometimes very frustrating you may replay again again . overall , graphics okay - what helps make this title fact makers put grainy , old-style matinee look ( like game movie played old-style ( worn out ) projector , complete hairlines picture moving off-center times . this little touch very endearing . while this title may not lot replay value , it still immensely fun i would recommend it highly .	1
this game rivals battlefront 2 all time greatest star wars game ver made . this game very similar halo its 1st person concept w/ hud . every level different lots strategic tasks . graphics gameplay awsome . i can't wait this game 360 compatible .	1

great uncomplicated game decent graphics just right amount quot ; spookinessquot ; . i loved puzzles which weren't overly difficult solve hint system very very good helping me get over one or two puzzles which not seem make sense . marble-in-the-hole game little irritating but all other puzzles solvable even trial error basis . this game probably not people who like complex plots puzzles but game novice i enjoyed it little disappointed when game ended ( little abruptly ! )	-1
i read previous reviews other reviews this games , i agree some disagree others . i like whole story line game . it gave us insight into history jr gaignun shion . i very disappointed overall combat system . i liked changing characters middle combat like ff-x , but i miss ability hit enemies special weapons like first episode . i also disappointed way creators changed way build characters first episode second . i liked characters different abilities . it added diversity building strong team . i didn't care too much good samaritan side quests . i didn't like go all over place pick up stuff vital development my characters or advance game . ability two characters attack during combat using special attacks interesting even though i didn't use it much . far characters themselves , i agree reviewer shion . i also found her bossy cold . certain scenes , i found her too emotional . most her lines near end completely out place especially end after jr showdown albedo . ( i disappointed when my most favorite npc gaignun possessed , but that just me . ) i agree one reviewer voice momo although i like some her lines . i very happy creator took away her wand give her weapon . it made her very useful combat . chaos too laid back me this game kos-mos too much vain side . i like how reaction shion jin or kos-mos before combat starts . overall game enjoyable play . once i got pass disappointing aspects game , i found it very entertaining	-1
... graphics pretty imbarasing . object game get snapshots you get these snapshots completing missions , levels , hero times ( specific mission you use one character ) . some levels fun , like far , far , away level(it grand theft auto theme ) . i give graphics 3/5 ( i think they should better job main characters ) , audio 4/5 , gameplay 4.5 /5 , fun 4.5 /5 , overall 3/5 .	-1
i saw ad city life i clicked it . i read it thought it sounded so much better than sim city 4 ( which i currently own ) i decided download try demo . demo so much fun , it many features . what gives this game unique twist social cliques . you meet needs each cliques , example different types jobs they need . what makes it realistic , it just like real life . blue collars dont want live next fringes , whereas rich don't want live next poor , or homeless . what supprised me most this game though 3d graphics . you zoom out get eye level " people " you see them reading paper their picnic table their backyard , or walking down street , or taking trash out . neat feature how easy it zone . zoning such improvement over sc4 . this game makes you auctually get involved your community , making it your perfect town . now all i am waiting my copy game come . 1- least ........................... 10-bestgraphics : 8simplicity : 9fun : 10realistic : 9overall great game those who tired waiting sc5 or , those who just starting out city simulation games	1
if you aren't daunted little detail turn-based strategy game , you don't mind graphics fall short quot ; latest eye candy testquot ; , you're willing spend some time bringing yourself up learning curve , you'll love this game . if you find any above 3 make you doubt , you probably shouldn't get it . but me , turn-based strategy junky core , this game absolute gem . probably best i've bought last 5 years . specific niche gamer out there , this one extraordinary	1
this very entertaining game . it isn't one action packed varieties but it given me hours enjoyment without pressure shot . it not everyone but if you like master basic economics building city it fun	1

lemony game not hardcore gamers . it doesn't aspire . it shouldn't compared warcraft or resident evil 4 . game developed amaze activision . any one familiar first three harry potter movie o-o rdinated games ( through electronic arts ea games ) familiar amaze . first three potter games fun bit challenge children those adults who new pc gaming . player wandered around magical world hogwarts , collecting jelly beans wizard cards . what fun not completeing tasks or learning new magic , what fun freedom discover new areas find secret places . fans potter games recognize same mechanics gameplay outfitted new location , jelly beans replaced golden eyes , golden hearts refuel stamina instead chocolate frogs , playbills letters granted instead wizard cards . players also recognize flavor wonderful score game set , enjoyable , appropiate , but not overbearing some familiar notes . lemony isn't quite good aforementioned potter games . reason lemony not fun story . while ficticious , lemony story relentless abuse three very droll very wealthy orphans . its much more fun play boy , who left his abusive aunt uncle behind , entering magical world educated hogwarts . i rather enjoyed learning how fly buckbeak prizoner azkaban . lemony , i'm rather relieved i solved train signal puzzle , thought children run over over over train until i , depressing me . yet , lemony provide some consolation those who disappointed ea latest potter offering , goblet fire . while there adjustment droll circumstances , task discovering your world take over game eventually command your attention . while lemony isn't bad , it isn't good , either . they renderings children not most flattering they could , villians boorishly ugly . gameplay controls aren't half good potter games , they weren't greatest . there match game puzzle cellar , only shows up per every install , instead every game . i complete it nothing happened my game , which maybe reason puzzle won't show up rest games particular installation . it this twice me , i'm not going uninstall install third time see if it happens again . it no effect my score or letter or eye collecting . camera angles aren't well mapped shooting . i supposed shoot rat , but camera got behind ceiling lamp , while rat biting me , all i could see inside lamp shade . suff like . still its better than most children games out there , it plays ! you may guessed , there violence . when i shoot rat lemony , it shot rotten egg lobber . rotten eggs your bullets , player stuns enemies , instead killing them . time . i've played lemony three times , third time it going through motions . once few skills jumping , aiming egg lobber , boot puncher mastered , there wasn't any interest left . but time i play , i enjoy it . games amaze category unto themselves . they not action games based trigger finger , nor they point click boring adventure games beset brain teaser puzzles futuristic world . they relaxing time where you don't test your brain , just delight it . if you never played potter games new pc gaming i recommend lemony , it good place start . if you fellow potterhead felt betrayed buy goblet fire , lemony sustain you .	-1
i'm not going into storyline , becuase it obivously spoil it those who haven't oppurtunity play this excellent game . final fantasy first game final fantasy series released playstation 2 . graphics here sharp crisp , no fuzzness or distortions . voice actors actually good job , doesn't sound like those old kung-fu movies where tone voices ] don't match person appearnace . battle system simple use they offer tutorials within menu case you're still confused . i'm really pleased results i see myself playing this game over over again	1
late 04 i decided give purchase gaming system time original xbox . not real dedicated gamer previously only played ( never owned ) systems i little knowledge how it'd upon use -- but since halo 2 just released rave reviews i knew i try it out ( hey , it halo , people ! ) . man , i glad i invested it ! it bit large ( compared my best friend ps2 ) bit difficult lug someplace , but graphics much better than ps2 games available it great ( significantly critically acclaimed halo series , course , best game out there my opinion ) . there some issues how bulky system but it quality gaming rather than how bulky gaming system	1
