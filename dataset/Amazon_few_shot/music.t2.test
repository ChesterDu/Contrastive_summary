i never able see what big deal this band . all their records , general , sound exactly same , this one no exception . post-velvets guitar/organ drones , lackadaisical vocals , blankly uninteresting non-lyrics ( they could recited their grocery lists it would more interesting ) , dramatic lack energy ; all yo la tengo trademarks fully represented here , if you stay awake through it , you're better man/woman than i . surpassingly boring record , even this usually very boring band . if you've heard velvet underground , neu !, stereolab early records , sonic youth , you've heard yo la tengo total . if you're big enough fan those named bands , you could probably write songs sound like quot ; painful . quot ; but you would probably write better ones . avoid this like plague unless you suffer insomnia	1
even joke , this would horrible ; however , i think this band take it seriously - it blows ! i picked up this cd because i heard a.r.e. like combination suicide , front 242 , iron maiden : interesting . no !! a.r.e. bad imitation front 242 watered-down liars best . guitar riffs awful lyrics even worse . example : " hey world " begins how much it sucks 13 . when i saw pelican concert , they opening (?!?!?) a.r.e. , so i decided give them second chance . sound guy must not liked what he heard , because bar chatter louder . " louder " i yelled , so i might find something redeeming their music . " yeah , suck louder ! " someone else yelled - i agree give him high-five . maybe i would liked this when i 12 didn't know any better . zero stars	-1
i tried listen samples songs you them all wrong . i click one song get list . what gives anyway	-1
this third time i tried post review this unacceptably bad album , i suppose i too harsh , because neither my previous efforts posted . lets keep this one simple . this not music , plain simple . i purchased this due glowing recommendations other reviewers this site , terribly disappointed . it basically consists massively distorted ( detuned ) guitar bass monotonously droning nearly hour no coherence , structure , or anything approximating actual ability play instrument . call it performance art , experimental noise , whatever . it simply not music .	-1
real , you gotta give this man props . i repect him his music , but it not my style . he still managed make this good album , so it all good . much repect .	1

maria callas known one greatest artist century because she responsible revival neglected bell canto operas . april 14 , 1957 one those memorable days . it opening night new production great neglected opera anna bolena . this staged la scala . i am very happy this particular event documented this recording . least able listen this spectacular memorable night . characterization la divina one most exciting she . this probably because anna tragedy comes fusion all wounded characters she played previously . this seems catalyst she needed pour deep emotions role . final scene this recording make everybody understand why la divina considered greatest singing actress 20th century . it shows her height her talent both tragic actress course singer . despite poor recording untolerable hisses some parts . this recording should not missed any reason this best anna bolena disc .	1
everytime same discussion ... when horner-haters let go ? yes i admit ... some sections this score sound little like titanic , some others sound like braveheart ... but so what ????? this one his most incredible soundtracks up date : listen very well , aura around all these tracks different than his past works you feel it after few listens ... again , yes sounds similar ... but it james horner sound ... 4 note ascending motif , female subdued voice , shimmering piano notes ethereal vocal pad ... it him you'll hear it many his works but ... it job . this one gem ... very emotional , beautiful mysterious same time ... great song performed hayley westenra ... should nominated oscars . i really feel we hear horner best stuff near future . thanks mr. horner great score (****) .	1

este album llego mi por simple curiosidad en el 2000 . nunca imagine que alguien pudiese juntar tal talento en sus manos voz como lo hizo muddy para este album . la seccion de musicos que le sirven de soporte son nada mas nada menos que . buddy guy willie dixon . no hay palabras que puedan describir la magia que emanan de estas grabaciones , tan solo blues en su mas puro estado ... es como trasladarse al delta de los 1930 . sonido puro llanamente acustico con un entramado de guitarras magistral entre muddy buddy guy que sirven de fondo la ya famosa interpretacion vocal de muddy eso sin contar con el solido sonido de willie dixon al bajo . recuerdo que en una vieja revista de blues apuntaba sobre la existencia de este disco como una muestra de musica folk interpretada por quien se supone fue , es sera la mejor voz guitarra del blues americano ... pero aqui no hay nada de folk , es blues delta en su estado mas primitivo . maravilloso dotado de una sencillez total que asombran por el resultado ; pura magia . se agregan una serie de bonus tracks que no deslucen del contenido inicial de la edicion original ... pero los temas grabados en acustico son seran la parte central de esta obra unica en su genero . las fotografias que se incluyen en el inserto en la propia caja del cd demuestran por su elegancia el disfrute de tres maestros del blues que nunca imaginaron que al juntarse para esta sencilla grabacion , crearian una de las mejores muestras del espiritu del blues delta . el album recoje algunos de los temas mas interesantes de la discografia del mudddy ; captain captain , good morning little school girl , long distance callin ' ... ademas de otras gemas cargadas de sentimiento la belleza del blues en un estilo unico donde predomina la improvisacion la tecnica espontanea de dos de los grandes guitarristas bluseros de todos los tiempos . puede debe catalogarse de grabacion escencial para todo amante de la musica el blues ... no dudes en obtenerla ... nunca dejaras de escucharlo , de lo contrario no sabes de lo que te pierdes . saludos	1

this record opens haunting version " girl north country , " which dylan sings johnny cash . haunting sure , because any song sung mr. cash haunting , but this one , dylan using his new countrified voice even more so , spooky . this song alone worth buying album . " girl " followed instrumental " nashville skyline rag , " which i've heard said reworking instrumental " cough song , " which first appeared " stealin '" bootleg . i don't know if that true , but it doggone good guitar piece . , course , everybody knows " lay lady lay " which kind top forty hit still played classic rock stations all over world . it good song , but i like " i threw it all away " " tonight i'll staying here you , " better . this country album . " john wesley harding " its country musicians leaned way , but " nashville skyline " got all way there dylan would stay country two more records ( some would say three ) , then he'd burst back rock scene vengeance . still , country or not , this five star piece work . yes , dylan country , but he it very , very well . jack priest , writer darksid	1
its funny : i'm same age sophia coppola i seemed missed out some great 80s music . i never listened siouxsie banshees bow wow wow . strange how music this so hypnotic --- it choice music itself ? or it visceral association film ? girl who wrote here it sounds like its coming down hall spot . combining lavish past film contrasting it contemporary pop music master stroke ( reminds me bit how sally potter seamlessly combined past present movie , orlando ) . second disc such wonderful addition --- again , seemingly incongorous match first second disc comes off brilliant . i found myself imagining movie so vividly when listening these tracks .	1
ignorance count excuse such drivel ? i wonder times ... refute " criticism : de sabata no need " rush opera " because 1953 they no more " time-problems " . his tempi legendary , if you want dragged tosca , go karajan-recording ricciarelli . (!) callas doesn't " scream all times " ( grammar ? ) but sings soaring pianissimi , . . phrase " ah come la sai bene l'arte di farti amare " or " fa le occhi neri ... " . she sounds velvety cantilenae " pianissimis " : learn italian first before you abuse this term ! super-high-charged ? gobbi sing " te deum " over 30 times until legge de sabata satisfied , callas positioned different places " mario ! " calls , they worked over half hour one phrase alone : " et avanti lui tremava tutta roma ! " this so thought through recording it absolutely mesmerizing . get your grammar work before you write any reviews all before you bash legend : your homework ! this tosca nothing less but brilliant . sadly reviewers such these only bring sown amazon.com	1
this cd combines professional singing children participating , which fascinates my toddler . it very useful hear youngsters ' voices alongside adults ' . also , good mix music - traditional nursery rhymes ; country western ; folk , etc . overall , 4 cds entertainment that kept my child very happy indeed !!	1
it hard not speak hyperbolically this record , because it simply stunning beautiful . it subtle , natural grace found few other places , especially within hardcore/emo genres . restraint , fury , beauty , vvvrrrroooommmm gazing into stars . i know it sounds lame like typical fan reviewers ' over-the-top , gushing cliche , but this record one very rare few deserves it . hopesfall very , very much very little . true instance minimalism = expansion/layered texture . just buy it . every single song overgrow you like intoxicating kudzu ( if you any taste )	1
i disappointed some songs this cd , particularly one willie nelson . ray willie rendition " seven spanish angels " would much better selection this cd than what they . i skip song when listening cd . he nora jones fabulous job well he gladys knight , he bb king . cd worth those three songs .	-1
there some classic songs this album sure . 6 them exact . all bee gees songs . sure " disco inferno " pretty good . so " if i can't you " . but everything else joke . if you ask me , they should've given whole record bee gees them like 10-12 songs . if they could come up 4 songs like ones they've got here , this would easily one greatest albums ever	1
joan jett not released official world wide release album 12 years . there couple unofficial releases over years but they only came out japan ( naked fetish which actually more collection her more sexualized songs ) . her new album sinner sees her re-releasing/re-recording some tracks off naked well some new cuts off fetish addition some new material . how it stack up ? pretty good actually . while album doesn't quite hold up quite well lot her classic 80 material , most part , this release sees joan venturing forth her trademark sound , tough ( sexy ) vocals , sexually ambiguous lyrics kicking guitar work . considering she not 48 years old , it literally sounds like she hasn't aged all . her backing band sounds great well . production crystal clear everything really nice rocking bite it . while some hardcore fans might upset they already some these songs already naked fetish , more casual fan like myself , this album really enjoyable listen . there only 2 or 3 cuts bit fillerish , but overall , this just great no-nonsense rock album like lot people don't make anymore . while this album doesn't really advance her sound any , it still shows her doing what she best when she really puts her mind/heart it . i recommend getting this her greatest hits cd fit tied that'll pretty much all joan jett you'll need . hopefully she won't take 12 years come out release . sinner shows this sexy woman still quite lot say .	1
superb performance superb sonics . close live performance high-end system one could ever expect	1
if you're looking original versions black classics like " smokie " or white silver sands , " stay away this cd ! all so-called hits presented this cd stereo re-recordings original mono hits ; i suspect most them recorded long after bill black death 1965 . new recordings same arrangements old ones , great sound , but feeling originals totally gone . stay away this cd	-1
i came across ani difranco music through covers guitar slinging folk girls , woman who quite good what they honored their influences . then i listened knuckle down , just last year . i like , oh , so this ani difranco . all-powerful amazon warrior , not just some sniveling girl ( quote girl herself , all irony intended ) . needs . , i think , what educated guess : needs , needs not met , needs expose us , , finally , make or break us . if you're fan difranco , you should appreciate this disc . it plays like workshop , working through themes ideas her ani accents , language , music , etc . educated guess shows artist work some heavy emotional stuff , personal themes still open-ended enough let listener . i think disc knuckle down sides whole emotional/creative gestalt . what she voices educated guess presented much more stylistcally knuckle down , more accomplished release only because she band jams polished material bit emotional distance . educated guess working through , feeling your way artist . origami articulates succinctly what went down this girl heart . powerful , accomplished woman surely find it difficult someone . other person complete you some way , , well , we know story . animal sweet swipe our fatted-calf way life . really , you hear difranco politics stated clearly , quietly , beautifully . you each time ends ani voice looping back through like delicate heartbeat goes after music all else dies . if there one thing you take this release it ani voice , looping out all variety echos choruses . she sings herself questions herself answers herself . her voice worked through effects whacked way she uses perfectly knuckle down . it all here , creative tools stuff she uses knuckle down , her mature masterpiece . she certainly working , experimenting here , pushing herself artist not avert her glance . she hard other her lyrics , yeah , but hard herself because , you know , when it just doesn't work out , what you then . very internal , this stuff , dark times smothering . discovering you , actually , happy either way , after it all goes down , love love thing , problematic most anyone . effects love loss life . taken together educated guess knuckle down show artist spiritual emotional crisis share sort creative catharsis . this definitely mature work . educated guess workshop , knuckle down showpiece . but any ani difranco fan should appreciate educated guess . i guess it might depend why you listen her . she smart lyricist sly guitarist , doing very cool , jazzy runs picks . don't expect world conqueror here . this human ani defeat , emotional wounds exposed , keeping company herself , working through groovy way . accompanied her guitar ever looping voice chorus , high low scatting squeaking , singing , telling stories , calling herself out she shape shifts into something new	1

i'm not big fan christmas records general but i quickly become addicted aimee mann " one more drifter snow " . album title taken lyrics " calling mary " , new song written aimee her musical chief staff , paul bryan . hold there , buddy . aimee mann writing singing virgin mary , mother jesus christ ? yes , she . " calling mary " terrific song too , dark but not somber , optimistic but not sappy . it rocks , shuffling kind way . it doesn't force its point either . " calling mary voluntary , " according loping chorus . " whatever happened christmas " new aimee mann original it taps deep french roast vein melancholy . this one you'll listen christmas eve while you microwave turkey tv dinner one . ( hey , invite somebody over . yourself favor ! ) . " christmastime " brand new arrangement song written several years ago michael penn ( sean brother , aimee husband ) movie " hard eight " . if you've spent any time malls or elevators during holidays , you've probably heard " christmastime " heavy rotation radio hohoho . reading here " one more drifter snow " bit more organic , little less beatles , little more dylan . aimee also released previous versions two other songs appear this collection . original mann arrangement " christmas song " ( " chestnuts roasting open fire ... " ) circulated radio stations fans several years . aimee sounded like one kids waiting up santa . this new recording , aimee sounds wiser maybe bit sadder . first recording " yourself merry little christmas " originally fan club-only release couple years back . it fine but it lacked power focus version that included " one more drifter snow " . when bells ring aimee sings " we all together , if fates allow , " you'll cry those who gone those who still us . rather than address other highlights set , let me instead close note band , sound aimee . band just terrific " one more drifter snow " . producer paul bryan combines subtle distinctive sound master picker duke levine rich varied textures keyboard ace patrick warren glistening sonic landscape . aimee never sounded better . like many my favorite aimee recordings , " one more drifer snow " took couple listens move me . i noted many negative reviews this record , people commented aimee sounded " bored " or " boring " . i guess i'm not really surprised . i've aimee mann fan many years i've noticed while some people " get it " , many more don't . if you liked any other recordings aimee mann , especially classic " forgotten arm " , you probably love this album . if you low threshold naked emotion , maybe you should start something more cheerful , like patti smith christmas record . merry christmas all !	1
my favorite cat release - like most , i got into cat because film harold amp ; maude - several tunes here , including haunting ' trouble ' rest album also wonderful - only filler would ' rock star ' , but even it grows you . sad this album not better represented his popular ' best ' release . this best cat ' tillerman ' album	1
this cd easily among my all time favorite cds . great rock start finish well worth cash . i hear seether new studio album out 2007 , it hard them top this great cd unless shaun puts his amy lee problems into his writing like she lol	1
imagine approaching dylan directly after this album release saying him , `amazing album , bob . perhaps greatest album i've ever heard , but this year end , it won't album year . ' fortunately dylan , it would his own album [ highway 61 revisited ] would top it , it would album would stand greatest album ever released . what makes highway 61 even more impressive fact `positively 4th street ' [ one greatest songs ever recorded ] omitted - most likely because they found it too similar `like rolling stone . ' 1965 , bob dylan greatest year any musician ever . second place isn't even visible . discussing bringing it all back home , it said this dylan first go rock , its importance cannot overstated , all things those lines . album title itself hilarious . also , take good look cover [ notice copy side bob dylan ] . dylan giving big middle finger every person who turned him . so how actual music ? well , let see : `subterranean homesick blues ' said first song its kind . this isn't exactly true . chuck berry `too much monkey business ' semi-rapping thing going , it predates this . said , this song much more aggressive , writing stellar . if i'm not mistaken , `she belongs me ' john cale favorite song . . . period . writing formatted blues , but music , well , isn't . one dylan more subtly-odd songs . every person who i've ever introduced dylan hated `maggie farm ' - while anyway , i know why ; song wonderfully abrasive . it grows you . writing brilliant : funny observant . `love minus zero/no limit ' one finest pieces writing all music . it abounds film literary references , but , like eliot writing , one doesn't pick up every reference appreciate greatness writing . it writing layers . `outlaw blues ' straight blues rock . leave it dylan make social statement seemingly straightforward lyrics comprise last verse : i got woman jackson , i ain't gonna say her name . i got woman jackson , i ain't gonna say her name . she brown-skin woman , but i love her just same . it not uncommon people new dylan think him self-important guy who probably doesn't sense humor . my immediate reaction would point out there great deal humor songs like `like rolling stone , ' `desolation row , ' `tangled up blue ' [ some dylan most respected songs ]; my next response would point them songs like `on road again ' `bob dylan 115th dream . ' they pure hilarity . said writing , especially `bob dylan 115th dream ' executed very high level . this verse displays it well : i repeated my friendswere all jail , sighhe gave me his cardhe said , " call me if they die " i shook his hand said goodbyeran out streetwhen bowling ball came down roadand knocked me off my feeta pay phone ringingit just blew my mindwhen i picked it up said hellothis foot came through line there time when closing verse ` mr. tambourine man ' my favorite moment music - closing line particular . there too many spectacular moments music me favorite , but it still one them . it said , ` mr. tambourine man ' first four acoustic songs finish album . `gates eden ' easily weakest four acoustic songs . this , however , due greatness other three songs . last verse something special : dawn my lover comes meand tells me her dreamswith no attempts shovel glimpseinto ditch what each one meansat times i think there no wordsbut these tell what trueand there no truths outside gates eden during his 60 minute interview , dylan discussing how some his earlier songs seemed come him magic . `it alright , ma ( i'm only bleeding )' example he . it easy see why potent lyrics like : while some principles baptizedto strict party platform tiessocial clubs drag disguiseoutsiders they freely criticizetell nothing except who idolizeand then say god bless him . `it all over now , baby blue ' , many ways , precursor `like rolling stone . ' song more sorrowful less involved , but what songs involved `like rolling stone' ? album filled highlights potential closers , this perfect ending . second verse one music best : highway gamblers , better use your sense . take what you gathered coincidence . empty-handed painter your streetsis drawing crazy patterns your sheets . this sky , too , folding under youand it all over now , baby blue . this album near perfect . how dylan topped it . . . i'll never know . needless say , this essential .	1
yes , album title quite appropriate because everything made this band amazing previous releases ( shining example determination ) far beyond gone . god forbid traded all their originality popularity new streamlined sound . gone amazing catchy two-part guitar harmonies incredible breakdowns . gone amazing lyrics used accompany thier music . gone god forbid far i'm concerned . i gave this album two stars effort . band still incredibly talented band , i respect risks involved introducing clean vocals into music used almost none . vocals quite impressive , instrumentalists still rather talented . this album far too streamlined hackneyed this fan . if you want hear really stellar album , check out determination	1

this my first exploration into music joseph arthur . i actually heard " all our hands " npr then later his website , www.josepharthur.com . because i so taken song ( which doesn't make appearance album , it bonus ) i decided go out buy album . while " all our hands " probably most amazing modern politically charged song i've heard , rest album doesn't quite live up its standard . said , i am thoroughly enjoying blending electronic beats more " traditional " instruments . arthur vocals interesting , different than most pop-rock artists . i tend ear which likes unique , more gritty vocalists ( rem , velvet underground , etc ) . songs all well written intriguing , my favorites ohio , can't exist , echo park ( course all our hands his site ) . if you haven't heard arthur yet , go his site , listen songs there , then buy album . i definitely plan checking out some his earlier works	1

few bands able overcome seemingly inevitable " sophomore slump " , music critics call it . , their second album doesn't measure up first whatsoever . this unfortunately case many great bands , partly due fans ' critics ' continual comparison debut album . " room fire " could've very well considered brilliant stand-alone album , if it wasn't their stunning first album , " this it " . " room fire " somewhat failed meet general expectations , it evident band really capable more . strokes chosen very wisely their release memorable radio songs ; ' last nite ' " this it " , ' reptilia ' " room fire " , then ' juicebox ' " first impressions earth " . these songs recall sort complexity style music past generations . they still thoroughly modern sound , julian casablancas ' clever , articulate vocals , backed guitar rhythms , melodious bass , continuous drumming . each their albums almost seem if they're each one whole song broken up into different phases . it good album , would even better itself if there wasn't shadow " this it " looming over it . still , " room fire " appears lost some freshness pep present their first album . songs released radio singles , ' reptilia ' , ' 12:51 ' , ' end no end ' , all catchy enough lure album sales . rest " room fire " , however , contains many songs rather similar one . strokes figured out pretty good formula coming up plausible melody , but how many times formula repeated before fans get bored ? when you hear one their songs , it unmistakably strokes , it good thing they come up their own style . however , this album well their 3rd album " first impressions earth " , suffers too much same . they still one better bands around 00s , though they yet show their full potential	1
don't get me wrong , i am massive white stripes fan . this album , however , not band justice . it lacks absolute passion i come see jack white playing . i saw them coney island this fall i almost passed out . show much better than even show blackpool dvd , which excellent . there numerous songs very good this album , but they dwarfed but all other albums . although , songs this album amazing when performed live . check out live versions death letter truth doesn't make noise dvd	1
this album really so overated i really can't see reason why . probably because it released year after london calling ( 1979 ) which one greatest albums all time . so presumably critics expecting something would match london calling . true this mess throughout , but " beautiful mess " . one best albums 80 definitely . invest	1
while i love this album , i must agree quot ; music fanquot ; regarding mix . first i assured myself albums back 1968 sound thin sometimes , but then i read quot ; music fan reviewquot ; realized my first impression correct . it too bad this mix what it , especially regarding bass drums . still , i urge everyone who likes quot ; americanquot ; music purchase it	1

first things first ; midnight marauders impeccable masterpiece contributed growing brilliance one best years hiphop ( 1993 ) . now , over years it become evident me tribe called quest work constantly compared ! why ?. it always debated whether " low end theory " better than " people instinctive travels paths rhythm " or indeed " midnight marauders " , but this ignorant question not possible answer since each tribe album offers something different each time , ensuring each fan their personal favourite . so get off ish !. now personally , midnight marauders i believe atcq most diverse satisfying album they ever put out , purely down fact each track offers its own unique sound ensures any hiphop fan find their " favourite track " constantly changing . incase you not familiar atcq music , it mainly made up east coast , jazzy/conscious , laid back vibe not really ideal fans gangsta rap hard-hitting drum patterns occupied majority 1993-1994 . q-tip posesses one most laid back voices hiphop , so if you're looking rugged/dark album , sorry you not find it here . similarly , you not find one weak track this album , every track listened somewhere , sometime resulting amazingly consistent album played track 1-15 leaving you wanting hit rewind button .

i bought this when it originally came out back mid 80s ... it cassette ... i wore it out , since it costed so much , i college student .. i didn't rebuy it ... i just recently purchased it ... this cd still all its magic . omar hakim drums branford marsalis horns ... it totally jazz rock fusion gem . there some jazz folks out there totally thumb their nose sting , but they snobs , they should ignored ... i love all songs but my favorite one world/love second wave combo beginning side two . this really treat , it could went 10 minutes far i am concerned . songs tight , band great music swings . there nothing dislike this cd there no weak songs . all two cd set . if you like dream blue turtles would like know what would sounded like live , then get this cd . it very impressive . fun	1
without doubt , gentlemen masterpiece raw emotional outpouring ... feelings confusion , indifference , infidelity , heartbreak , ... oh yes , love all staged against ragged musical backdrop both gripping fiercely compelling . album works so many levels but i feel gentlemen works best when listened one sitting . preferably bottle whiskey nearby . this not kind emotional record you cry ... but one you may feel anger , disgust , guilt .	1
this most listenable cd i heard all year . chris ziter sasha bell trade off vocals excellent effect even guita maestra jeff baron gets into act " rabbit . " this quintessential road trip album travel leave-taking major theme . i driving around top down listening " don't know why " all summer .	1
mind bending super album their career . soundgarden amazing talent come together perfectly this album . heavy , majestic , rolling , pounding rhythms melodies throughout . incredible vocals -- searing guitar -- drums edge . - bass pounding my soul - tempo time changes everywhere . wow this album completely destroys competition their midst . i must listened this album 100 times when it released this day it takes me somewhere else . this album perfect . i saw them tour superunknown disappointed they didn't play any songs badmotorfinger . what ?? how happen ? maybe my memory hazy they might played outshined - but seriously what f** !?	1
fan both david lynch trent reznor , this meeting two worlds no-brainer me . imagine if you putting three soundtracks " cool world " , " twin peaks " " crow " shuffle . that roughly what this sounds like , kind . or maybe it easier just imagine quality songs nin , bowie , smashing pumpkins , lou reed , marilyn manson , rammstein , some spooky/smokey instrumentals . while this might not great what trent " natural born killers " soundtrack , or smooth what badalamenti past , it still something get " lost " .	1

everybody knows heard " times they a-changin , " one bob dylan biggest hits . everybody knows he protest period this record came out smack middle it . but what they may not know there songs love loss this album tear your heart out . bob dylan then now master words . probably greatest wordsmith his generation , mine too . then there song impossible define " hour ship comes . " it just simply good words , powerful , i say . very powerful . but my favorite song here " one too many mornings . " it gets tear or two me every time i hear it	1
i've read other reviews but none them caused me buy cd . i own other kw cds . i like his stuff . truthful , i can't pick his sound but i know some his good tunes . there other sax players i listen more frequently but i always enjoy kw when i put his stuff player . this project similar . it nice listen throughout entire project . number tracks more my taste then others but i'm not disappointed i bought it . i certainly wasted my money other cds . all , this money well spent " smooth jazz " sax sound . above all , i like hearing original material this full !!	1
pink floyd now mythical band , released " dark side moon " early 70 today considered land mark one teh greeatest records all time . " wish you here " album came afterwards 1979 also magnificiant double album " wall " . although it hard compare them , i think these 3 albums all 5 stars masterpieces their own without making further analyzations . " wish you here " concept album dedicated pink floyd fouding member syd barrett left band cause mental ilness just after album " saucerful secrets " releasd ( although he appeared sessions ) sadly left us good june 2006 . it jazzy prog/rock influenced album great melodies 5 songs where 2 last over 10 minutes . david gilmour guitar play fantastic all through album when he get chance jam long periods roger water craftmanship compositions always fundamental great floyd album , even richard wright co-wrote some songs , it would take 20 years until he would again . it starts " shine you crazy diamond part 1 " which so long it cut 2 parts , originally it 9 parts but not newer records . first opener second closer , originally there song called " shine " used concerts , but it changed current title made much longer aswell . actually part starts long jazzy gilmour solo which one his best , only end waters joins sings some lyrics ( related syd ) there great saxophone solo dick perry . song title also echoes syd barrett name shine , you diamond . you say there several parts 2 " shine " songs ( 9 correct ) which all diffrent each other . song number two called " welcome machine " classic pink floyd song wonderful special effects , synthesizers guitars . song talks their bad experiences music industry , hence they even changed label " wish you here " . third song " cigar " more straight rock then other songs it " just " 5 minutes long , it feautures piano , synthesizers this time very funky blistering guitar solo david gilmour . it also suppost deal their experiences music industry . " wish you here " also got little less special effects magical sounds , basically it song where lyrics focus , gilmour plays accoutic guitar waters sings always , " wish you here " got one their best hooks great riffs aswell . it deals loss syd barrett waters inner feelings alienation depression stardome . perhaps this band most deepest song them all , says alot . second part " shine " closes album , it uses far more special effects synthesizers , but once again fantastic solo gilmour . perfect closer one most magical albums all time . overall , one greatest pink floyd albums . only 5 songs appear it , but they all excellent their own cause they all significant meaning they express so many diffrent kinds feelings , musically this takes you world it long , often somber recordings influents jazz prog . rock . concept album dedicated syd barrett 1946-2006 . rest peace	1
rhonda spectacular cd . new traditional bluegrass some mighty fine balads golspel . duets her brother , dolly parton bobby osborne spotlight some great harmonies . sound clean crisp . 60 years since mr. monroe invented bluegrass , it always tied gospel music . if you don't want hear little gospel , why world would you buy bluegrass cd .	1
jewel debut album , pieces you put this gorgeous singer-songwriter map . what beautiful album this . well ok , you meant me awful here , buy cd single version instead , but rest tracks great . morning song , pieces you , near you always , angel standing , foolish games , i'm sensitive my fave tracks . i love her song-writing , so poetic graceful . she true talent . i can't wait til her new cd comes out , goodbye alice wonderland . i used hear this album everyday when i came home school , i bought this album when i 8th grade , hard believe all time passed i am still huge fan jewel . love her poetry well although critics hated it . there few live tracks this record , she her best live . jewel rare artist , she used live her van before she discovered . pieces you simple timeless	1
i really enjoy listening music all orleans cd . especially ones 70 early 80 when wells kelly drummer . it music very easy listening fun . anyone who thinks otherwise doesn't know their music	1
... i still go back it , other coldplay cds , which i've bought , i think , all now . i tend fall love specific songs more than specific bands , but not this case . i find more i listen ( this cd particular ) , then go back other cds , then return , more impressed i am their child-prodigy-like brilliance . coldplay music sweet yet profound ... out its time way . inspire just too tame word what it .	1
combination these two great artists continually results some finest music making ever . two seem almost share mind while performing so perfectly tune each other they come across . i don't think brahms ever sounded so beautiful alive this recording manages sound	1
who fourth studio(and fifth overall ) album tommy released may 1969 . tommy album who make or break group because if tommy failed , who would probably disbanded due lack funds despite their concerts selling out based pete townshend guitar smashing keith moon drum kit demolishing end each gig . guitarist pete townshend , under gun after i see miles failed single uk(although it their biggest ever hit here us ) came up rock opera deaf , dumb blind kid named tommy whom becomes those aforementioned things after witnessing event child traumatized him(his father killing his step-father whom he considered his father ) . originally considered studio album , band felt it didn't make sense so they expanded it into double album result one rock top 10 greatest double studio albums history(alongside other classic double albums like then-already released jimi hendrix electric ladyland beatles ' white album would help pave way more classics like rolling stones ' 1972 masterwork exile main street , who 1973 release quadrophenia , elton john 1973 classic goodbye yellow brick road , genesis ' 1974 masterwork lamb lies down broadway , led zeppelin 1975 classic physical graffiti , pink floyd 1979 masterpiece wall bruce springsteen 1980 classic river among many others ) . alot classics appear this album like overture , classic top 20 hit pinball wizard , amazing journey , underture(best instrumental here which basically repeat album other instrumental sparks but longer ) , go mirror , i'm free , cousin kevin(one bass player john entwistle greatest compositions ) , fiddle about(about perverted uncle ernie also penned ox ) , tommy holiday camp(another excellent ditty written drummer keith moon whom excellent rendition film version tommy 1975 ) classic finale we're not gonna take it/see me feel me . other tracks album it boy , 1921(you didn't hear it ) , eyesight blind , christmas , acid queen , you think it alright , there doctor i've found , tommy you hear me ?, smash mirror , sensation , miracle cure , sally simpson welcome all great pieces well although tend overlooked . album made who legends good peaked #4 billboard chart their first gold seller(eventually platinum ) . 1996 , album re-released remastered cd new re-mix jon astley(the who longtime producer ) came second generation masters . october 2003(just time tommy 35th anniversary ) , geffen records(formerly known mca ) would then re-release album again this time 2-disc hybrid sacd original 1969 mix cd layer killer 5.1 mix sacd layer this version uses very original tapes found universal vault after said booklet original tapes destroyed kit lambert fire . highly recommended	1

first time this year i managed get tickets see satriani perform hammersmith apollo london , majority material he played new album . i safely say i believe it his strongest outing since crystal planet . after some very mediocre albums , satriani once more struck back superb balance speed passion ; some lovely melodic hooks ' ten words ' ' love eternal ' , not mention some excellent rocky songs such superbly executed ' bedshift racers ' indeed title track . perhaps only thing stops me giving this album full five stars way which songs don't progress until almost quarter or halfway through song ; beginnings often slightly mediocre , which satriani slightly unusual . however , it must said this step right direction one technically greatest guitar players world . superb alloy melody speed ; step away ' engines creation ' step towards ' crystal planet	1
poor ms. furtado can't seem come close her " whoa , nelly " cd . i found this cd mostly boring , not recommend it	1
let get one thing straight : today 09/15/03 , there no quot ; ultimatequot ; john lee hooker collection . but 31 his best tracks , this rhino mini-box comes closest hooker nirvana . ( there 10-cd set , epitath , but since it would take week listen it once , i'll pass . ) problem compiling such collection implied boogie man , charles shaar murray fine biography . hooker recorded number different labels , especially his early days , also under variety different names ( john lee booker , john lee cooker , little pork chop , etc . ) , so it takes lot legwork figure out just which recordings made hooker all , much less obtain rights rerelease them . ( murray spends almost half book such detective work . ) therefore , such classic gems quot ; floodquot ; quot ; whiskey wimmenquot ; not included this set . still , it very good attempt . rhino chosen start collection track quot ; teachin ' blues , quot ; which aural primer how he created his unique sound . thus educated , listener then move such primal tunes quot ; boogie chillunquot ; ( live staple virtually every major blues band canned heat savoy brown , this number hooker chose perform guest spot rolling stones steel wheels tour eighties . ) , quot ; crawling king snakequot ; ( covered wonderfully doors ) , quot ; boom , boomquot ; ( animals ) , his reinterpretation amos milburn song , here entitled quot ; one bourbon , one scotch , one beer ( which , when combined john l house rent boogie , very well covered george thorogood ) . he recorded several such reinterpretations , most notably quot ; frisco bluesquot ; ( this case , he reportedly didn't try get correct lyrics tony bennett famed quot ; i left my heart san francisco ; quot ; he just sat down recorded his own off-the-cuff rendition . ) . conclusion , there plenty john lee hooker best stuff here warrant recommendation ; it just not quot ; ultimatequot ; his most devoted fans would want it	1

i love mike bloomfield , thrilled hear this recording immediately ordered it . what great dissappointment ! drummer so incredibly bad it hard believe he not dragged off stage mid song . fabulous numbers like " don't throw your love me so strong " completely ruined . he no clue slow blues groove , seems completely lost actually goes into waltz cut time !! i am not exaggerating . worst recorded case incompetence i ever heard . bass player gives up after while just follows . it amazing bloomfield even capable playing such sabotage , testament his great musicianship . very unfortunate what would great addition bloomfield recorded work . hard listen . i recommend you check out fabulous " my labors more " nick gravenites some best recorded examples bloomfield live still available	1

it this album mckennitt awesome talent composer/arranger truly finds distinctive voice -- somewhere celtic , jazz , folk world music -- so prominent beloved her later work . most music some lyrics well " parallel dreams " written mckennitt their entirety rather than arrangements traditional tunes or poems . there still sense quiet restraint many songs this album , but this time it underlain pregnant intensity synth chords percussion , released into music just enough give it air mysterious purpose without overwhelming mckennitt ethereal vocals nuanced harpistry . guest musicians include rick lazar udu drum congas , ratesh dasj tablas , guitarist brian hughes , violinist oliver schroer , cellist , bass tamboura player george koller , mandolin-player david woodhead , piper patrick hutchinson , percussionist al cross , shelly berger pzud . loreena mckennitt previous album " drive cold winter away , " next one sequence , continuing her intriguing development composer , " visit . " i love everything she ever -- she true talent creative genius you could ever wish musician . but what impresses me most her how stirringly satisfyingly her work evolved over years . she just keeps getting better better ! try also celtic / folk / world music stylings singer multi-instrumentalist kate price work dreamy vocalist / pianist lydia mccauley .	1

long last here dierks long awaited second album ... after hits like " what i thinkin '" or " train travelling " our expectations high . if first cd presented some items little too calm , here start " lot leavin ' left " we're swing things . it moves it good . dierks true identity his voice . he among artists you spot five seconds . altogether album more rhythm even if we some gorgeous ballads like " good things happen " not underrated . banjo , invariably , give mood ( " easy street " ) , honky tonk , rock `n roll ( " so so long " ) . superb album ranking bentley country music top singers . melodies all beautiful , one after other . cherry top , new duet del mc coury ( " good man like me " ) ; dierks stands out happy man ; he sounds if he laughing when he sings . he puts you good mood . great music , top notch solos ( " lot leavin ' left " ) this some album ! real good ! facm ( french association country music - http://facm.free.fr )	1
first all , i'd liked start off saying this cd review should more than 3 1/2 stars . what hell wrong you people , people bugging if you think " survivor " better than this . album bunch fillers just plain " pointless " . these tracks more mature , better when performed live . i saw them when they new york last august touring , i especially inpressed michelle . she killed " through love " , well her solo single " you know " . honest i wish they never broke up , because there lack true rb groups out there . they need get reunion together give these other groups run their money .	1
what incredible career . chris whitley very special man musical icon went largely unnoticed his lifetime -which all too short . i've listening chris ' music since 1991 seen his intense live performances everytime he came los angeles area . without getting overly sappy this , ' reiter ' one cw greatest records . if only flaming lips cover , " mountain side " . it one my favorite cw songs ( more chris ' song now , than flaming lips , which he huge fan ) . it real treat what ended up his last album , he came full-circle way , back electric sounds 1995 ' din ecstacy ' , while still adding contemporary touch his unique ever-evolving style music . it getting harder me write this review , album currently playing background i want commence grooving ! it too bad amazon doesn't make song samples available , because visceral quality music immediate . highlights : " mountain side " , " reiter " , " i go evil " , " inn " , " all beauty taken you this life remains forever " . if you love chris , go buy two copies this album asap . even if you've never heard note his music , go buy two copies anyway . your life changed forever	1
this one my favorite soundtracks ! first half cd much better than second half , but that because first several songs all actually sung movie . i love " please , mr. jailer " ... it really sexy song , fun listen . this soundtrack filled great 50s songs . it tons fun . only thing i'm little disappointed two songs soundtrack differ movie versions . " doin time bein young " completely different version ... they took out background singers ( other jailbirds accompanied cry baby movie ... you know-they're ones who shout , " stinkin tank ! stinkin tank ! " ) , james intveld ( singing voice cry baby ) singing also different this song . movie , voice yelling more than singing , but not cd . i liked it movie better , since it seemed more realistic johnny depp actually singing , but it still good . also , " mr. sandman " different . it hard describe what differences , but they definitely there . parts , i think it sung octave higher , but who knows . aside these differences , this soundtrack awesome . if movie made you jump out your seat dance , then you gotta get this cd .	1
i've this cd since it first came out it blessed me so much . it definitely people who true worshippers because it highly annointed . i love whole cd but my favorites tracks #4 - #9 we use these tracks our communion services . i also used these tracks our women retreat everyone blessed	1
i'm not raving mathis fan although i like his music . stopping off cd outlet allows you preview cds before you buy them , i put headphones just out curiosity see how mathis sang warren songs . wow , i pleasantly suprised . after hearing don't take away my heaven ( my favorite song cd ) time this night over , i hooked . this cd become one my favorites ! those who say mathis doesn't sing it well ( fill blank ); perhaps this because it not way you first heard song . highly recommend mathis fans nonfans alike	1
yeah i like missy , but i'm not sure this her absolute best . i like it , but i like her latest album better . me , while all songs really good , two best work it you hear me ?. you hear me such beautiful , heartfelt sad songs around . i love it play one so often . it such nice tribute lot great singers who died too early . it beautiful . anyway , this cd very good , but not her best	1

this cd amazing ! first time i heard it record store , i havn't stopped listening it ... such refreshing change top 10 mainstream . it all latin flavor without overbearing . anyone appreciate this cd especially those who like move ! some songs bit slow but even those make great mood music . even though its short album - i promise you won't ever skip song	1
if you don't like punk , not green day junk , true anti-social punk music kicks you face , don't get this album . if you like music grates you , pisses you off , generally anti-social get this album . it reincarnation all fing great punk , grating vocals thrash . not wanna crowd	1

really puzzled so many bad reviews this great batch ofsongs . my expectations so low , these songs soincredibly likeable . " bad sound " really just verynice , very informal , very fresh recording . i'm not even fanof beth orton , i think this just one mostwonderful rewarding efforts i've heard years	1
disraeli gears cream breakthrough achievement . their most famous piece work , their highest praised too . , it deserves all this . album fully entertaining . some spots may lower than usual standard , but it doesn't really get boring . length okay , some say it too short , but i like my albums this long . songs then . album kicks off strange brew . though it isn't much opener ( i'd put swlabr instead ) , it still nice song some nice clapton blues licks . after , bruce kicks agressive bass line , eric follows guitar riff everybody knows : sunshine your love . standout thing this song baker drums , course , you can't forget clapton solo . last two songs singles , so album really starts after sunshine your love . world pain got some mixed up melodies , may require few listens get used . i like song . dance night away one my favourite songs album . eric ginger really make this one . clapton rhythm guitar tone excellent here , leads sound pretty psychedelic . i really like drums during chorus . blue condition isn't very good track . it drags , lyrics sound strange it repetitive , plus it isn't fun last two . i like some parts it though . tales brave ulysses sounds lot like white room , song band would release later . white room much better . it album instead , put opener , this could my favourite album ever . anyway , song isn't bad . not much say it , though i'm not fond lyrics . swlabr damn fine track , most fun album . hooks get your head you'll singing them no time . great solo there . we're going wrong excellent . atmosphere set up ginger drums , then eric joins soft guitar then some nice licks . i like jack vocals this . i don't know what happened near end , when eric ginger go crazy play something completely out context , but then jack closes song nicely . outside woman blues i'm not much fond . blues lick repeated too many times , it isn't song i particularly like . take it back got fun start , i like john vocal start , but then it loses its magic . group finishes album mother lament , joke song , doesn't spoil album any way . i like how they sing boy-by . anyway , damn fine album , very enjoyable some nice songs . i highly recommend it .	1
both first fifth symphonies considered gems bernstein later mahler cycle dg . previously , they available separately full price each . but now , thankfully , they released together , songs wayfarer featuring thomas hampson , 2 1 price . shame amazon not recommending this one instead 2 cds separately . i guess it more profits than recommendations	1
i not know this group before . their songs much easy listen , optimal musical experience	1
vocalist lead track well aria several other tracks throughout this album , i am dissapointed i not get recognition i promised jenkins . however , i think album beautiful i am pleased i involved	1
explosions sky debut album , originally only released extremely small numbers cd-r , remastered rerelesed , much anticipation fans . ignore band self-doubt written cd itself -- this solid , amazing album . less buildup/ " explosions " , eits crafted truly all-encompassing grandeur , while this album feels less produced than their later efforts , it defintiely matches up more recent work . my only complaint less impressive sound quality . standout tracks song our fathers , glittering blackness , especially magic hours	1
once again , kindred family soul more than satisfied neo-soul music lover . entire cd truly remarkable , i love " grown folks " feel it . i unsure if they could top first one , but " this life together " right . no song this album skip over	1
i like ludacris . don't get me wrong . but this album kinda annoying . blow it out yer ass song hard listen repetitive . splash waterfalls song also really redudant , if you heard it radio many times i , you might agree . he just talks through too much this album ... instead rapping .. beats kinda weak repetitive .. there 3 good songs this one : diamonds back , we got , eyebrows down . rest them kinda annoying . but like i said i like luda .. just get red light district or word mouf instead	1
its great lay down listin this cd night just listin ramblings old man . dead radio city hard put into certain category because it touches them all . burroughs goes disturbing revelations dark comedies simple life findings . music backing his voice this album pretty good even though it sometimes eclipses his voice times . burroughs great monotonic voice this album which creates great atmosphere really drills home his jaded , disgruntled , sarcastic message . all all every song here not winner but most album pure nirvana	1
good beat + punk riffs + catchy , irreverent lyrics = best punk album yearsthere likely lots disagreement what kind music art brut plays . it punk , post-punk , indie ? classify it how you want . bottom line me this great album , likes which i haven't heard since ramones or sex pistols . this what music supposed : fun . if you want world-changing political message your music , listen u2 . if you want fun album harkens back punk anthem classics like " beat brat , " you must buy this album .	1
this cd absolutely , 100% lives up it hype . not only it collection great , dynamic , energetic songs but , it also pivotal it release . just " never mind bollock , here sex pistols " 1970 , " nevermind " 1990 . this changed landscape music . " nevermind " essential listening history rock roll . cobain killing himself even made work much more monumental	1

i don't any their albums , but i remember lot their music . i autographed 45 queen-bee(bo mom)label season whitch . i saw them every teen night they western bowl ( cincinnati , oh ) , there hometown late 60 early 70 . we followed those guys all over tristate . my early days groupie ! happier care free time	1
probably her best dance-able track ever . however , james fernandis " jjmf " doesn't know what he talking . he giving you vinyl track listing . there goes eight bucks . amazon track listing accurate except they removed word " edit " because this idiot . severely sucks because original " groove " best mix madonna track i've ever heard , even better than three-way ones someone mixed few years ago . tracy turns this track gold , but it doesn't appear available long-form outside double 12 " vinyl . i think abba sample ( flutey thing ) lame both album price mixes . other mixes also inferior , but least they very hard-hitting beats distinguish themselves tracy , which needs surround matrixing , boosting subs , some reduction mids mains during club playback . i think it certainly worth trouble if you find version , though . it full digital recording , so i don't like idea spinning it vinyl when it ought available cd . copy sirius played pristine edited cd single version	1

joe jackson so underrated it crime . only artist i compare him aspect " dan reed network " -- go look them up mesmerized . but " you can't get what you want " just so defines 1980 me -- it splendid song . there it , 5th track disc 2 -- just click link play it windows midea player or realplayer -- isn't just great song ? check out " steppin ' out " well -- if you -- find video " steppin ' out " -- damn new york city such spell viewer early 80 .	1
i must admit i never really payed any attention towards while he alive but when his unfortunate death occurred , it made me curious check him out considering how critically acclaimed his only album . i bought it i discovered very talented mc . summer 2000 , much anticipation built this posthumous release good reason . diehard big fan , they may heard some material appears here . " ebonics " circulated single streets " enemy " appeared d.i.t.c. album . but not everything new . those not very familiar , this obviously sound fresh you ; but plenty verses previously appeared freestyles but now it provided new backdrop attempt make it sound better . they succeed . primo produces top-notch material three tracks touched , particularly " platinum plus " which kane destroys . pete rock ron browz wonders " holdin ' it down " " size em up . " injected casual listener "' 98 freestyle , " which often lauded greatest freestyle all-time . also shows diversity impeccable storytelling skills displayed " heist " " casualties dice game " ( despite its weak beat ) . what i like this better than other posthumous albums hip-hop this actually sounds like style production he would rock over . it great album it only supports claim he " king punchline . " ' ask beavis / i get nuthin ' butt-head ' become legendary . he amazing lyrically . he raps way he talks raps swagger jay-z would later inherit . he dearly missed it unfortunate he only alive one album master .	1
we accidentally left this cd car we sold . we held out quite while our empty case , but whenever we'd hear one songs we'd tell ourselves , " we replace cd ! " so we finally . we not typical buyers ; we don't buy music/videos indiscreminantly , not huge music library . but this one , us , " must " ..	1
i such high hopes this one ! however , after dozen tries , i cannot stand this music . it uninteresting possibly contains worst songwriting lyrics i heard years . or maybe it schmultzy music so unbelievably weak . whatever it , it no magic , no risk , no intelligence .	-1
ok , so i know that gonna raise some hackles . but , i can't think last time adult i this much music stick my head . back when i first heard ewf it time i almost nothing but listen music . now i barely time . but i make time this cd . melodic contemporary without selling out their roots . how many bands this . i am so grateful they came back edge midtempo middle age pulled out some real funk . why everyone assume just because you over 40 you wanna hear midtempo ballads only ? other choice uptempo garbage no melodies so many vocal runs you wanna prescribe something make it stop . these guys voices still great- so nice hear maurice ( even though he doesn't tour ) phillip their thing . i wish someone would get stevie , prince handful other great rb performers work artists who respect their music but bring back some edge they sorely missing . this collection music certainly shows how well work . ok- maybe kenny . thing coulda left off - but it last track , you skip it ... i don't mind it much i thought i would	1
i like caravan , i like stuff like camel too . but , they don't leave you too impressed , not even bothered , it doesn't engrave itself within . caravan makes nice little pittoresque undisturbing prog pieces . that it . they neat , cute , good , smart , musically interesting - but not too daring or substantial . not essential . i recall 70s when neighbour girl came home after her flute lessons played small pieces together her brother piano then their mum used drum bongos tambourine . it nice , really , but musical experience it just makes you long real thing . yngwie malmstrom not heavy metal artist , he just guy who loves play guitar , especially scales . caravan land grey pink needed , i don't deny , get album your collection . but caravan generally speaking you might just proceed hatfield north once even though i would go step further egg like . it ok , i don't expect you agree .	1

happily freed jonathan cain drippy grip , neal schon reaches his full potential this double-album . i think , among other things , percussion , sheer energy evident this album help push it far beyond what accomplished beyond thunder ( beautiful though album ) . this probably my all-time favorite cd category guitar-players-gone-solo . muy excelente	1
people blew this cd way out proportion how good it . yeah it sold 9 million held #1 top 40 charts good minute , but c'mon people . he remade song when girls preschool playing jump rope . i think he decent job , when trying please certain crowd ( mainly crowd who listens lot alternative music very little rap ) . now rest cd really didn't appeal me except batter up e.i. ( before they became hit singles ) some it pointless singing weak catchy rhymres attempt get your ears tuned , get airplay radio ( good example this track loven me ) . i sit here type how bad nelly rapper , but would very pointless . so however many people not this album , you get it add sales or you real it just not buy it never think it again	-1

bangles - greatest hits . what i say ? i really enjoyed this album . not only it contain my favourite tracks " walk like egyptian " " hazy shade winter " but there other tracks , honest , i hadn't heard before but found them catchy all same . i rate this album alongside belinda carlisle greatest hits - which i reckon great " road trip " album . i unashamedly admit liking lot 80s music - whether lyrics make any sense or not , isn't all end all - so bangles get my vote .	1
my fancy apple pie la mode gives me happy face shiny brown eyes . knowing i am independent woman . i know i find sexy daddy who bring me emotion make me feel like i'm dangerously love . even though ........ my story beauty sweet , sassy gospel melody . i know i am talented . forever i am not nasty girl , i am forever bootylicious i my mother thank . so i want say thank you . but my goal life become suvivor like destiny child when they recorded this album .	1
this far one worse things i've ever heard . right up there chingy or changy or whatever it . they should ashamed . it miracle say " laffy taffy " still show their faces public . shame shame . record , d4l , para-quote your own lyrics , no " i can't it it like you " nor would i want . i would never suck so bad . 1 star here it comes	-1
back day , there group perfomed groups brought whole house down . blue magic member latter . this collection filled classic gems nobody able replace ( sideshow , three ring circus ) , introduced me tunes i never heard before , but just beautiful tunes everyone remembers ( land make-believe , teach me ) . even there dance tunes bounce give you reason jig it up ( look me up , magic #) . anyone who into real music must this disc , because it not always who you heard radio or who performed concert , but how they affected you while listening . these guys definitely part legacy never denied	1
bought this album i like texas singers/songwriters this recommended me . first time i heard album , i thought it okay , but after subsequent listenings , songs grown me i find myself playing it more more . like one other reviewers said , its great album while you doing things , like grilling out , working car , etc . nice bluesy , laidback record . smoooooth guitar playing	1

this review contains nothing new what you already read other customers who heard , own this particular album . this straight up country music album , what country album should . i bought this album mainly because i blown away song " your man " . although songs here strong , besides smash hit " your man " , highlights this record : lord mercy country boy , way down south , gravity . why i didn't give this album full 5 star there some songs i didn't particularly enjoy : " no rush " drag , too slow my liking therefore i think it entitled appropriately " white noise " okay song , i just never fan jon anderson . overall , josh second release worth listen . enjoy	1
sundays come out cd once decade , thus putting me constant cravings new material . though camera obscura very original very much their own band , they satisfy cravings only harriet wheeler could touch . truly vast intimate same time , voice speaks something very deep , sad lovely inside you	1

213 always revered west coast super-group public never got hear . but demo tapes leaked basement sessions always tease fans braidless snoop dogg , dj warren , pre-fedora nate dogg . last five years , each aforementioned promised this album list different labels , different title different themes . what it boiled down snoop , nate warren finding themselves some spare time their hands . hard way portrays crew artists search creative vigor they dozen plus years ago original 213 . warren trademarked himself laid back mc . hits like " this dj " , more recent , " i want it all " , he never expected raise his voice , or stray his effortless flow . snoop , other hand , one time edgy mc range emotion . his sharp venomous verses tracks like , " pump pump " " shiznit , " snoop deft sticking words up under your ribcage . older tracks reference points because those days 213 hail . it not overly laid back snoop , slightly less laid back warren , impromptu nate . exactly what we're getting . too smooth , thus energy-lacking effort , sounds more like gap band album than any hip-hop triad . most blatant rap tracks like , " 213 tha gangsta clicc " " mlk " dominated aggressive synthesized beats . softer side things shine through because better half this album comes smooth tracks like , " summer " , " run up " , " lil ' girl . " warren g cadences throughout album taking all-too close resemblance his half-brother , dr. dre style delivery . " mlk " " absolutely " major proof . lyrical side things , nate steals show . " mary jane " " so fly " two album more exciting cuts reveal nate fabulous quality . he doesn't stay boxed-in hooks , but rather nate dogg dances around most verses this album one-of-a-kind baritone croon . luckily , dave chapelle rick james persona only guest , lasting interlude . but , wake rick death , humor lost . while 213 didn't water-down their album outsiders , much desired considering years hype . one most disturbing facts 213 album it no producer . warren refused produce anything since lackluster sales his last album . result , this album uses music supplied producers who no cognition what original 213 , or should sound like . only reputable producer fits mold dj pooh , who responsible " groupie luv . " while nottz , hi-tek , kanye west wonderful producers , this wasn't their place . one effort seem match early vibe , " joysticc . " this track uses " juicy fruit " percussion , thick synth tones new wave chorus . track nate dominates " so fly . " this outstanding soul chop ( vinyl hiss ) provided none other than missy eliot . we even forget smilez southstar tried this same beat before . otherwise , this album barely separates itself eastsidaz album . perhaps hardest reality this album jaded element . it hard watch your heroes get so cocky they forget why they're originally it . it widely hoped this album would return way things . instead , we three aging stars total ignorance their history together , using their fame wealth large subject matter , over foreign production . after dozen years believing 213 west super group , this album only affirms fact it truly westside connection who wears crown . 2.5 outta ' 5	1
i listened this cd few times love parts it . but first i address something ... regarding " fallen rock zone " lyrics , why would these dissuade anyone listening cd ? song not favor pedophiles any way . you just scared because they say masterbater ? seriously . i love first half this cd because it pumped up fast paced . second half more downer . singer very good his voice , its more high pitched ( he like alto ) , like mars volta . difference here i stand ra , but not tmv . i became interested this band when i heard " rectifier " chronix radio ( internet via shoutcast ) . flaws , i think they just repeat too many lines . come up some more lyrics ! yes , i like rectifier , but he says " rectifier " like 20 times during it . this makes songs less shelf life because you get tired them . anyway , i really like this cd because it seems something you listen anyone . i'd rather pull this out than flames , opeth , or trivium when i'm someone i don't know too well . much more accessible music . enjoy	1
i love john hiatt . he so under-rated over-looked . he so talented . great writer great musician . bring family , perfectly good guitar , slow turning ... all rock ! check out any his albums ... all great	1
this recording established fan galas ' work , it far more demanding listener than any other her vary varied works , except perhaps schrei . it aims , instance , spots emulate tedium insanity such it seem self-indulgently repetitive , or quiet , or extreme . one might well ask if demands placed listener justified ; one might well answer , quot ; no . quot ; get most out it , however , one must obey command quot ; play only maximum volumequot ;; good headphones hour dedicated nothing but concentration should also strongly recommended . complete opus galas ' work , there no choice but buy quot ; endurequot ; this recording open attentive mind , but really little make it seem , some way , almost academic spite galas ' perfectly self-evident sincerity . rewards certainly there patient ; otherwise , simply buy everything else her	1
who sell out milestone recording , years long standing favorite mine . i own two different vinyl copies which i cherished . my decision buy this cd based friend recommendation fact there " extra songs " . i unprepared just how many additional songs included this release , most them simply jaw-droppingly astounding . my personal favorite bonus track sell out who version " melancholia " , which i heard previously only pete townshend demo he released " scoop " album . notes " scoop " tell perhaps it roger who unhappy melancholia it wasn't quite " macho " enough . also coca-cola track just simply rocks . what amazing band who ! this record epic ! if you unfamiliar this record then i seriously advise stopping your first several listenings rael ( i ) order truly experience album it released intended heard . only after should you dive into all these bonus tracks your reward ! remastering here excellent should played excessively loud volumes over over over again order truly appreciate it . this quite simply inspiring should belong collection every music lover any interest ' 60 music or british pop . sophistication craft , range genres song song , songwriting playing no equal anywhere . even if you think you may not like who ( perhaps you only heard classic rock ' 70 anthems , or maybe you thought tommy pretensious long-winded ) then you owe it yourself hear them their absolute creative peak !	1

heard these guys 2006 taste chicago just before ray davis ; tough headliner usurp . my morning jacket delivered awesome live set lot fans place : i picked up cd they maintained layered , reverb-heavy sound they live album . trippy , immediately impressive original but reminiscent what innovative old school sixites rock bands worked : melodic recognizability . they've certainly picked bones classic artists bits songs , but their mix stuff magical i look forward their next album . well !	1
i am great fan allison moorer , very anxious her produce new cd . my first reaction her pop-like songs this cd disappointment , mainly because i didn't expect them allison but also because that not my favorite style music . nonetheless , after giving album fair chance i find it wonderful recording . first , allison performs these pop , or lets just say " happier " songs , very well . she showing she perform mainstream music right up there very best . i soon found myself enjoying these songs addition rest . still , allison true calling where she stands without peer , her spellbindingly haunting , smooth liquid gold ballads . no one even comes close allison here . well , " getting somewhere " not neglect this aspect allison . my opinion , " new years day " worth entire price this cd . " how she it " wonderful . " hallelujah " " where you " so smooth beautiful you might danger melting . these classic allison moorer highest caliber . then , allison ends her " getting somewhere " track . it pure allison , fantastic song . how any fan hers deny themselves these tracks ? i not comprehend why other reviewers disappointed this album . so allison tried few " lite " songs , big deal . give her break ! she them quite well any case . unlike some reviewers , i think band best she . i've always thought her other bands amateurish , although even lent bit it own charm , made you realize allison so good she didn't need great band . guitar " fuzz tone " poor , but i'm guitar freak . one criticism i cd some muddiness it . if i didn't buy it this reason though , i would bigger looser . allison , thank you very much this recording effort , please don't wait so long make ! maybe someday , when your heart finally touched right place , you could even record christmas album . your voice would awesome singing many classics such " what child this " , " silent night " etc . i'll buy many you sing . good luck ( god care you allison )	1
these guys greatest this best collection available . take advantage it buy it , you won't dissapointed	1
i think asia one great rock bands all time . they easy criticize but what there not like ? great lyrics , great music , great singing .... asia pre-payne still my most enjoyable music off shelf . i continued follow wetton his solo journey . i miss strong cd beginning end hoping icon would it . it not but it start . songs lyrics thoughtful well produced but i also wanted them let go bit some fun . there some tracks here some their best but overall it doesn't stand up their original ' 90s cds asia . this just teaser though . i want cd these two icons rock	1
title says it all . she good i'm fan . this her best release this point subsequent . warm , quiet swing , terrific side men . bit more piano work displayed here several tracks . performance nearly identical also available dvd . recommend both . doesn't get any better .	1
great mix shows band deversity . very enjoyable . i think this audioslave best work so far	1
keane one greatest bands all time . fact they use piano/keyboards/bass/drums every song , no guitars all , shows they more musically sophisticated than all other mindless guitar rock that out there . there more than enough guitar-based bands . " somewhere only we know " best song all time . beautiful lyrics , solid piano backbone , steady , moderate tempo , make it brilliant album-opener . album upbeat pop/rock , like " bend break " " this last time , " slow , sorrowful ballads , like " she no time " " we might well strangers , " gentle , peaceful melodies , like " sunshine , " slightly ethereal , unearthly ones like " untitled 1 " " bedshaped . " plus , all lyrics intensely personal honest , ones everyone relate , one way or . all together , album classic , one ( if american public knows anything music ) live known one greatest albums ever made . every song masterpiece . there no fillers .	1
this 1988 disc revolutionary many ways example what hip-hop might become it not entire generation heavily marketed dervishes parachute pants manipulating stereotypes fast buck guys who used word " bitch " punctuation while shamelessly exploiting their own culture . 18 years later i still recite lyrics every song verbatim i haven't heard any songs over decade . radical , extreme lyrics over mile-wide grooves all unrelenting pace . fans james brown band , jbs and/or maceo parker recognize many samples . excellent , brilliant " radical extreme " . get it	1
one best things blues or blue rock simplicity it . since there specific defined rules 12 bar blues system , we consumers subjected almost every kind imaginable . i myself , never get tired endless blues guitar heroes like srv , johnny winter , eric clapton , bb king , albert king every other professional or local artist emulates their heroes create blues rock . repetitive ? sure thing ! boring ? never ! i understand when critics blues complain all songs sound same , because i make same argument endless pop hip-hop gracing our radio stations 24/7 . so consumer blues rock , i've heard same stuff over over . then there sonny landreth . sonny , everything bit different . his blues not quite traditional ; his rock not quite rock . but whatever it , it needs played loud ! we consumers blues rock should celebrate sonny his band creating something truly unique different . blues guitar player , myself countless other players grab slide play few tunes open or , maybe get crowd going , but none us really care truly commit slide guitar full time . it takes lot get guitar player stray comfort zone standard tuning . sonny all bets off . his style truly indescribable point i would throw my hands air if i ever tried emulate him . this record top bottom true piece work . if i stolen i would definitely buy copy . i only few complaints , which very minor admittedly nit-picking . i think " broken hearted road " misplaced track order . i really wished rockin ' opener " native stepson " immediately followed high octane " gone pecan " just keep energy going . i really like " broken hearted road " , but i find myself skipping it because tempo . but , this live record , so if sonny chose play it order , so it ! second , i love instrumentals , but i wished sonny would added few more tracks he sings . sonny voice doesn't blow anyone away , he knows guitar how he makes his living , he got such amazing selection great tunes he sing , why not throw couple ? i don't ever want associate sonny countless " instrumental guitar " players never sing , because anyone owns any his solo studio records knows he write sing . thirdly , maybe this due editing , sonny rarely speaks crowed during breaks track . like i said , he may several conversations crowd , but it could edited shorten running time , but i always enjoy hearing those kinds things records . lastly , i want more ! more tracks , volume ii , extended cut , dvd i'll take anything this point ! buy this record . every tune least one or two points blow your mind ! i'm like , " what ... how he doing ? " if you ever get chance see sonny live , go it !	1
lang lang who ? he not poetry cortot ; he isn't technically gifted horowitz or barere ; he not structural playing arrau , nor deep sonority rubinstein . what frustrates me most he tries copy horowitz . i symphony hall last year listening him play mozart , chopin , rachmaninoff , schumann liszt , his last piece horowitz arrangement liszt second rhapsody . who hell he think he ? he lacked power , articulation clarity , magic . when horowitz played carmen everybody went home astonished if they run into force nature . i went home full question marks . he plays fast . really fast . yet his rachmaninoff unethical , his chopin sonata stale lackluster , his liszt so embellished it becomes patchy lopsided . i fell asleep when he played kinderszenen . lang lang concerts like circus acts - what happened purity music-making ? it really possible walk stage flashing lights like some rockstar would , then launch into mozart sonata ? if he really turns-out future classical music , i think it would time me hide monastery somewhere eastern europe listen cortot recordings rest my life . day would sad day indeed	1

anyway , zevon starts out one his great puffs smoke : " some days i feel like my shadow smoking me , some days asbestos don't shine . " i love image shadow smoking person -- it evokes lung cancer , state yellowed teeth , death , yet , lyrics carefully crafted : some days zevon , i'm going presume there plenty chain-smoking going this album , feel his shadow smoking him asbestos not shining . even face certain frivolous lawsuits , implication remains there days when asbestos shines -- when warren still casts his own smoke . later smoke , we're reminded warren " smoking down [ his ] asbestos-faking life times , " lump hits cancer . oh , this painful puff . it so painful , so many levels ( smoke-1 special essential viewing ) , warren . but like all nicotine works music , it somehow raises spirit -- both listener singer-songwriter .	1

up this point , my knowledge bonnie prince consisted master everyone , ease down road , i see darkness ( which , my humble opinion , contains greatest love song ever written all around ) . i absolutely no knowledge matt sweeney . given , when i popped superwolf , sound initially caught me off guard . i persisted , course , rewarded fantastically woven tapestry lyricism melody . it chock full sweet , easy melodies , harmonizing vocal overlays , well-placed crescendos characteristic oldham earlier stuff . favorite tracks : bed sleeping - " bed sleeping , love making , you know , love , i am yours taking . " lift us up - " people , don't you wonder how lord brought you under ? " only someone running - " if you melted , then i would melt myself all into you	1
" born usa " bruce best selling but also most misunderstood album . music very catchy more more commercial " pop " sound than his earlier records . fact , it produced 7 hit singles which also received heavy airplay mtv . this all contributed bruce transformation rock outsider pop culture icon - almost point parody . but bruce , through his integrity authenticity , managed hold his true identity continue make great music . this album doesn't reach artistic heights bruce best work , such " darkness edge town " or " born run " . but springsteen still writing high quality songs , including standouts like " no surrender " glory days " . yes , this pop music . but it still better than 98% other pop music out there . despite upbeat tempos joyful melodies most these songs dark overcast them , springsteen includes his usual cast working class characters bottom economic ladder desperate find better life . these aren't corporate bigshots benefitting " reaganomnics " 1980 . but regular joes whom " american dream " still mostly fantasy yet come true . course , reason this album so often misunderstood many people took title track jingoist anthem rather than bitter tale ex-vietnam vetern it clearly . this isn't bruce best album . but it still one well worth owning .	1
nice companion volume bob seger original greatest hits album 1994 , " greatest hits 2 " not only focuses seger latter-day material , it also goes long way towards making up fact " greatest hits " featured more ballads less rock n'roll than average bob seger concert including grinding rockers like " katmandu " , " rock roll never forgets " " fire down below " . there ballads here too , though , it good thing there , because title track seger " beautiful loser " album one his best slow songs . among lesser-known songs two latter-day sides " manhattan " " new coat paint " , well brand-new cuts " satisfied " " tomorrow " , two hard-rocking songs some his best music years . it shame " greatest hits 2 " , like its predecessor , ignores bob seger early cameo/parkway singles his first several lps well . but it still fine addition " greatest hits " , even if seger two live albums remain best introduction his music	1

wait new juliana hatfield album often more painful wait cd release should . thankfully ever it worth it . this amazing , fan reference point i'd say it sounds like lyrical bite bed combined heavy guitar riffage total system failure . wierd thing no matter how much distortion feeback it layered tunes still shine through , video bouncy little guitar tune i'd rather here blaring radio than ashley , kelly , lohan , et al . no offence , i'm quite fond some them but abscence juliana radio , television most magazines hurts my head sometimes . maybe her tendency break up cheery tunes jagged noise cussing time time puts people off , i don't know . everytime i read something her website where she sounding more more disillusioned record bix grind i fear she'll give up one day . however , time we fantastic juliana hatfield record gorge . here ( hopefully ) many more .	1
i've reading reviews say this cd pop album , it sounds like beatles and/or beach boys ..... i couldn't disagree more ....... it rock opera , if ever there one , finely tuned hip shakingly fabulous !! if you've never heard luke voice , you incredible surprize !! he draws you into his world lets you wade around his creativity . what more would you ask musical genius ? some songs tender make your soul swoon , some rock roll mantra , but all them stick your aura like glue . he chatting god through some it trying answer questions himself .... or perhaps , all us . personally , i like dancing around house luke god ... it like what forbidden , sweetened heavenly cosmos . oh , way , astrological aspects ?.... he got them ..... most intrinsically , talented muscians ...... keep dreaming , luke , we like mystical ride . cheers , kiw	1
this may fun listen ... 16 years ago . lot music back then aged into some best music all time . this not . this cd just not good honest you . it very immature ( which not bad thing ) , but you tell , like reviewer below me said , they lived off controversy not true talent . if you want some real rap , or just good music general , i think you should look elsewhere	-1
this my most favorite cd ever . performance delivered this band nothing short breathtaking . style guitarist very original unique . style singer amazing , he write poetry better than any famous poet so truthful personal , it just gets you . his voice sounds so intense also . drums very moody , range sweet , soothing beat hardcore pounding . thing this band live show far best you ever see . they cover amps stage flower petals singer holds boquet flowers starts thrashing it around when music starts . singer flail his arms spin around fall ground while telling his emotional confessional message audience , drummer beast pounds his drums like madman , guitarist swing his guitar uncontrolled uncoordinated ways all around his body . bassist saunter around stage if searching some sort answer . it truly amazing show take your breath away . ticket see them worth any amount money . live show far better than cd also . please support this band . even though this band christian they not all preachy type , they deliver their beliefs way makes you want comfort him or praise lord him . if you aren't already believer don't surprised if their music and/or live show makes you believer	1
this my personal favorite . it shame mccain doesn't greater following . everything this album poetic every sense . instrumentation fantastic lyrics , true brilliance music , amazing . there fantastic acoustic version " i'll " quieter , tamer features lyrics , though it loses wonderful saxophone pieces song trademark . true , this album quieter all around , noteable exception " anything good me , " which really only ' rock ' song here . " beautiful life " " just your thing " eloquent commentaries life today . though this album doesn't much upbeat tunes like " guinevere " or " alive " common edwin mccain earlier albums , it poetic moving . edwin mccain best songs rarely released radio waves anyone who misses them really missing out	1
this album includes all spinner hits ! my favorite songs it shame , i'll around could it i'm falling love . this one best albums party . it may 60 , but it never get old	1
first all my rating album me 3 stars but , i am big ripp fan so 4 rating out respect . this album more same russ freeman , modern smooth-jazz flair latin style . me they just haven't same since left grp 96 , there only good album me outside label brave new world ( 96 ) back then they're style lot faster , cunning bold , russ band would times almost cross line rock pop back smooth jazz sheer brilliance , last few albums nothing different , everyone else . exception song ( end ) album okay .	1
then just pick up appetite destructionafd one greatest rock albums ever made . i wanted hate album so much . i alternative/avant guard snob when afd released . me , these clowns just hairspray band . but i took long car trip some chick i banging her roommate . roommate played tape least three times trip . end , i hooked . that mark truly great art . if it draw someone who predisposed hate it , its got something special . i looked forward next album , ' lies . but when it came out , i disappointed . it ok , but hardly cultural epoch afd . nice boys kind fun . used love her humorous novelty song . mama kin decent cover , but no real improvement over original . rest disk just crap . but what hell , its just ep right ? something tide us over until next brutal masterpiece . then came gnr death knell , two use your illusions . over-produced , bloated , boring pretentious . everything i always hated hair-metal first place . gone sound alley ways sunset boulevard , replaced sound computers , maids beverley hills hookers blow parties . rock roll sung guy custom-ripped jeans who just came out session his hair stylist manicurist . nothing see here . move . so , if you want see genius promise gnr , just pick up appetite destruction , pretend they just broke up after creating one greatest albums all time	1
i think . geils band real talented band although i'm only casual fan them but they sure make some good music i'll never forget first time i heard whole version give it me song me floored , i wish house party : anthology full version instead edited version cause edited version doesn't it me like full version , other songs really good i remember hearing whammer jammer problem child 2 years ago i didn't know who artist , i surprised it one only , . geils band , my only gripe it doesn't hold your loving this cd but only minor issue me , if you're new fan . geils band , this good way start get this cd instead flashback	1

o.k. , i certainly understand criticism " movement , " new order first album . most songs sound like they're remnants joy division , both bernard sumner peter hook , sound like they're trying desperately conjure up ian curtis vocals wake his unfortunate suicide year before ( 1980 ) . most songs kind doom-and-gloom feel , eerie lyrics , so typical joy division ( i.e. " denial " : " here i am house full doors but no exits/ light grey like stains my windows " ; " truth " : " oh it strange day/ such lonely way/ i saw some children dance/ i watched my life trance " ) . although , perhaps , band still searching its own voice , i still like new order " movement " quite alot , much , fact , any pre- " republic " album . other reviewers noted , first song " dreams never end , " least representational song album , foreshadows some new order best work future albums . its main riff also pretty much lifted cure song " days . " ( that o.k. -- new order , later albums , borrowed cure " forest " " just like heaven , " its songs " sunrise " " all way " ) . break-out dance song " movement , " , course , " chosen time , " which really should included " substance " album . its infectious bass guitar riff , " chosen time " rates one new order greatest obscure classics . i also like last three songs ( " him , " " doubts even here , " " denial " ) which , again , though clearly evocative joy division , provide true flavor this album . one criticism : some songs include extraneous sounds merely unnecessary distractions melody . overall though , i personally enjoy " movement , " much band follow-up , " power , corruption lies , " which i also awarded four stars . course , pcl marked new order clear break its haunted past	1
i found myself alone listen quot ; still watersquot ; . it honest raw airy way morcheeba presents themselves . this album worth buying if song alone	1

bep one my favorite hip-hop acts late 90 . their debut album " behind front " even their sophomore album " bridging gap " continued musical approach ideology more akin tribe called quest , talib kweli , de la soul , roots than current gangster rap trend . after this however , bep apparently figured out they make more money intellectually depraved dance tracks than they original music . it shame . money business perfect example album crafted bottom top pop appeal . 2004 ( elephunk ) bep left artistic music community joined commercial music community . it sad see them go	1
i stumbled across this year it came out when visiting friend slo town during his college years . quot ; yellow pillsquot ; such interesting song i take chance . i still album . it one albums my humble ( not really ) opinion one top 5 or 10 albums epitomizes early new wave style . i recorded this road trip cassette , ( american ) beat other , which i would say makes same list . though i heavily into punk time , i still open ( musical ) mind . i never heard second session cd , but i am going purchase this solely their first effort , save vinyl posterity . go it	1
you missing out you haven't listened this one . some best music so far . this one awesome !!	1
this exceptional collection . recorded two decades ago it still over all best set haydn london symphonies . haydn remarkable career notorious among other things encompassed mozart life , witness beethoven start . most remarkably still he able evolve adapt changing music he heard through life . court composer who defined what symphony would then , he listened enriching genius mozart wrote his set london symphonies 1791 1795 . there his very own genius clearly shows , writing music little envy later mozart masterpieces . 60 haydn went court composer playful entertaining music high quality almost pre romantic composer subdued but real passion , impeccable taste , thoughtful meditation . then he just went his third career mass oratorio composer . secret interpret haydn understand , he serious composer , not showman like mozart or passionaria like beethoven . haydn ever gentleman his music should always played restraint elegance , even more extroverted pieces like these . colin davis succeeds admirably create unrivalled ensemble . certainly , you find individual symphony here there " better performance " than what mr. davis serves here . but virtues here ensemble , scope over total 12 symphonies rolling 4 cd 70 + minutes each . mr. davis `s work here simply tremendous feat , unmatched . bargain prices it steal	1
pearl jam , me , always interesting band listen . they became household name their smash debut album ten their sophomore album vs . but ever since then , it seems like they've shying away spotlight . it not they didn't hits - " better man " , " who you " , " last kiss " , " given fly " all chart-climbers - but they nonetheless significantly less famous than they used . perhaps this gives them room try out many new things they their albums . nonetheless , this album proves , pearl jam show they rock out now just good they used , but perhaps even more passion . i sort-of caught off-guard after putting cd into my player " life wasted " - i not expecting it so loud , especially beginning , i admit i jumped out my seat . yeah , this song basically defines term " rock " . probably highlight album full them , song starts off simple ac/dc-riff , intensity maintained through end ( which yields mighty-fine guitar solo , i might add ) . " world wide suicide " immediate turn-on any listener , opening strains catchy chorus rollicking ending . catchiest song album , i dare you not scream " world wide suicide ! " eddie vedder . it very hard . this also perhaps pearl jam greatest lyrical moment ever - imagery beginning , " morning paper " , very striking . " comatose " short segway song , but cool groove some nice guitar effects . eddie vedder voice seems awfully strained , however , particulary during breakdown after second chorus . " severed hand " just may " druggie " anthem 2006 . it pretty obvious it drugs , just listen lyrical imagery during verses . main riff reminiscent " smells like teen spirit " , it weird off-kilter chorus , it finishes spiraling guitar solo . put those kids shame . " marker sand " just may best song album - blending angst-ridden verses beautiful , lighter-waving chorus brillant . best all-around song lyrically album , it points finger god , asking him where he all this mess , without denying him . " parachutes " beautiful , beatle-esque song nice change pace , but gets old two minute mark . main reason this same thing happens whole song no instrumental breakdown . it still nice song listen , however , fits within album . " unemployable " lyrical masterpiece , lyrics man without job . song seems okay until great chorus , repeating line so catchy , you'll replaying this song over over hear it again . " big wave " cool surfer anthem , some weird-but-incredibly-awesome guitar effects . more substance would've made better dividends , but good song nonetheless . " gone " springsteen-esque masterpiece haunting it heart-warming , happy it depressing . anything borrows line legendary pete townshend ( am i right ? ) very good , this shows . " wasted reprise " just some short b-3 work repeated line " life wasted " . nice segue into next song . " army reserve " uses some u2-like guitar effects very nice lyrical imagery . instrumental outro very nice too . " come back " slow-burning bluesy song good its own right , but more or less disrupts flow album . " inside job " epic masterpiece . it begins some chilling guitar work two minutes , then come vocals ... music slowly rising , slowly rising ... then ... yes !! everything comes together end , but when it stops , it really not finished , it resonate you long after you hear it . mighty fine effort band loaded ' em . if you any doubts pearl jam before , please qualm them now , because when pearl jam releases great album after this one , you can't possibly go critiquing them .	1

zimmer wrote thin red line assistance john powell . now glennie-smith writes orchestral score vietnam war drama . " what war ? " starts low strings then transitions militaristic percussion soft french horn playing main theme . " look around you " starts off bit emotional low strings sounding almost funeral like distant-sounding bell clangs . around 2 minutes 45 seconds , low strings grow silent replaced ticking clock soft , high-pitched stings slowly builds tension low strings soldiers leaving their homes go off war . track ends high strings soft brass blows . " flying high " good track which dominated vocals . male voice sings opening track then songs tenses up high strings female voice helicopters carry soldiers battlefield . " final battle " only action song bunch , if i even call it " action " . it starts same male voice " flying high " then turns into tense , electronic percussion section before fading into long , quiet solo male voice . " final departure " most heartbreaking song . it very mournfully played mainly strings . it ends solo trumpet salute troops their sacrifice . wonderful score . sadly , glennie-smith hasn't anything big states since then . i eagerly await his next big project randall wallace . until then , pick this one up thin red line , saving private ryan , band brothers great raid . if you're fortunate enough find it , pick up u-571 well	1

" lastly , favorite hhh hit mine , " more show . " steve sounding bit sharp beginning but his voice starting even out makes song very neat many enjoy this song because they say it tells story . i love this song , i don't doubt you , too . if you not convinced you should buy knock knock knock then , i think you might need some therapy . you should also buy makeup breakdown so you don't little 5 songs hot hot heat because they're so amazing you need 15 just get .	1

feel this disc immediately makes itself known its listener : brit-pop stylings what only described minimalist scandinavian-style backbeat . vocalist voice top , sweet form , providing wonderful contrast atmospheric thumping going behind her . extremely listenable whether you're yourself , or need some background friendly gathering . track #5 , its reference behind wheel quot ; capriquot ; , confirms credibility this band continental origins . track #10 ( i think ) quot ; erica americaquot ; , best songs harkens global image promise america provides . this cd no mistakes , no missteps , no regrets	1
this new record former manitoba involvee dan snaith relatively short , naturalistic trip . track titles , artwork , music evoke usually-innocent pastel mind-wanderings , complete background saturation effects . several tracks short interludes which despite their short length very enjoyable listen . " subotnick " , " bees " , " hello hammerheads " employ sparse vocals which lend album more personal feel .

i misgivings when i heard divine miss doing christmas album ( jewish gal all ) it seemed just way make some money , ( i know streisand two ) , but i pleasantly surprised . this one her best efforts ! she sounds great , song choices good arrangements , cover alone worth purchase ! bette wisely steers away overly religious songs ( emmanuel generic enough cover both faiths ) . i especially liked title tune ( which i'd never heard ) steve allen . duet johnny mathis isnt up her duets manilow , but still fun . hawaiian mele kalikimaka campy fun goes back bette hawaiian roots . she covers chestnuts like i'll home christmas yourself merry christmas like pro . reworking her hit , distance , christmas song , inspired highlight album . i saddened read liner notes arif mardin , prouducer who helped launch midler died , album dedicated him . my only complaint like all bette releases late , set too short ( i found out target version extra song , too late ! ) . also why white christmas again ? she covered rosie clooney tribute . christmas song would better choice . aside quibbling , i loved it . this one christmas cd you play over over years come .	1

years i've read this fluke success band defied labelling . album gets 20th-anniversary status - still selling well - got grammy this year - well , somehow i don't really see fluke . i see it what it - superior musicianship , top-notch writing , instantly recognizable voice brings listeners places few others . when this album first came out , it rarely left my stereo ; now , twenty years , i four copies it i am aware - it possible there more , numerous relocations my part ; if i couldn't find my current copy after moving somewhere , i apt just go buy save time . this apex dire straits , their absolute shining moment ; it showed mark knopfler guitar master he , well his unmatched talent penning good songs . he deserves all accolades he gotten bringing this watershed effort fans everywhere . there nothing say music hasn't already said , other than personal favourites album without bad song it ; " ride across river " , which i could not listen sitting down ; " man too strong " , which fairly spooky ; " walk life " ( i busker australia relate ) , one his most upbeat songs ; ubiquitous " money nothing " which drove former employer crazy every time i played it ( 20 years , i'm still love guitar riff , though i'm sure mark knopfler tired it ) . this band may left critics scrambling description , but they knew how make their adoring fans happy way few bands ever accomplished . it says something people who loved them then still - point making this album 20-year event .	1

jill sobule obscure artist . though she labored over decade now , she only gotten tiny taste commercial success . this crying shame . maybe people shy away thinking she going precious folk-singing , lillith fair refugee ? maybe she too smart general public , who miss irony her songs ? could . her one hit , " i kissed girl " tongue-in-cheek commentary lesbian chic but it unfairly branded her gay performer , which she not ( not , quote " seinfeld , " there anything wrong ) . likewise , her other minor hit , soundtrack film " clueless , " " supermodel , " song shallow young girls shallow aspirations which taken many endorsement such empty dreams . really , i view her more wry , randy newman sensibility cyndi lauper-esque voice . her music very poppy , classic ' 60s ' 70s way ( carole king , kinks , early bowie ) , [ ... ] . she knack taking serious and/or dark subject matter very light , hilarious manner ( prozac users " happy town " album same name , extra-marital affairs " girl affair " her self-titled cd ) . she shines light desperate outsiders compassion ( i.e. , " mary kay , " her ode ms. latorneau " pink pearl " ) . here , " underdog , " it central theme all songs . washed-up showbiz personality joey heartherton ( " joey " ) , chubby young queers making ( " underdog victorious " ) , cokehead couple ( " last line " ) israeli prostitutes ( " tel aviv " ) , jill presents them all delicate balacing act tenderness back-handed comedy . think her christopher guest pop . music here buoyant tuneful any you'll encounter . all all , this collection may just her best yet ... that high praise , indeed . you should really check this unjustly neglected artist out - she smart , funny , writes fantastic pop songs . , if you're still skeptical , consider this review comes guy who also counts zappa , little feat , tom waits favorite artists	1

look sharp !, joe jackson debut album , also his best . he yet turn into crank here , lyrics filled righteous anger biting humor . " sunday papers " attack press sensationalizing things , expresses how i felt when murder campus my old school made newspapers tv news , leading fellow alumnus telling me he'd never wear school jacket there meet his favorite actress , well my feelings how news sensationalizes crimes people mental disabilities , which promotes discrimination against them . " she really going out him ? " " happy loving couples " humorously satirize romantic breakups , " one more time " " throw it away " show guy dissing his girlfriend wanting romantic vacation country regularly arrests foreign tourists trumped-up crimes , which not surprising considering jackson belief young australian tourist jailed indonesia drug-smuggling charges unjustly convicted . only problem this cd it too perfect ; joe jackson would equal it follow-up , then swiftly decline .	1

fratres my favorite this cd . it so crisp , so cutting , so absolutely gorgeous it nearly makes me cry every time i hear it . i used hate violin music . i guess i'm getting old , ( i'm 21 ) because this stuff just absolutely cuts my heart . it not overly complicated music mushes around , it like bared knife , simply elegantly lifting out your innards , higher , domain . buy this cd	1

monster hit when it opened 1954 , still staple community theatre groups , pajama game delightfully refreshing score never takes itself too seriously . whole it offers better-than-average number stand-out songs : " i'm not all love " , " hey there " , " small talk " , " steam heat " , " hernando hideaway " ensmble " 7 1/2 cents . " there , however few stumbles . " new town blue town " dreary . " her " silly although bob fosse dance routine made it work stage . both these dropped movie version , so i suspect authors also felt this material weak . movie retained all original cast leads except janis paige babe ( replaced doris day . ) day sings babe songs better , so your choice cast album movie soundtrack depend whether you need whole score or not . ths reissue ... once again sony first-rate job . sound full bodied rich , though necessarily mono , package includes some well-written liner notes	1
i think herbie hancock one most influential men jazz scene after miles . his music very variable just like ' chameleon ' one his hit tracks album ' head hunter'may , you think herbie music fusion electric sound . or his careers miles many more musicians mainstream jazz . but herbie music herbie hancock himself ! it chameleon ' who ' change his colors easily surrounded environment . herbie music colors same things chameleon he taught us his amazing abilities most becoming all jazz genre through many marvelous album music . this record maiden voyage also qualified something else . album genre called modal jazz . song - same name album title - 1st track " maiden voyage " typical modal theory . just like many men loving jazz , i don't know jazz theory well either . but true attraction this piece beautiful melody . example , first last track , " maiden voyage " " dolphin dance " most perfomed jazz standard . sometimes , because its beautiful melodies this record more relaxant easy appreciate rather than hard bop or funky jazz , etc ... though you not hard jazz cat , this " maiden voyage " bring great inspiration you . if you begin hearing this music , you might under delusion you quiet sea . this great most beautiful album . don't hesitate buy something else	1

i write this review because this band lyrics music haunting my soul past year or so , particularly last three months following release " love , loss , hope , repeat " . i picked up advance copy cd month before it came out , after i already huge fan their last cd , " indian summer " . cd , incidentally , nearly flawless every way . so much so i convinced no band could ever reproduce piece art like twice . however , " love ... " not only matches brilliance " indian ... " , but it equally par every way . no pictures look no liner notes read , i let music speak itself . boy oh boy , it ever . after repeated listens , not only it get better better but i want hear it again all more . this band managed get very close fire greatness crafting music supremely higher order . i felt like they my own , i got go see them play this tour little club rhode island , they took it even higher level . carbon leaf actually amazing band see perform live concert . i'm already wishing i could fly down virginia see them again . i'm certain next time i see them , it arena . i wish they could stay ' mine ' forever , but not going happen . they poised brink ready explode , i can't wait see it . this semi-jaded music lover not rabid fan band very long time . look , after lifetime buying cds listening music , i've learned one thing . there only two types music , good music bad music . carbon leaf great music . go ahead . enjoy , world	1

no nostalgia here , just objectivity . very hard mclennan recent passing . i found last 2 lps reformed duo : welcomed , eagerly anticipated , ok , perhaps i expected too much creators one my 5 d.i.d. lps all time . they nice , but not over top this duo who given us so much beautiful music over years . actually i hesitated purchase this until flood great reviews forced my little lifeboat over precipice niagra . i popped it way home work one those early june evenings when sun alternately breaking thru potentially dam busting summer shower skies mid atlantic usa . first track ok , nice chug . nice mix . haven't heard this since " there anything ... " urgent . then lp just unfolds this cacophony sunshine gorgeous melodies then until end . i so stunned i called up friends held up phone yelled you remember groove these guys ? me don't this my age no more . this most stunning lp i heard past 5 years . this surpasses all your expectations it beauty , production , sheer magnitude its songwriting . it like way we ultimately want our musical friends return when they've away . lads saving up this . first 2 reformed lps i won't discount , but this time it like " 16 lovers lane " where they went brass ring ... they got it . i loved grant songwriting sighed over his lyrics so many years - group solo . but this lp , i finally tapped completely into robert - every one his songs perfect here . " part family " hilarious could song rest my life all those kindred souls who come wonderful wombs , but god knows why , we just gotta stretch out bit .

" courtesy they might giants ) but there pretty true . fow awesome group whom term " power pop " not justice . mostly this because word " pop " slimy grotesque . fow really put together good album b-sides rarites here , this especially appealing longtime fans group . this isn't best introduction band , but it hell lot better than hearing " stacy mom " ( most unjustly overplayed song ever . i mean really ! they such better songs ! ) over over over radio . this album excellent because it truly entertaining liner notes awesome collection classic fow b-sides their new single " maureen " , kickass song . " california sex lawyer : one my favorites album , if you read liner notes it even funnier . besides raucously funny lyrics , it excellent song that fun listen . " i want alien christmas " their infamously char t-t opping uk single . this song so badass . fact , other two holiday-themed songs awesome too . course , there " ... baby one more time " , which basically sparked ton other bands same thing acoustic covers this song , but this one recorded first . some kids my high school even baby one more time cover , i don't think they any clue who fow . oh well , it excellent song showcases their trademark sarcasm biting humor music . basically , you should buy this cd , because it cool , fow really cool . great collection tracks great band	1

boc come kinda my favorite act representing feelings , or life itself , true it actually - therefore after 4 months mental boc-listening after hours spent their homepage-wonderful-wierdo-games [ they're no longer :( ] , i saw new album released boy i happy . tchp truly wonderful , but not all like i thought it would ; more dark , sincere or serious feeling , or maybe like your inside soundings ' true self - but that " over all " . first part track 8 " sherbert head " probably best piece music i know , getting chills every now then i listen it . other " dark " half it accompanies first half just it should - even though one could listen intro forever . sherbert head album " final " track i see it " slow this bird down " two out-of-this-world tracks cd . but without setting other songs , well , it all small things we all know . can't wait ' til release trans canada highwa	1
album sit down , relax , think how this world falling apart , but it gives hope same time . mariah performance best one my opinion	1
world ever evolving so music . people criticize what dh doing his music , but we must remember he doing it unto lord -- no one knows his heart relationship lord , but him lord . i believe this music reflection his love lord , but most importantly his love obtain new audience -- lost souls relationship lord -- if only thru music . we all remember purpose music . i say i love new cd . i've recommended many people continue so	1
bob dylan may alone stage philharmonic hall during most this 1964 concert , but he friendlier , even gregarious times , he jokes audience even requests their assistance when he forgets opening verse " i don't believe you . " he entertainer here , role he seems reclaimed recent years he barnstorms world never ending tour . otherwise , this concert finds him transitioning relatively idealistic troubadour " times they are-a changin '" more cynical , introspective poet " it alright , ma ( i'm only bleeding ) . " latter performance highlight this collection . dylan would perform this song many times decades come , but only rarely effectively he 1964 when it new still five months away its appearance " bringing it all back home . " dylan clearly enunciates each word , no doubt impressed his achievement , but also intent audience experience it fully . joan baez turns up four songs , best which duet " mama , you my mind . " but most memorable moments when dylan his own , offering excellent readings " don't think twice , it all right , " " lonesome death hattie carroll , " " hard rain a-gonna fall . " i prefer later , post-64 dylan , therefore , rank this set below previous entries " bootleg series . " but it terrific concert makes particularly intriguing listening experience when one contrasts it 1966 1975 concerts . brian . fairbanks	1
this recording joni mitchell sounds like she singing bad piano bar . never thought she'd lounge singer . i've listened this cd only once because i want remember her joni mitchell sixties seventies	1

incubus just knows how make good music . even though morning view not science , its great album . i don't know how you call this album soft . sure its not hard or fast old incubus , but its not soft . morning view more upbeat uplifting album , but it some heavy hard rifts it . lyrics sound great well , it some addictive hooks it . i hate when people get stuck certain style band might one point . all bands go though different phases their music , incubus no different . i'll first too admitt old incubus albums rocked , i loved funk style made science so great . but i also appreciate new incubus , make yourself now morning view both great albums . this more mature sounding incubus , it something different brandon guys . i personally am glad morning view not retread science or make yourself . fortunatly us , incubus not band continues pump out same album over over again . they what they should , thats make different soundng album every time , they great it . i'd rank this one my top 3 incubus albums , other two science make yourself . anyways , i find this really well made album . many songs could singles , it very diverse album appeal alot different people . i bought this album when it came out 2001 , i'm still listening it today , 2006 . i think speaks itself how good it . bottom line morning view great album alot offer	1

i don't want start arguments 100th window but this album much better . it more electronic feel that closer 100th window , however it much needed edge 100th window missing . this album totally instrumental but most tracks enjoyable nonetheless . i would recommend using this more background music because it gets very slow times fit movie . production still very good tracks show creativity darkness made massive attack so popular . i rated unleashed soundtrack 3 stars because bonus tracks suck severely	1
i never listened joe , no idea who he until my boyfriend i started going long drives up mountains he constantly playing joe cds . this first cd catch my attention , i totally fell love it !

one who thought ricky skaggs " brand new strings " bit too mellow lacked usual bluegrass drive , i pleased hear hard edge back this instrumental album . although instrumentation feel definitely bluegrass , it nice variety tunes ( major keys , minor keys , appalachian , celtic ) . few tunes include non-bluegrass instruments , such accordian and/or clarinet . my opinion , it worked well , but i see where purist might find it disconcerting . two tunes ( " going ceili " " crossville " ) also " live charleston music hall " album . i would preferred either all new tunes , or make it mega-album all his instrumentals , including " get up , john , " " rawhide , " " amanda jewell , " so . definitely great album bluegrass fans	1

since this review after kamelot released two later cd , it rare instance able look forward future instead usual longing past . music here better than previous ( fourth legacy ) growing toward brilliance epica black halo . khan voice noticely developed band overall performance sharper than former but much more improvement awaits latter . however , kamelot less-than-perfect works better than best music lot other bands easily rates four marks . ( please see my profile brief discussion my rating philosophy . )	1
i've lingering over this cd past few weeks finally decided buy it so happy i so . this all i've listening past few days . great opener ' good morning baltimore ' best closing song i've ever heard , ' you can't stop beat ' , this recording gem . one my favorite songs this soundtrack ' nicest kids town ' . it kind beat that hard not dance . favorite ' mama , i'm big girl now ' . it reminds me songs leslie gore . my favorite line comes amber von tussle " once upon time i used dress up ken/but now i'm woman i like bigger men/and i don't need barbie doll show me how " . ' ( legend of)miss baltimore crabs ' glorious song villain . wonderful drumming violins background , velma von tussel great solo song . ' it takes two ' such great slow song . i just imagine 1960 prom . everyone slow dancing lights low . band set up stage . i can't help sing . ' welcome 60 ' wonderful song . it seems everyone favorite . it one mine too . harvey fierstein great edna . ' big , blonde , beautiful ' good song . good message all big girls proud yourself . ignore what everyone says you strut . " bring pecan pie/pour some sugar it/sugar don't shy "' (you're ) timeless me ' such cute song wilbur edna . ' without love ' my number one favorite this recording . link proclaiming his love tracy who locked up solitary confinement seaweed proclaiming his love penny who tied up her bed . " darling i'll yours forever/'cause i never wanna be/without love/so darling throw away key "' i know where i've ' glorious gospel song . sung motormouth maybelle her experiences learned them . ' cooties ' such childish sounding song but it kind song should it own dance . it too much fun . little song follows ' you can't stop beat ' so funny dark . i don't know name , i just refer ' blood pavement ' . " don't drink drive/please keep your head/or come graduation day/you'll dead " . i recommend this soundtrack everyone . it kind soundtrack doesn't sound like musical soundtrack	1
i saw mastodon unholy alliance tour last year they stole show . there music just perfect blend heavy metal . id recommend this cd anyone who enjoys metal . this cd doesnt disappoint neither these guys .	1
there some comments previous reviews regarding this album length/number songs , " angry eyes " " edit " . first , this originally vinyl album , which explains its length , " greatest hits " album , it contain songs lm most known time , least casual radio listeners . second , notes album jacket explain " angry eyes " , fact , not edited ( cut ) this album . rather , version this collection alternate " short " version recorded same time original " long " version their second album . i , too prefer full version , but least this short version more cohesive feel than most songs get cut down ( engineers ) time . anyone who really into lm , course , won't satisfied just this collection , but it few things recommend it . it , after all , collection lm songs , you can't go wrong - no matter how you slice it . if ( my case many years ago ) casual listener buys this collection then seeks out more lm albums , then it its job . after all , i didn't become really avid lm fan i am until i started listening appreciating entire " loggins messina " album , which i bought specifically full version " angry eyes " . also , this album contains stand-alone " single " version " peace mind " . song here identical what their " sittin ' " album , except it begins its own , rather than beginning segue " make woman feel wanted " . this version handy if you wish make your own expanded " best " compilation , but don't wish include entire " trilogy : lovin ' me/to make woman feel wanted/peace mind " . any rate , this good taste loggins messina ( their band ) fine songwriting musicianship , it whets appetite more .	1
if you're vu fan you haven't heard this album , it bad reviews or people just plain saying it hard listen , you should still give it try . one thing , lou reed really gets crazy his guitar i heard her call my name , creating feedback squeals make you want cover your ears . it really second side this album makes it what it ; sure , first side some good songs , but roar second side really embodies this album purpose , which i believe make album 1968 sounded like something no one ever imagined . there other people doing proto-punk , like electric prunes before them , but sheer loudness fury , no one could top this album . it sounded like garage rock , but completely stripped down pure noise . without andy warhol or nico , they really able free record whatever they wanted . i mean , sister ray 17 minutes long , if you're into sort thing , you'll fun time listening it . otherwise , you'll get bored quickly . i personally think it varies enough keep someone interested . there virtually no chord changes seventeen minutes straight , it mainly becomes battle guitar freaked out distorted organ . i think i read somewhere engineer walked out studio during recording song , simply saying , " call me when you're . " you could play this song 16 year old like me they would never believe it came 1967 . it just doesn't sound like sixties today . funny thing it didn't sound like sixties sixties ! i recommend this album , but warned : this abrasive difficult 1967 ever got . ale	1

neil diamond may throaty quality his voice but he still records same ac style songs wonderful manilow . difference manilow relied more thoughtful ballads while diamond recorded mostly mid/up-tempo love songs like quot ; cracklin ' rosiequot ; , quot ; cherryquot ; , quot ; americaquot ; , quot;i'm believerquot ; . us manilow fans , it bit more reality but every now then song like quot ; copacabanaquot ; allowed us escape world forget misery bad or lousy relationship . but , manilow songs spoke me personally because i've quite few awful relationships women hearing song like quot ; weekend new englandquot ; hits home . previous reviewers all made comments song selections this cd . this one full manilow ac hits ... five songs made top-10 pop chart : quot ; could it magicquot ; hit #6 , quot ; copacabanaquot ; hit #8 , quot ; i write songsquot ; hit #1 , quot ; somewhere nightquot ; hit #9 , quot ; weekend new englandquot ; hit #10 . each those top-10 pop singles bigger ac charts , that one big reason why some songs may not familiar public large . quot ; this one youquot ; , example , hit #29 pop but flew #1 ac . everyone knows quot ; copacabanaquot ; it #8 pop peak 1978 belies it massive popularity . it sold million copies remained #1 ramp ; ac chart incredible 5 weeks ! prior this , four other manilow singles each sold million or more copies . quot ; beautiful musicquot ; , quot ; jump shout boogiequot ; , quot ; all timequot ; album songs not hit singles . quot;you're my only girlquot ; , his newly recorded song 1989 , closes out cd . it wonderful song , showing manilow still quite bit range his voice ... it follows award winning masterpiece quot ; i write songsquot ; this cd . i would've closed cd song ... new song track #9	1

big ben played so many greats tender age 50 kind came into his own here ... his blues his sound pretty unique distinguishable he valued one top his genre .. this cd lot soul indeed fits smokey bar because some cuts so bluesy sounding very kansas city ... sound he captures " kings " such coleman hawkins " sweets " edison other sides all coming out around this 2o year period smacks genre jazz history whose heart emotions very hard match . lovely package , booklet added tracks .	1
" inside " got most cohesive innovative concept album ever released . alice great knack incorporating his personal experiences into humorous provocative songs just grab you throat ingrain themselves into your psyche like really good stephen king story . songs this lp based actual people alice encountered during his stay psychiatric hospital he voluntarily entered seek treatment his alcoholism . stories involve characters ranging man obsessed his dog compulsive gambler couple who hacked female husband into little pieces . latter song , " millie billie " , tender duet sung alice marcy levy fades sound circular saw grinding millie poor spouse bits . also included couple personal songs alice penned . " how you gonna see me now " beautiful ballad written form letter sheryl cooper , alice wife , which he expresses his insecurities over whether or not mrs. cooper love her man diminished result his ordeal . loaded great musicianship people like steve lukather , david foster rick nielsen , our peek into " inside " concludes exuberent haunting anthem , " inmates ( we're all crazy ) " . i'm huge fan alice some thirty-five years , i consider this ambitious gem his best work . truly great album i would consider same class great works like " sgt . pepper " . it crime warner ceased u.s. availability it , but that par course record label that notorious not valuing their great artists .	1
this one my top 10 cds all time . check out my other reviews you'll probably surprised . but this cd left lasting impression me when i like 16 or so . it some most well-crafted sy songs my opinion some sweetest , sublime , fuzzed out guitar sounds ever . track 1 perfect song . track 2 ( junkie promise ) rocks harder than anything they've ever . they played it conan obrien tore it up !!! track 3 beautfully hypnotic tripped out sort way . this track first reeled me i under influence wild irish rose watching my friends play tekken 2 . track 4 ( washing machine ) very episodical visual song which morphs dischordant punk chill summery breeze jam slowly winds down into practically nothing . kim gordon snotty tuff girl attitude shines through more than ever songs like ' little trouble girl ' ' panty lies ' . how any true fan alternative music hate this cd ? good experimentation noise distortion , yet structured songs ... better than previous " expermmental jet set " album . give it whir	1

what other music you folks listen ? i've always enjoyed apples ' discs single listen , nothing more ; music rather superfluous . i'm growing rather tired whiny voiced robert schneider , not mention his electronically enhanced nasal whine heard many these tunes . comparing guy brian wilson big mistake , just vocals alone , not mention songwriting skills . i'd compare him other wilson wannabes , like guy high llamas or others elephant 6 collective . essentially , disc full basic , repetitive 3-chord rock tunes , some back-up vocals ... occasional odd electronic instrumental track thrown , well ' kitchen sink ' assortment ' throwaways ' tossed good measure . poor-man fountains wayne jeff lynne complex , perhaps ? put some wondermints if you want listen band sounds like brian wilson !! or , better pop/indie sounds , pick up minders , long winters , or linus hollywood	1

blondie self titled debut came out 1976 , followed 1977 plastic letters . but it wasn't until 1978 parallel lines band exploded terms commercial critical acclaim . they would release one more equally great album form 1979 eat beat . but 1980 good but flawed autoamerican , it seemed like band striking out bit too many directions they weren't quite seasoned group point really pull it off . less said their final 1982 album hunter , better . after 17 long years , blondie surprised everyone coming out no exit 1999 . some accused them jumping whole reunion craze mid late 90 , but it really just case band got back together found out they still lot say musically enjoyed playing each other . no exit shares lot similarities autoamerican , but it succeeds all areas where autoamerican faltered . album sees group striking out everything their trademark pop-rock rap ( guest appearance coolio ) swing , country pretty much everything . most time album works . out 14 tracks , there only 4 i would call fillerish , but remaining 10 tracks strong , strong stuff . anybody who long time fan gave up them 1982 hunter , would wise check this album out it kind ignored general public ( least here states ) when it came out . while not front back strong their next album ( 2003 curse blondie ) , this still represents return form inimitable deborah harry boys	1

" last stand saber river " first three excellent westerns tom selleck made tnt 1997 2003 ( i'm still hoping there'll least fourth one some day ) . selleck starred five made-for-tv westerns total , three which based louis l'amour stories . this one , however , based book elmore leonard , difference obvious both lack idealism extreme violence . selleck paul cable , confederate cavalryman who come home civil war ( only slightly ) early . he knows war lost south , he worn out , he only wants take his family back their homestead arizona live normal life . his wife , who told he dead , less than thrilled him back home because she resentful he left fight war first place . suzy amis excellent job martha cable . she not stereotypical beauty who runs around bustle under fancy dresses . she tough frontierswoman who experienced many hardships gets her husband out some tight spots movie progresses . while majority movie good depicting divisions north south caused civil war which civil war then exacerbated , subplot inner struggles paul martha cable face far more interesting . it great movie until end , when we get additional time-worn subplot confederate soldier who just can't give up lost cause . no , it not selleck character who this problem , but selleck already covered this territory 1982 " shadow riders " ( though it wasn't his character who wanted keep fighting movie either ); john wayne " undefeated " well-known film lost cause plotline . spite needlessly melodramatic ending , this strong western . selleck tnt kept getting better better " crossfire trail " " monte walsh " . check out all three , you'll join me wishing number four	1

dean martin baritone famous rich smooth this christmas album , it also fun . his duet martina mcbride one best duets i've ever heard . it luscious their voices overlap follow each other beautiful dance . rest album enjoyable , although , it tends sound country , some reason . big band , jazz , swing fan , i wasn't necessarily crazy . bonus alternate versions included aren't really all different other tracks . but if you love dino christmas songs , you can't go wrong this one .	1

i confession make ... i am closet kutless fan . i enjoyed few their songs their self-titled review even found myself identifying " sea faces " before ccm chr made it most overplayed song year . worship album wasn't bad , seeing it several strong tracks few re-worked praise tunes i found myself enjoying . i bought hearts innocent amazon used since i wasn't exactly sure expect their new album ( youth pastor , i don't exactly all much money spend music ) . after listening this album , i found myself enjoying music little more , but lyrics lot less . i've always found kutless lyrics songwriting style their weakest point . they tend take two lines cliche followed thundering pre-chorus word or short-lived line repeated line chourus 3 or 4 times ( see pride away their first album ) . now , it seems they've found something say , i'm little worried message they're sending out . their first single , " shut me out " , interesting lyrical twist i honestly didn't expect kutless . essentially song seems ( notice i say seems , i could wrong i am not one who wrote song question ) say i'm going say what i've got say i don't care whether you agree me or not , i'm going put up you your differing opinions/argumenative ways so i speak my peace . other words , i'm right you're wrong but i'll put up you wrong so all rest these people see how right i am . seems bit sketchy me not quite message i'm shooting teach my students how live out their faith , because it not right , it loving god people god brings into their lives ( i know , someone start lecturing doctrine such , but attended graduated fundamentalist bible college , please save your time focus point this review , music/message band ) . their other single " smile " , also sends mixed messages . according song , my smiling good attitude , or perceived attitude , or seeing person smile , they light christ their lives . i am not exactly sure what that supposed mean . many christ-followers find themselves situations very much less than ideal , whether abusive relationships , poverty , or even disconnectedness church . many them don't go around smiling some sort " pie-in-the-sky/it all gonna ok " mindset . they hurt . they really hurt . so best we offer them smile ? i'd take some prozac over this sort " jeszac " they're selling my kids . conclusion , i'm not attacking ministry kutless , i think they reach people name jesus good things kingdom . i just happen disagree very strongly much unoriginal lyrics drab music they producing . just my opinion . feel free disagree me , but don't get angry start lecturing . i'm just contributing discussion doesn't get brought up nearly enough	-1

well , this said any " best " album , if you new artist . but kim richey case , this particularly true , because rise ( 2002 ) she departed quite dramatically sound her previous albums . proof what i'm saying , just scroll down lowest rating reviews rise see how many fans felt betrayed change . conversely , some those who discovered richey thanks rise disappointed her previous efforts . richey first three albums loosely catalogued " country-pop " , even though production becomes " glossier " she moves " kim richey " ( 1995 ) " glitter " ( 1999 ) . i suspect her record company yore , mercury nashville , behind this gradual but steady shift . however , since sales didn't materialize , they dumped her . free fetters , kim looked new sound describe her situation convey her emotions . " rise " born . understandably , lyrics bleak biographical ( when she sings " i never liked foreman standing over me " " girl car " i don't think she simply talking clich�s ; you agree me , guys mercury nashville ? ) but music also different . she producer bill bottrell must tinkering shop all sorts instruments when recording rise : melodica , birdie , vibraslap , mini-moog , bozouki , washtub bass , farfisa , wurlitzer present , among others . result singer-songwriter album irish middle-eastern influences . how some people find it bland , i don't know . you surely understood , i'm fond rise , but i also enjoy some songs her previous albums , especially her debut . instance , " just my luck " " i know " terrific songs , very catchy , but often other songs these three albums just unmemorable . new songs this collection , " electric green " stripped-down live version same title song rise " break you down " occupies same turf . it may indication richey stay course started rise . summarize : buy " collection " , see where you stand pick her precedent discography accordingly .	1

' 74 jailbreak fairly good album ac/dc , considering it actually compilation songs they recorded throughout 1974 1975 . only five songs kind disappointing though . 1 . jailbreak- one my all time favorites . it great rocker , it ridiculously catchy chorus . 10/102 . you ain't got hold me- this song just okay , but not terrible . guitar riff during verses good though . 7/103 . show business- this song good if you just feel like listening good , upbeat , bluesy song , but it gets old quickly . 7/104 . soul stripper- i really like this song , because it sounds different than most songs they before . phil rudd drumming percussion this song exceptionable . 9/105 . baby , please don't go- guitar this song amazing . very catchy . 8/10'74 jailbreak good purchase avid ac/dc fans , but not people only like " back black " " highway hell " . it worth buying just ' jailbreak ' though	1

this cd packed timeless music . rollins ' performance this classic 1957 not only solidified him one greatest tenors his generation , but , all other material his illustrious fifty plus year career , stood test time make him one all-time greatest musicians regardless style . backed duo legends bassist ray brown drummer shelly manne , rollins cooks beginning end . he prime form , still relativly unknown tenor when this album came out , he plays like man ahead his years . sonny tone hard , percussive , rasping , even playful , full spectrum colors moods . what makes this truly great album every single note rollins plays highlight . his soloing stands up repeated listening rewards effort something new each time through . manne brown contribute fantastic performances their own , matching rollins producing phenominal solos their own . even usually aggravating practice sticking alternate takes behind originals hardly makes difference . rollins , manne , brown so brimming ideas , longer alternates offer listener just much more good thing . this one those albums needs every jazz collection , even cover photo classic . buy this cd if you not already own it , you not dissapointed	1

" john also handles all bass , except " fiddler " larry klein josh jones . john drawn comparisons likes steve vai , it seems fitting both vai lee contribute . he quickly making name himself guitar world . songs sanity just original debut , but slightly more impressive . like vertigo , this track listing both metal bluegrass/country . here , however , songs sound like they performed more feeling maturity , which makes better album . one solo effort under john belt , he experience , it appears evident he made some technique adjustments	1
loved new sound , heavy beat , am looking forward their first full cd release may 4th ! funky lyrics too ! i certainly fan this music	1
it hasn't stated below reviews , it worthing point out " compound eye " set out old-fashioned double album . it all fits one cd but separated out into sides one through four . such , like any sef-respecting double album , it entitled desultory mess unified only it willlingness deviate style track track . " compound eye " succeeds kind white album lo-fi similar pop-smarts . it could said robert pollard nowadays looks backward main influences here could culled late seventies through early nineties . punk , no-wave , extreme lo-fi ( it daniel johnston or early smog ) , messy early-flaming lips rock ..... all evidence here . all filtered through resolutely indie early -r.e.m influence always inflection guided voices aswell ; my mind , similarities pollard stipe quite arresting though even stipe famed obscurity seems tame compared pollard abstruse lyrics . all all , album comes not really tribute but summation kind music pollard influenced , turn , went influence . again , white album comparison valid . but time , when hi-fi productions coming back into fashion sufjan stevens davendra banhardt previously lo-fi artists smog animal collective flaming lips joining fray , question ( this one could never asked beatles ) how relevant latest robert pollard album doesn't make any great progression previous releases either himself solo artist or guided voices . perhaps not very but then it always worth pickin up work artist who doing what he knows . " compound eye " , pollard it very well indeed that really all that relevant me	1
i played paul jones 15 years . his wife , bessy , raised me while my parents worked , back seventies . that how my brother sid i learned how play blues !!! this record wasn't pauls fist recording but it his first major label . this recording really good but you really see paul live catch showmanship he posesses . hats off mathew johnson bruce watson fat possum records oxford mississippi	1
i several traviatas my collection , it one my favorite operas , callas fan , i would often resort famous live recordings 1955 1958 order satisfy my fill her violetta . her early studio recording cetra didn't characteristics violetta yet would make it her own role . good her voice recording , it didn't dramatic elements gave her traviata heartbreaking qualities we come associate those two recordings . i am callas fan , i would admit , no one comes close violetta callas . but , there alternative those who aren't very close her voice . without compensating theatrics vocal beauty , here traviata well-rounded cast talented both vocally dramatically . first all , there romanian soprano ileana cotrubas . while her coloratura isn't accurate bel canto queens ' coloratura ( callas , sills , sutherland ) , her performance first acts spinto lyric coloratura outstanding . there feeling you get she woman who tries show good face partying crowd well . then duets sherril milnes , she expresses emotions much like those callas express . last act particularly heartbreaking , it this scene where i judge violetta creature only few sopranos such cotrubas create . difficult fioritura first act , most sopranos technique well-built tessitura easily manage it without paying much attention details drama , because partying voice quite easy replicate performance . second last acts though , more difficult . other supporting singers , i would argue domingo much more effective singer fat man , pavarotti . he gives great , heartbreaking performance alfredo , fact one best ones i've heard . lastly , conductor , carlos kleiber , gives one impression he able conduct seance verdi ghost . he truly knew score well , just like giulini , ghione , serafin , recently , patrick summers . i think one strongest points any recording conductor . if performance conducted beautifully , usually all you need make impression listener . listening kleiber conducting create palate imaginations would transport you easily world where this opera transpires , what conductors like summers , giulini , ghione , serafin , summers easily . five stars this one	1

this excellent collection songs . songs very lively entertaining . most stunning thing this cd reproduction quality . lot songs sound like like they just recently recorded , audio good . you hear big influence dick dale other musicians this cd . their second cd " lost legends surf guitar 2 " less surf oriented tunes more hot rod songs , it makes me wonder if i should bother buying third cd this collection . pyramids one top surf tunes " penetration " but two pyramid tunes here just sound like copies tune same minor sounding desending riff . this exciting collection songs all surf music fans . i also recommend their second cd even though it hot-rod tunes	1
i thought alicia first album , songs minor , okay but i blown away her second album ! alicia added amazing uptempo numbers like karma heartburn(which i felt should single ) . alicia writing good , but even better way she crafts her melodies . every song unique memorable . my personal favorites " karma " , " heartburn " , " dragon days " , " so simple " . " nobody , not really " amazing interlude i feel should full song ! give this cd listen because she matured better since songs minor	1

although rhyme style might dated give little tune up few key phrases rhyme patterns you all new hits . all beats , basslines , synths timeless if you listen first cypress hill album you'll notice grand wizard military scratch couple cuts . busy bee cuts perfect examples what real mc supposed sound like when he holding mike . his call response crowd . busy bee live cut should model all new rappers before they try perform front live crowd . all these cuts make you feel like your back parks south bronx . it goes without saying this classic	1
i downloading some shows when i came across show some band called galactic . i liked it but didn't think much it . then last week i saw counting crows live concert . when i got there , there this band jamming out . i saw second half their set , all time wondering quot ; who these guys ? quot ; then they announced they galactic . next day i went bought this cd i could not happier . blend funky blues-like singing , jazzy horn play , rock guitar riffs awesome . this band reminds me very much jazz trio called medeski , martin , wood . however , galactic offers great singing horns giving them much more diverse sound . me , this one those cd i don't know any song titles because whenever i listen it , i listen whole thing straight . if you like jazz you like jam bands , get this album	1
this my favorite kenny cd . all songs awesome , lyrics fun , meaningful sincere . i like when he incorporates good " lord " " family " some his music . it shows he got great values . kenny without doubt one best industry . some highlights me this album " how forever feels " ( where this beach ? ) , " you me hello " , " life good " , " baptism " ( rt awesome too ) , " everywhere we go " , " i might get over you " , rest just great . she thinks my tractor sexy very fun song . you fun your life order your life good . life short , live it fullest . go kenny !	1
back mid 90 , i dismissed pulp just britpop band . come find out , i wrong . good friend gave this me cd exchange i say i'm thoroughly impressed . standout tracks clearly ( imo ) " mis-shapes " , " common people " " i spy " . music rather jangly times distinctly dance-able beat . what won me over though lyrics . jarvis cocker manages create fantastic mental image go his lyrics , which alternately humorous serious , occassionally silly ( " sorted e wizz " ) vaguely malevolent ( " i spy " ) . cocker delivery very basic - he doesn't lot range , but he makes good use his voice some spoken parts songs send chills up my spine . all all , this great album . i wish i'd given it chance back 1995	1
born 1961 , i , until recently , not get much enjoyment popular music forties . passionate audiophile geek , i love exploring music all decades which there recorded sound . though my first flirtations hits 40 not go over well , i not give up . i came back decade . it rhino records wonderful two volume collection " songs got us through wwii , " really turned me around . i now find myself getting lots pleasure popular music this era . this collection : " g.i. jukebox , " complete winner , just like double rhino collection i mentioned , it transports one time american culture . sometimes cheesy ( nothing wrong ) , always pleasing hear , songs this disc warm relics bygone era . i highly recommend this compilation one all .	1
serse one my favorite handel operas since i first heard old priestman lp westminster ( maureen forrester title role , lucia popp romilda ) . despite its frequent raggedness quot ; harpsichord speedquot ; continuo , this thoroughly dramatic engaging performance . i've waited decades new serse which could benefit new performance standards we take granted baroque opera today . i strongly disposed like this disc , since although i've found mcgegan bit uneven past , his more recent handel efforts , particularly radamisto , superb . i can't fault singers or orchestra this performance , but dramatic spark makes serse so special seems me missing . i went back compared my old priestman recording even more convinced definitive serse yet come . it surprising there haven't more recordings , since this work lot potential appeal , one handel most accomplished pieces . maybe i'm just too picky , but i'd love see someone reissue priestman cd -- while they it , his equally engaging rodelinda ( fortunately , there better competition latter )	1
this best rocking , shouting , one cd overview black gospel 1947 1963 , produced man best qualified job , historian self-described gospel " monomaniac " anthony heilbut , who devoted his life music . if you like singing ray charles , aretha franklin , sam cooke , wilson pickett , whitney houston or lou rawls , or `60 soul motown or stax-volt - you'll love this cd . this where it all came . it all here , sweet falsetto crooners ( r.h. harris , claude jeter ) , church wrecking baritone shouters ( silas steele ) , earthshaking basso profundo ( classically trained . robert bradley , equally home german lieder or gospel shouting ) , choirs ( st. paul baptist church ) , quartets ( dixie hummingbirds , soul stirrers , swan silvertones ) , women ( mahalia jackson , clara ward , delores barret campbell ) , men ( brother joe may , professor alex bradford ) , one caught ( wilmer " little ax " broadnax , woman who lived her life man macho world male gospel quartet much admired tenor lead spirit memphis quartet ) . there not weak number this album , most gloriously good . there half dozen rare " spirit " " live " recordings , including rarely recorded legend queen . anderson , absolutely scorching swan silvertones medley segues searing dewey young baritone shout soaring claude jeter falsetto tour de force . i think it best thing ever captured this much recorded group . packaging liner notes impeccable , including authoritative 20 page history music performers . this project clearly conceived ideal follow up seminal 2 cd set " gospel sound " produced columbia 30 odd years ago heilbut legendary john hammond . there no overlap all two collections - they focus primarily different artists , where same artists appear ( mahalia jackson , dorothy love coates , dixie hummingbirds ) different ( equally powerful ) songs used . you'll want columbia collection well , since one cd covers pre-1947 roots , including unbelievable precision harmonies golden gate jubilee singers 3 tracks , second cd rivals this coverage period wwii 1960 . after these 2 albums you might check out heilbut other gospel collections shanachie , " gospel women , vol 1 vol 2 " , " kings gospel highway " , " great men gospel , vol 1 " or dorn/friedlander collection " gospel music " or " jubilation , vol . 1 vol . 2 " .	1
this my favorite oakenfold release . it so original it music selection . awesome driving music	1
i discovered this bit late but what beauty , what voice !! all i say thank god annie lennox !	1
this live cd perfect every musical way . music so awsome i crap myself everytime i listen this cd . songs taken hatebreeder something wild(the guy who wrote other review doesnt know what hes talking because follow reaper wasnt even out when they this show toyko . great buy . its very expensive cd but its worth money . i wish i could gotten it cheaper but oh well .	1
i love this cd . first off , i must say , i love power pop , knack , cheap trick , shazam , deal , etc . etc . granted , music all listener personal taste ( you negative reviewers this cd obviously none , ha ha ) . but seriously , this may one all-around best pop cds written . ever . period . i am not even jellyfish fan nor i impressed presents author unknown mr. falkner . chalk it up maturity or just sheer genius , but this album bee knees . it just everything ... lyrics fascinating intelligent production , wow , production complete surprises pace-changes always interesting make you want go back hit " play " one more time . this one those cds you could get lost desert island it would just okay ( hmm , solar powered ipod maybe ? ) . more details : amazon.com review - dead accurate , it really hard add much else . few artists or works compare this cd because songs fairly unique quirky , beck kinda way , while remaining always happier lighter confident side pop . i suppose references owsley cheap trick appropriate , but songs this cd longer stand themselves works art unlike typical 2min30sec power pop song strokes or hives . there sounds cars , beach boys , heck , even elo . tunes here aren't glammy , but times there some queen type bravado underlying , but more spirit or swagger then actual production . but ahhhhh , production .... every note twist turn each song grander purpose only genius ever understand . we simple fans must just try try , course , appreciate .	1
this album all more . brothers johnson no joke.in pocket guitaramp ; bass haven't same since they arrived scene . i'll good you still fresh today . together quincy jones they help create some most important music over past 30 years . i wish they could get back together	1
rebirth album breathed new life into angra after personnel shuffles following fireworks album but temple shadows bit blow - not terms musical skill , but it just band embraced such silly half-baked ide base poor concept album around . so they really needed acquire some forward momentum this disc - third full length album ' new ' angra . large band pull their chestnuts out fire . everything this release shows some conviction purpose - band here sending forth reasonably well rounded collection songs very much established angra vein . no big surprises here all but me that just fine . where this album wins out over it predecessor consistency . album less highs lows . we get everything we expect such bunch songs address melodic hard rock , couple segue into melodic metal few mellower numbers . but mentioned , this album whole wins through consistency . alas , around since early 90 angra no longer sheen new band generate excitement so this album probably only going heard established fans . which pity , but thos fand who kept faith well pleased this collection songs . personal faves here would include voice commanding you ; so near , so far breaking ties . it good see varied writing credits here which show what band effort this album . it also lovely see these guys still coming up different influences their music - take so near so far it use sound signatures not usually heard rock genre . it not case back holy land where all sorts instruments thrown listener , but use varied ' world ' influences definitely give angra edge , making them more individual some indefinable way more likeable bunch . minor gripes would slight issue whole ' english second language ' thing - though lyrics advisor employed presumably his job try iron out some clunkiness lyrics . lyrical concerns come across touch more dour than we're used this usually upbeat mob . but don't worry'bout above negatives - fans love this it would darn good place start newcomer start their education into angra catalogue . hearty 4 stars	1
cd amazing !!! i always fan bread , ever since i high school . i never grew tired hearing their songs over over again . when i saw digitally remastered cd amazon.com, i so elated because i couldnt find any their cd stores . it even better , i played cd over over again . so , it worth givin 5 stars ...	1

phil collins written banal , stupid , unmemorable , often uneven score this disney dreck musical , tarzan . his lyrics not rhyme all . they often try , but not work . his music bland highly unmemorable . actor playing tarzan , josh strickland sounds like cher jenn gambatesse jane needs work her english accent . orchestrations sound incredibly synthesized . nothing acoustical , nothing brassy , nothing remotely good . ( poor work usually wonderful doug besterman ) . show itself far worse than this cd . costumes scenic production incredibly tacky lame looking . book highly cliched structured quite poorly . this cast album filled awful music awful show . if you wish hear unmemorable music , bad performers dreadful lyrics , buy this album . if not , please not . you won't regret it .	-1
yeah , so there lot late 70 80 influences . if frightens you , take stress pill relax like frankie . it good stuff , stuff made us press rewind when meant something . it deep ? no . it best album decade ? probably not . it most fun you'll slightly less than hour , many hours , kind you thought no one made anymore ? hell yeah , son . try not dance . i dare ya	1

while i am partial bands like lamb god demon hunter i admit first band turn me this breed heavy metal music chimaira . when i first heard `pass out existence ' i floored brazen brutality musical diversity this band possessed , here , their third studio effort they don't let up but instead turn up heat create yet fantastic album . brilliant savagery they pull through tracks like opener `nothing remains ' `comatose ' yet delicate manner they bring new depth light tracks like my personal favorite `salvation ' tragic closer `lazarus ' which deals suicide friend . musically they one more talented bands out there , lyrically they shine especially this album . any fan two bands i mentioned outset , chimaira pure adrenaline adrenaline junkie ... you know who you	1

if ever there m.c. potential rekindle rap " golden era " supastition man . 2years after his " 7years bad luck " debut he dropped this mini-album ( 7 new tracks , intro plus 2 previously released singles ) teaser leading up his 1st full length soulspazm " chain letters " . after brief intro , " boombox " explodes through speakers amazing illmind produced beat captures supa breath-taking flows brilliantly . both " fountain youth " , " i remember " " homecoming " very nostalgic , reminiscing good old days hiphop , his childhood , how it him before he made it how he reps his hometown . beautifullly jazz crafted beats back these joints perfect results . " soul searching " " if i knew " personal tales supa life his baby mother how people treated him before he made it now they basically kissing his ** . " nowhere run " just track him+his crew spit catch wreck over madwreck produced beat . cd ends withs 2 previously released tracks " step it up " " adrenaline " . 1st stripped back breakbeat horns snares coming in+out add nice touch while supa tears joint down fantastic wordplay . however real gem this release " adrenaline " , high energy track captures exactly what great hiphop really . excellent addition any hiphop fan collection . get this plus his other 2 cd " 7years bad luck " " chain letters " , you wont regret getting any them	1
origin symmetry finds muse firing all cylinders sparing no prisoners their pursuit alternative rock throne radiohead jumped after ok computer album . their influence glaring element muse nags bit listener ; but thankfully , muse songs back it up . each track powerful laced dramatic crescendos soar sky high ( singer/guitarist matt bellamy vibrato croon ) then come crashing back down all their thrilling glory . muse wastes little time cutting straight meat their songs ... hooks come early upfront very little time spent detours ( although live setting sees them going bit overboard keyboard intros ... but that okay ) . bass strong drums pound unstoppable pounce . guitars blazing strong no punches pulled . me , matt bellamy voice could make or break this band average listener . some people not appreciate his breathy voice drips melodrama every word some may simply roll their eyes when he starts hit those high notes float around jeff buckley range ... but i like ti i think it adds nice prog rock touch it all . muse stretches things out works wonders their pop songs . they not afraid take risks fact , they strong band who deserve listen	1

some us who fans good while now , it seems hard place these timeless songs 2006 , but really thinking it , it half way through year , i don't know single album more explosive , gentle , soulful all same time than this album . truly thing beauty proof excellence still exists popular rock roll . what hard believe band only got better through record company mishap . not only they undoubtedly more patient people , but band become much tighter , logan evolving into technical genius behind drums , gutiars becoming solid fabric sound behind ever distinctive crooning skip , while timshel keys crown entire band sound way makes this band delight see live , not only rock out their new record . if they come your town , not pass up chance hear them ! perhaps only few days after release this album too soon anticipate next one , but anyone who fan , ( you quickly become one if you aren't already ! ) hear this , best rock album 2006 , know only greatness awaits this wonderful group	1
best king good introduction most underrated band hard rock . this collection covers their six albums atlantic 1988 out silent planet through 1996 ear candy . many best-of compilations , most best songs here well few questionable ones . here breakdown what included each album some comments : out silent planet : " king " " goldilox " . i can't argue these selections they both best most popular songs album . gretchen goes nebraska : " summerland " " pleiades " . first all , i would recommend all newcomers buy gretchen goes nebraska first since this band their very best whole album plays like one long highlight . you can't argue these selections since they among most well known . it would nice if studio version " over my head " included but since live version woodstock ' 94 included , i can't complain . faith hope love : " it love " , " mr. wilson " . this where band went very poppy . " it love " their most well known track " mr. wilson " very good . i would replaced " mr. wilson " " we finding who we " but no big deal . king : " black flag " " lost germany " . although " black flag " album most popular song , i would placed " prisoner " or " chariot song " here first . " lost germany " awesome deserves here . dogman : " dogman " " cigarettes " . " dogman " great but i never big fan " cigarettes . " all great songs this album , i'd probably put " fool you " here . ear candy : " train " , " looking love " , " life going " . both " looking love " " life going " great songs deserve here . however , i would replaced " train " " mississippi moon " , which best song album . unreleased tracks , all three very cool " sally " " lover " both very melodic while " april showers " shows band their funkiest . they're not among their best work but they not typical throwaway new tracks you get best-of collections . stated earlier , while i would recommend newcomers pick up flawless gretchen goes nebraska first , best king good introduction awesome band most tunes included among their best work . if you like what you hear , check out all their other albums . there not bad one among them .	1

they swagger monterey 67 right place right time . i like 3 tracks this album ( their first best ) . i can't recommend it masses , i purchased this mainly historical purposes . you must listen jefferson airplane ( first 2 albums only ) , peanut butter conspiracy ( first 2 albums only ) , grateful dead ( skip first 2 ablums ) before you dig this deep lost nuggets	1
i am largely disappointed this album . some reviews i read hailed dj spooky attempt conjoin multpile genres his expirimental style , but me result incoherent bravado noise . only enjoyable tracks those featuring guests such kool kieth sir menelik , but spooky silly pseudo-intellectual music-science rationalizations his overly filtered effects , it sounds less like music more like someone fun mixing board	1
i knew i buy this cd . i 20 when force mds came scene ' 84 , their music soundtrack my young adulthood . listening their beautiful voices remind me how much i detest post 1990 music . this cd must anyone who wants hear what great harmonies sounded like back ' 80s	1

this 1998 album last mariah came out before she stopped just flirting went full-speed into hip-pop , starting 1999s " rainbow " going last year " emancipation mimi . " now , don't get me wrong , woman few good singles this new hip-pop era hers ' ; fact i like all 4 big singles " mimi . " however , new output pales next fantastic pop songs " #1s . " album shows how good she ... huge ground-breaking ballads like " love takes time " " hero , " makes-me-wan t-t o-cut-a-rug dance tracks like " emotions " " someday . " plus her specialty , fabulous mid-tempo gems like " always my baby " " dreamlover . " who could forget one most popular songs all time , " one sweet day " boyz ii men . single spent 16 freaking weeks #1 hot 100 , more than any other song ever ! plus , this album shows how good she when she just flirted hip-hop , 2 great cuts " fantasy " ( although not this tacky version odb , but original album version ) " honey . " there so many good songs missing didn't make #1 , so get " greatest hits " those . fact , just get " greatest hits " because it includes almost everything here plus good stuff like " can't let go " " make it happen " " without you " " anytime you need friend " aforementioned " fantasy " original version " butterfly . " i am disappointed because neither " #1s " or " greatest hits " " breakdown " bone-thugz it , one my faves mariah . i wish mariah would lose some " hip " gain back some " pop " so she could make music good this again . this disc good rb/pop gets .	1

mineral one pinnacle bands independent music history . i stumbled upon mineral immediately i started diving into new ( me ) brand music dubbed " emo " ( time , 1998 , it still meant something ) . i picked up copy " power failing " my freshmen hands , broke onto life changing album .

this some absolutely beautiful music mozart , sung wonderfully cecilia bartoli . i especially love two arias obbligato basset clarinet or basset-horn opera quot ; la clemenza di titoquot ; k621 . mozart already written great clarinet quintet k581 anton stadler , who invented bassett clarinet , extended lower range warmer tone than conventional clarinet . these played very nicely peter schmidl this cd . but highlight this disc taxing concert aria k505 , added delight obbligato piano part , played feeling andras schiff . it best both worlds : combining mozart exquisite piano writing , orchestra , his penning heavenly vocal lines . cecilia bartoli delivers all counts . this absolute must all serious mozart collectors	1
fat joe comes back 17 months after his last album his 7th solo released his own record label this time . i every one his albums since " don cartegena " those 5 , this his worst or 2nd worst one , but it still pretty good worth while . shorter than most his albums , only 12 songs , you get 4 ok other 7 good , one or two them real good , but no classic material songs here ( 1 close however ) . guests minimal , rapping 2 songs doing hook 2 others . production average , not good he usually . streetrunner grind music each 3 songs , scott storch dj khaled 2 songs each runners adn nu jerzey devil each track . his fans i'd recommend it but he much better work past . #1 - 8 #2 - 8.5 #3 - 7 ( f/ lil wayne) #4 - 6.5 #5 - 7.5 ( f/ game) #6 - 7 ( f/ h-mob) #7 - 8.5 ( f/ lil wayne) #8 - 8.5 ( nice beat) #9 - 9 ( tight beat) #10 - 8 #11 - 8.5 ( dedicated his mom) #12 - 9.5 ( tight beat -- deeper song best song here)joseph cartegena -- . 8/19/72 -- bronx , nycheck all my review	1
this cd spectacular . i bought it weeks after it came out never stopped listening it . music good , soulful rock one hellacious pure blues song knock you flat . focus music obviously hart voice lyrics . words intense , honest , heartfelt she sings them all like it last time . killer song me am i one . i bought cd after hearing this song radio . i almost drove off road , wondering ' who this!' am i one sexy sensuous never fails leave me breathless . i heard beth hart radio only once which i don't understand . no one i ever talked heard her which i don't understand . all talentless people recording cds daily basis , how beth hart not huge inexplicable	1
srv friends play up storm . herein arguably definitive recorded versions " cold shot " , " pride joy " " things i used " . horns really add warmth sound , but stevie ray front center . eric clapton said he awe stevie ray vaughan his flow ; way solos just poured out him , there some blazing examples this recording . yes , man great guitar play , absolute master form , but something rarely mentioned his singing emotive his playing . he great voice this night too	1

unicorn song their only song i ever heard when i very young . i don't suppose irish rovers exactly my " time period " , ( i'm 29 ) but i absolutely loved this cd . i bought it unicorn but found so many other wonderful songs . even after listening it just once , i knew it would become one my favorites . i really liked black velvet band , years may come years may go , orange green . my girls just love it , too . we cleaned house hour because it just made us feel so upbeat . i don't know if everyone enjoy it , but i certainly recommend giving it try .	1
this people who enjoy real music band not all artificial . this album avril . you hear music , instruments . there no immitation filler . when listening this you almost feel you watching live band . what people expect when she left came back ? she didn't reinvent herself into something she ain't . she raw core use real instruments . album good beat continues throughout cd . i agree boy friend more pop album but rest what avril always . i like certain songs album not so great others but give me album i enjoy every single there rare treat . but i applaud avril staying true herself . allowing us see growing up doesn't mean turn stuffy , whorish or dead . i rather see avril any day act out girlfriend school age then watching gwen lead biotch party high school when she her 30'ish . all fans avril true music fans who don't appreciate fake music this good album you	1
understand just how much time passed since this release , try imagine time when there only one live document fans grateful dead . today , literally dozens upon dozens shows available through normal commercial channels , hundreds shows traded among aficionados , it seems almost comical imagine there once time when this only `official ' live document grateful dead . well , you've got start someplace , right ? , said , this one heck collection . there hardly anybody who would argue grateful dead band best suited recording studio . although they manage eke out occasional masterpiece , most their studio work sounds either way too loopy , or way too antiseptic . grateful dead just not sensibility required assemble tracks meticulous , orderly fashion . especially early stage their career , they viewed recording studio means breaking rules creating aural havoc , incredibly varied results . freedom constraints byword , but this attitude conveyed itself much more effectively live environment . live shows actually brought sense normalcy equation , since experimentation limited what they could create using nothing but their instruments their imagination . live/dead conveys just how successful they this regard . " dark star " , first ( only ) track side one , linchpin spawned band reputation most intuitive band rock roll . song itself - meaning part actually pre-written - consists little more than odd little melody limps pace molasses . it could disaster . grateful dead instinctive creative enough recognize potential offered , though , they waste none it . music doesn't accompany melody so much it surrounds it , basking wealth possibility could alter direction any moment . world rock roll , musical interplay rarely this instinctive . rest album operates same plateau , but varying degrees . " turn your lovelight " almost interesting , but operates more conventional base up-tempo blues jam . " death don't no mercy " equally heartfelt , but slows things down where you could draw breath each beat . " st. stephen " " eleven " most fun tracks listen , since they accurately capture playful , creative spirit made this band reputation what it . if you like your music succinct , cut , dried neatly arranged , this not album you . however , there hundreds thousands people who think outside box , music fans mindset already know anything i might say music grateful dead . you only listen , what better place start than beginning ? tom rya	1
i just picked this album up today i blown away . first all , despite mono recording , sound awesome ; clarity depth excellent . i shied away previous mono recordings , they tend get muddied , but this music suffers no such fate . kenny dorham sounds good i've ever heard him , bobby timmons just beginning shine . if you fan classic jazz , this must-have your collection	1
ok . rascals great . one best 60s groups ( but then what 60s group bad !? ) . this cd , compiled rhino - who saving good music ( endangered white rhino ) releasing great compilations 60s rock roll soul stars such this - great purchase , features many hits , some early single tracks , rascals . now , gripe little . some reviewers said sound quality this disc isnt very good . that crap . people say get me angry beyond belief . sound quality would need really , really , really crappy me say its bad . i one think old music should sound old , remaster it sure , but i think people complain too much poor sound remastering . part what makes this 60s music great , fact its 60s . age naturally going heard recording , which part sound songs should . its way they created . me , if you dislike sound , you dislike music . it age what i love ( partly ) . besides , mastering good anyway . disregard other reviewers , who should obviously listening modern music , " good sound quality " , who dont realize remastering only so much songs recoreded older technology . these people got free ... their annoying idiocy lolthis cd must .	1
this album includes group soothing songs consolidate certain musical instruments encapsulate virtually perfect jazz album .

" window soul " soulful rhythmic composition drum work wolfgang haffner , brian dunne josh dion , acoustic bass play christian diener , keyboard work loeb percussion play dion track muses different types instruments into one harmonious exposition . " starting over " skillful piano play king , more keyboard fender rhodes work loeb , ricchiuti king track marginally modified vibe than others . chuck loeb " presence " definitely its own charisma its own brand magnetism . enjoy !	1
i played this cd time i bought it 1989 until i bought debravation 1993 ( every day never got bored once ) . cd features best work debbie solo wise ( also so debravation ) but this collection hits back it up . okay not us but they hits . first time this issued 1989 there lp version less songs , cassette 2 more songs cd full 4 songs bonus put lp didn't . hits this cd " i want man " which number 2 modern rock charts ( held out ian mccullogh " faith healing " ) number 13 uk number 2 australian charts . " kiss it better " only issued promo track college radio where it reached number 12 " sweet low " which issued 2 times 12 " single going number 17 club play charts 1990 . two other singles " brite side " " maybe sure " . if you debbie freak like me then you probably own picture discs , 12 " singles 45 these singles uk where debbie harry considered queen she . if you don't any picture discs this album then look ebay because they worth it . now onto cd itself . what said this collection -- listen " lovelight " which melds debbie ian astbury cult quite well . punk " comic books " , " bike boy " thrash metal " forced live " . spanish/latin beauty " calmarie " , fun " bugeye " , rap/dance " get your way " what i consider best vocal debbie put record -- " i'll never fall love " - she just glows . plus you get what i consider most personal song debbie harry chris stein ever wrote -- " end run " break up their long union basically fall original punk rock scene . song very very deep . so besides hits songs listed you also get great cover art fact this only cd any work songs produced debbie harry herself . cd originally reached only 123 here us but got number 12 uk well throughout europe australia speaks well foreign markets than it us or warner squat this excellent collection . i so many copies def , dumb blonde they all well worth buying again again . a+++++++	1
this album not worth it . i took my time listened all songs it , they just weren't all good . music strange , not all catchy . tunes not popular . i would say ian van dahl much better artist this kind music , not lasgo	-1
after seeing these guys live few times during glory days , i lot respect them . this album killer . every track rocks . those you who haven't seen movie , go check out clay pigeons , which features " timebomb " opening track . soundtrack tons other awesome alt/country/punk music it . i recommend too far care anyone who likes cmt country radio ..	1
this album one first solo records jazz . , fact it early product chicago scene , which most famously included art ensemble , make it historic recording . this not music just anyone , but if you into avant-garde , it forbidding beauty only enhanced knowing it conceived executed 1969 ! braxton opens 9-minute tour de force dedicated john cage which sounds somewhat like cross coltrane 1961 quot ; chasin ' tranequot ; 90s evan parker solo . close listening required quot ;d edicated ann peter allen , quot ; which played barely audible level . this exemplifies one braxton core concerns -- experimentation pure sound well form . unfortunately , there one such experiment i judge failure , original side 4 , quot ;d edicated leroy jenkins . quot ; braxton , this 20-minute piece , repeatedly , deliberately , honks , ayler-style , interrupted brief forays into higher registers . i'm sure his mind this represented some sort formal exploration context quot ; honk , quot ; noble sax tradition going back earliest days jazz . however , not all such formal experimentation worthy , end , presenting public . my recommendation this -- listen quot ; altoquot ; side side . rather than trying digest it whole , listen each original lp sides separately , which physiologically more closely corresponds human attention span than 70-minute cd . if you open-minded , i think you hear beauty this great late-60s record	1
me personally i don't like it but movie pretty good . my husband likes cd	1
sad songs this " psychotherapy soundtrack " perfectly reflect my sadness purchased this cd -- even though i got it free borders !! instrumentals often given bad rep because some them ( bad ones ) merely pop compositions vocals removed , leaving just boring repetitive accompaniment . what mogwai sounds like . even worse , every song slow ballad but long rhapsody . it true -- mogwai even slower than tortoise ! musical arrangements follows : 1 ) establish baseline ; 2 ) make slight deviation norm ; 3 ) repeat several measures ; 4 ) rinse repeat . it doesn't like this ! m83 trs-80 post-modern instrumental bands , but they're not boring . mogwai boring . that bottom line .	-1

after creating one finest albums 90s almost perfect tour-de-force emotional grunge - 1992 " dirt " - one most touching eps i've ever heard - 1994 " jar flies " - aic final output before staley death this self-titled album , aka " tripod " . " tripod " never really got acclaim akin " dirt " , although certain tracks got deal airtime such dingy heaven beside you , it rather underrated grunge era . however , i feel it lack consistency " dirt " times feels little bloated , but then it also contains some aic finest work very unique eerie feel it , it final works before tragedy . opening two tracks kick things off typical aic grunge style . grind menacing sluggish riff combined infectious chorus melody , trademark aic their best , brush away probably my favorite more straightforward rockers album its stellar guitar interplaying cantrell staley desperate cries `i gotta get away ... brush away loose ground ' . vibes anguish depression continued multiplied tenfold punishing sludge factory , which feels like , well ... sludge . this pinnacle album , definitely up there aic best achievements . band bludgeon their way through 7 minute entirety huge walls down-tuned guitars one staley best ever performances , his delivery full such deep frustration anguish it genuinely touching . heaven beside you then adds different angle depressive gloomy atmosphere , replacing crushing chords delicate acoustic playing ( yes , odd strum power chord , naturally ) rather desolate detached vocal performance cantrell staley , both adopting almost `laid back ' style which works very well . after this break booming guitars , albeit very emotional intense break , head creeps opens bang , big guitars distorted vocals layne , fantastic opening . rest album not quite heavy , exception god am so close , both solid rockers , tracks such shame you , frogs over now slower stripped powerful guitars . shame you first sign `happy ' vibe , although it quite open interpretation , it could either taken rare glimpse sunshine or desolate , `given up ' type ballad . two closing tracks , which band also use close out " unplugged " session both very touching hold eerie feeling i mentioned earlier - feeling tragedy followed album . overall this fine piece 90s grunge music , portraying band while not their peak , still create some fine music vocalist like layne staley , there heavy emotional aspect , emphasised his death which followed album .	1
this box makes great listening its own , but if you directly compare it hitsville usa box mono masters , differences quite dramatic . stereo sound softer , smoother more colorful , but mono tracks punch intensity stereo tracks only occasionally match . i don't think anything botched here- stereo mixes ( where unaltered ) very similar my lp box stereo motown hits- it simply best their equipment could back then . some remixes appear genuine effort match organic power mono tracks , results fascinating . but i'd say hitsville usa it where it matters- it swings harder , more authentic , costs less . get over mono-phobia- hitsville usa mandatory purchase .	1
pete yorn brillant artist . musicforthemorningafter quite wonderful album listen begining end without skipping through songs . guitar so rich warm , followed yorn fantastic voice , making great combonation . if you want take first listen see what it all check out first album definately !	1
fresh his well-received score latest bond epic , " casino royale , " david arnold turned far more somber serious project michael apted important film beginning end slavery british empire , " amazing grace . " this not first time arnold worked apted , note bond effort " world not enough , " so we expected two rather comfortable one . good match it proven this time around . arnold produced score serious subject matter . it intelligent , moving times quite poignant . one might expected arnold simply integrate well known hymn which naturally plays role story number variations it ( much like his integration bond theme into his 007 music ) , but instead he created his own themes , including especially haunting main theme , fine score . arnold proven himself action-adventure genres we waiting more mature score , tasted bits pieces host other works . here we see david arnold capable composer across spectrum . well produced emi , soundtrack somewhat disappointing its packaging ; promotion " amazing change " appropriate deserving mention , but more could film music themselves . promo " music inspired film " bit much though given none it actually film .	1
while many today country ( matter , every other genre ) performers crank out " hits " packages one or two number one tunes , reba mcentire put out this disc slim ten tunes . said , however , all ten these songs legitimate hits . " rumor it " " you lie , " mcentire well song selection here . what you get small sampling ten reba best tunes . many today artists struggle find enough " hits " compile hits package , but reba around long enough simply pull few tunes her catalogue make solid hits album worthy purchase . she small group artists who such things . other names list would include george jones , willie nelson , george strait , merle haggard , alabama , dolly parton . that good company folks . my personal favorite this disc " fancy . " entire disc gives listener chance listen mcentire when she beginning loosen her country bindings feel out other styles music blues broadway . mcentire savvy , doesn't need resort controversy or pandering prove just how great artist she . purchase this album if you want some great country pop country tunes . long before faith tim considered " dynamic duo " dixie chicks singing western swing birthday parties , mcentire establishing herself one greatest female performers country music . also note fact she made her mark when country genre dominated men . highly recommended	1

second record texan noise-makers . it filled short quot ; tunesquot ; , or rather pieces , built mostly around guitar , bass drums . but they perform their music cross amateurish playfulness artistic conceptuality . not they bad musicians , but they understood charm simplicity lo-fi bands nineties use great effect . this record deserves better recognition important art-rock/alternative influence	1

i've big bsb fan since 1999 all their import albums bonus tracks . i think this album their worst , but still good . my biggest complaint this album lack darren hayes penned track lift me up , they said interviews not up par rest album i could not disagree more . boys didn't hardly anything writing this album , which not my complaint , but darren hayes track could over powered almost any track entire album . i darren hayes version bsb version they both stellar . bsb awesome job track which hard me say because i am darren hayes fanatic i wonder what they thinking when they left this track release didn't even include it b-side . anyway , never gone solid album , just pissed they didn't include darren hayes track because it eclipses most songs album . solid return something new . good album , just could slightly better . too bad us fans , we get no bonus tracks unless we buy import version album which always better than us release . record companys give us worst version any album no matter what artist . compare any import album any us release you find us release stripped comparison .	1

suzi quatro great introduction rock roll when my early teens 70 th`s here intense female light screaming vocal exploded my ears . that`s fore sure . there`s no playlist listed here this import , but i first print 1990 , stumblin not included among these 20 greatest hits , but maybe emi included it 2005 print . but there more enough goodie , goodies cd . it smashes directly into here megahitcan , masterpiece songwriters chinn/chapman . suzi " rock roll " scream queen , which plays bassguitar , heartbeat driven rythmic punch bass which realy set`s standard . track 2 48 crash also delivers much same quality previous one . suzi voice raw scream quality , fits perfect this early 70 ths hit . track 3 daytona demon , weird breathing vocal beginning , but doesn`t holds same standard . too much , too messy . other words , " not demonic " give me good creepy feeling . track 4 devil gate drive . we back simpel good rock roll feeling . this one knows it roots , its very well performed every department . track 5 too big , minor let down . it drive , thats sure , but little extra missing . great pianoplaying background , though . track 6 wild one , not wild enough , nothing other great songs same title . this orginal chinn/ chapmann production . track 7 you mamma won`t like me . just ok this one , funky it anyway , sometimes good , sometimes not . track 8 i bit off more than i could chew . it`s suzi doin " psychidelia " rock roll change . not everybody taste . track 9 i may young " honky tonky " rock roller which swings ok . track 10 tear me apart , quality rock roller , good singin melody follow . track 11 roxy roller , ecco , good bassdrive , but melody which easily forgotten . track 12 if you can`t give me love chinn/ chapman classic which realy delivers . it drive , guts , glory , much soundpicture stumblin classic smokie sound , where chris norman came who sang duet suzi stumblin . track 13 race something else change . it begin`s ballad , but suddenly changes weird rythmic pop song , which far rock roll . track 14 she`s love you , song which refrain which goes , that`s it . track 15 mamas boy , much same problem . track 16 i`ve never love good standard rocker heart soul roots back 50 ths . track 17 rolling stone , here first singel 1972 , ecco flower power music , but sorry say not good . track 18 all shock up , interesting take presley classic , it swing`s very well all trough . track 19 keep knockin , classical rock roller , where suzi gives us orginal interpretation off . track 20 wake up little suzi . classic which everly brothers ricky nelson better . anyway , this glam , bam , quality rock roll suzi quatro , good introduction quality rock roll " scream queen " 70 ths . if stumblin included this 2005 print , you extra gem , lucky you	1
im only 15 white kid but i think i know good music when i hear it , stanley clarkes school days my all time favorite jazz album , bass playing blew me through puberty other musicians all jazz legends . this truly amazing album	1
well start i thought this going good album . sadly i mistaken . i usually don't make bad choices because i always screen my music before buying . this time i didn't which mistake . it started out good but after hitting 4th or 5th track they all seemed sound same nothing impressed me anymore . it just seems if band stopped trying after first 4 songs . don't get me wrong there couple tracks i really like lot . it just many tracks nothing me sound same . here my ratings ... 1 . dopesick - 10/102 . beginning end - 9/10 3 . return zero - 9/104 . glass jaw - 8/105 . deep colors bleed - 7/10 6 . mailbomb - 7/107 . bedsores - 4/108 . slowburn - 3/109 . somewhere - 6/10 10 . lesser god - 2/1011 . pitch black - 4/1012 . if only - 7/1013 . thick skin - 3/10overall : 60% d-this cd just got so boring just wasn't good . i don't know maybe it right you . i am warning you though your research before hand otherwise you could end up like me .	1
gran edicion que reune las obras de los animals bajo la perspectiva de su productor . temas iniciales , todavia enfrascados en el rb primigenio , mucho bob didley demas .... encontramos la version definitiva de house rising sun .. que mas decir ...... booklet modesto , sonido acorde los a�os de las grabaciones . documento de una epoca .......	1
well , i probably enjoy this cd once i get it . i ordered it july 7th ! it now august 30th ! amazon always great fullfilling my order promptly -- i receiving my order ???? good question ! louanne miller xandlmiller@yahoo.com	1
insomnium one best melodic death bands i've come across quite some time . quite some time indeed . these guys set great atmosphere their melodies , great guitar harmonies melodies . get it so	1
i completely blown away when i received this cd , it best thing i ever bought so little money . when i get cds , i skip through songs get few i actually really enjoy ... i didn't skip through any songs this cd once ! this honestly really great buy ... if you can't decide whether or not buy it- buy it , you won't sorry	1
i can't get over how awesome tom waits . i think he my generation neil diamond . he writes songs things i don't understand all . i listening opening track off this gem understood song war bolivia over collard greens . i'm not sure if what song really , but his delivery so silky smooth you really don't care . he reminds lot josh groban his voice . it very smooth pleasing . i date supermodel iowa last week put this disc . she got little mad because she thought she going get some love because i put mood music . i told her her love delivered later , but just quiet listen vocal stylings next bryan ferry . weights one those artists it not cool like , kind like telling people you love mtv now . i'm not all ashamed admit i like tom weights more than chris deburgh this point . he still not josh groban or peter cincinnati , but he certainly won't make you puke when you listen him . get this cd because tom neato	1
this music so good it makes you stop what you're doing so you start playing air guitar sing ! johnny rivers ' music not what you need play when multitasking . you'll never get your work . start here introduction his recordings , then start collecting original albums . rivers one few artists whose ' filler ' material just good ' hits .	1
this far one hancock best recordings ( least since headhunters , thrust , manchild days ) . he captures strange haunting sound twilight jazz , pop rock . when i come home long day there nothing better than mixing gin tonic putting herbie fantastic version " norwegian wood " . musicians seams completely tune this record , not just showing off talent but really putting there soul into it . if you dig miles davis " silent way " or coltrane " my favorite things " then you going love this fantastic record . tracks like " mercy street " , " when i see you " , " manhattan " " love stronger than pride " made good stuff , they played depth skill rare way makes classic . short this record put next any great jazz masterpiece	1
this seems older group his earlier recordings . i love ' my world ' .. il mondo . i know this song spanish it so beautifully engelbert english . all songs chosen this cd really nice listen . if my cd broken or damaged i'd certainly buy replacement this same one again	1
me ice-t one best rappers ever i've spent long hours listening his hardcore gangster rap . kind odd middle-aged white guy but what i say ? his your face , pro-freedom speech attitude one i hold myself . he one founding fathers gangster rap one it most innovative lyricists . i've seen ice-t his rap act only once but seen him his band body count four times he puts tremendous show . seven deadly sins lot more edge it than ice-t preceding album , return real . result it better effort some solid tunes . there not much mix beats though , which weakness , but you play it through without skipping quite entertained . seven deadly sins scores solid 3 stars : retaliation * common sense * check your game* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ratings : cds rated simply how many good songs album . great songs get two stars , good songs get one star . songs get no stars those i might like but not enough give it star or ones i find boring or actively dislike . cds not penalized songs i don't like because they easy enough skip over . there no maximum number stars cd get , but course more stars it gets , better cd . all reviews , these my subjective opinions album .	1
i fan leon russell since he band high school - i records but needed cd	1
i am so dissapointed this cd . i bought it because i " blow blow " " jeff beck jan hammer group " i love those cds . this crap sounds like somebody heard those recordings , practiced one week tried imitation them . i don't like one cut entire cd . i only gave it one star because i couldn't find way give it less .	-1
i love this cd . sheila . one best , if not best , drummers around today . her remake lady marmalade outstanding . she really turns up funk droppin like flies , funky attitude heaven . this must any sheila . fan	1
here fine collection songs you not find anywhere else ; good price . i admit i'm not big fan ferlin husky voice ( i find it too " whiney " ) , but his biggest hits included here , sound excellent . included this album his signature songs " wings dove " " once " ; well fair rendition don gibson " i cant stop loving you " .	1
this collection , rock instrumental 50 classic great addition any collection , you don't hear these recordings hardly all . availability these cd very good thing , get all these hits together excellant price extremely hard find . all these songs original course , rhino , counted real stuff . this cd should given 10 stars .	1
this one best collections any band ever compiled ! comes classics keith gregg ginn put , black flag map ! you just can't go wrong quick yet catchy songs just stay your head all day long . fix me wasted quick blur that how punk songs should . not some sort opera rock goes nine half minutes long ... six pack always funny song sing . " what we gonna !?! t.v. broken !!! oh no we're gonna miss our favorite shows !! " " my girlfriend asked me which i liked better i hope she doesn't leave me " it kinda two one album when you listen it because both vocalist brought their own style band . find out what fuss over this band pick up classic comp !	1
exquisite only way describe these young boys voices . selections arrangements beginning end unique , so beautifully other-worldly quality them . put aside everything while you listen , you'll think you're not far heaven . we lost bring tears your eyes abide me far most moving version i ever heard . words all included booklet . buy this one , you'll keep it forever	1
this not cd one or two great tunes ; it entire album . i echo other reviewers each song it unique aura so you don't listen same techniques orchestrations each track . this album serves my benchmark compare all other guitar artists ' works	1
chet baker still such much loved trumpeter days past his seamless skillfulness concerning ballad . this 1959 recording riverside comes baker peak years , fresh backed all-star sidemen day . this one most breathtaking jazz albums i own my collection , because i always count chet set mood . there something chet delivery so lonesome sad , but same time so uplifting invigorating . considering myself diehard fan , i've always preferred his trumpeting his singing . this album you treated nothing but trumpet , which happens my favorite instrument , also . good yourself buy this album soon possible ! it immediately become one handful albums life finally says something you , without uttering single word . one only bill evans , genius jazz pianist / composer , sat baker album . paul chambers also present ; probably hardest working bassist business his day , flutist herbie mann plays these tracks , also . guitarist kenny burrell , baritone saxophonist pepper adams , drummers philly joe jones connie kay also back chet up these ballads .	1
i love bosa nova brazilian music discovered it many business trip rio . this disk like brazilian muzak . no soul it my opinion	-1
man oh man , this one fine rock roll album . i bought it 1995 when i 14 years old its still one my favorite records ever . i dont like hype things too much fear people disappointed but if someone doesnt like this then we nothing common when it comes music . misery song among songs what made me fan first place . promises broken i my best grade country rockers . i cant think bad thing say this album or this band , cant wait hear what they put out next	1
i now all three carter family cd they great	1
this cd very pretty but i loved some their other cds lot better . this cd little more adult sounding not all electronic some their previous work . not dancy but never less good cd	1
trane cherry perfect foil each other . far this type music goes , this one best albums . this much like coleman album coltrane sitting . musical interplay " blessing " outstanding . it interesting hear coltranes soprano sax here , first time he played it album i believe . this very important album history jazz , it wort getting fact alone . some my friends who not like jazz , especially this type , actually like this album . if you want explore music john coltrane don cherry individual artists there some better choices though . like most music coltrane involved he makes very bold musical statement . also nice version " bemsha swing "	1
it some songs i am looking but i am looking jingle bells , guy lombardo royal canidians . alubm fifties . i album but would like it cd	1
honest , i didn't like this cd much first . it really grew me , though , all i've listened last three days . true , it leap outside realm what you'd expect esl thievery corporation . not bad thing - who wants never surprised ? it not nearly ... happy i expected it though , reading others reviews . it definitely funky , but sort dark vibe it , too . it rocks . buy it . absorb it	1
that how describe this . album . era where lowest common denominator junk gets played radio , anyone review any piece garbage amazon , giving it 4 or 5 stars when it deserves 1 or 2 , this great change . granted it some 30 years old , but it still relevant today it when it released , which just one great things it . this definition album which sum greater than parts . thankfully , far greater . individual songs , 2 chord deals doesn't work out real well . they seem boring , repetitive , etc . however , when you listen it start finish , they flow together , blow you away . start finish , you feel revitalised , like you just learned new life lesson , maybe end , it truly feeling counts , essence great music	1
these widely considered finest recorded performances one premier baritone popular singers ever . it shame dick haymes not opportunity follow these recordings even more . statement other review haymes voice " ragged " little bizarre , because most anyone listening would describe these performances ( i hate use word ) " smooth " . these recordings only available high priced alternative editions japan rare out-of-print english edition . but this edition adds bonus all haymes various singles capitol ( never cd before , all very rare any form ) . if you enjoy haymes , sinatra closest competitor , please try out many various cds put out dick haymes society , all available through amazon , live radio performances , studio transcriptions other things , all good quality discs rare collectables someday . this 2 cd edition very special . if you like sinatra ballad records 50 capitol , get this too !	1
when i first listened " bless martyr , kiss child " , eloquent makeup brutally efficient hardcore norma jean , i never thought they could make album could come close matching shear superiority album . i wrong , i'll tell you why ; not because " o ' god ... " necessarily matches up , but because two literally uncomparable . when josh ( lead vocalist ) left band , he also left traditional sound made norma jean special well , brought it his newest project , chariot . then , after brief vocal hiatus , cory joined band lead vocalist , he , like josh , brought innovative sound him . so comes brilliantly simple but never outdated cliche , every death there rebirth . further prove my mondane use this cliche , norma jean " reborn " , they proved it their sophomore album " o ' god ... " album itself , priceless commodity artistic sound , brings such energy , vigor , individuality world hardcore music lacks today . album hits hard immediately #1 " murderotica " , passionate , short sweet ( 1:58 ) collection bliss . cory yells " our knives say ' we're making way this , ending '" , it takes lot not jump out your chair start beating up air vivaciously . #3 " bayonetwork " single album , one only three songs cd actual singing vocals it . rough melody cory sings " this me this blade my heart " . guitars , heavy crunch tuning called " minor " which unheard many , but makes sound guitars much more different other hardcore acts . best song album #8 " absentimental " , comprised use fast paced metal mixed traditional use breakdown previously demonstrated " bless martyr , kiss child " . i listen this song whenever i either need get pumped up day , or i'm really pissed off something ; it therapy i promise , try it . i recommend this album anyone who smart enough know what pure art , because that what " o ' god aftermath " , pure art . lyrically superior , heavy sumo wrestler , brilliantly passionate , blissfully heartfelt their intentions ; norma jean not go wrong when they made this album . they become inspiration me many others , displaying belief something beyond ourselves not prevent us writing heavy music . so go , buy this album , blast it max , live dream ..	1
i love this cd , i think it one best bluegrass collections bela produced , host different styles artists	1
i never fortunate enough see cale live , so i treasure this . every song completely different original , so it like two discs adventurous brand new music . one question though : i heard least two comments people great sound quality . mine , however , sounds like medium-quality bootleg , hugely disappointing . anyone know if there multiple versions this	1
man midwest introduced me david allen coes music . i am glad he . after i got this album played it all my family friends i think all them liked it much i . anyway if you care anything outlaw , renegade style country music then this definately must cd ! it remind me hank jr ., willie nelson , waylon jennings certain extent . too bad you not hear sample quot ; ridequot ; song . probably song most people remember david allen coe . song also puts me mind alan jacksons quot ; midnight montgomeryquot ; song ( similiar subject )	1
i really love this cd my yoga classes . disc 1 escalates nice pace beautiful flow practice disc 2 wonderful cooling phase meditation . all artists favorites mine , especially deva premal .	1
lift every voice one lloyd most mature albums date . it amazingly spiritual soulful time when it most needed . highly recommended	1
i've fan coltrane while now , slowly building up my library , i warned wild later period so i began his early stuff continued way . i remember first time i listened love supreme , i speechless , it blew my mind ! then i listened live birdland , when coltrane came his solo afro blue i thought my heart gonna stop ! ahh . so once i listened quartet albums thousandth time , i decided it time go forward . some reason i picked live seattle my step into coltrane later formed world , i think it because i loved birdland so much i jumped live album . when i first listened , i couldnt get through cosmos , though i liked out this world some parts others songs . so trouble album i didnt listen it while . though i didnt go out buy more albums right away , i started reading knowing much coltrane i could . musician , hes always one my musical idols , but then he became idol its own , i truely admired him all he worth , there no like him ! i started listened sun ship i dug it so i decided try out live seattle once again , when cosmos began , i felt like i falling into trance . i closed my eyes my body swayed back forth , i felt music deeply my heart soul , when i got body soul i tears my eyes . i love john coltrane	1
not quite classic , but highly superior album . milk rhyme just well he makes beats , which fire ! dilla-esque approach tempo songs , milk delivers piece sv ( w/ dilla ) era nostalgia . plus w/ detroit legends like elzhi , phat kat , others ... black milk drops gem hip-hop heads .	1
i fervently hope norah jones not turn out one hit wonder . there just so little excited music today . this music touch you , unlike commercial kaka predominates	1
possible exception track 12 - sick punk ( already recorded cd ) , this cd nothing but tripe ! this cd full painful ballads horrible lyrics deserves negative rating if possible . i also considered nuno one best ( if not best ) guitarists world ... but after this his previous solo effort(s ) ( he dressed girl cover one cd ) , not mention mourning widows , he really lost whatever magic he once commanded . sadly , least jason becker good reason his fade . he set aside all made him great - playing guitar . far other raters go - stop lying public ! nuno one greatest guitarists , but nuno seems dead . don't buy this cd without first hearing samples abysmal tracks first . buyer beware !!	-1
there always something hokey steppenwolf . their coolness contrived , i don't think anyone my neighborhood took them too seriously . comparing steppenwolf let say jefferson airplane would like comparing monkees beatles . but steppenwolf live album they acheived something little bit above their usual guilty pleasure status . yeah , it not true live album , blah , blah , blah , but whatever applause tracks they added later doesn't interfere ( too much anyway ) good cuts . i mean lot people bought got live if you want it stones . there several fake live albums those days . but there some good cuts here . tighten up your wig , draft resister , power play , twisted , here there eventually yes , monster version monster . all these my ears sound much better than their big hits end disc , magic carpet ride , pusher born wild . get original studio version one their dozens greatest hits packages hear hits . lyrics , well they what you could call blue collar activist or radical 60 dummies . however i say if you look words monster latter half suite , you might think it 2006 ... " though ( america ) past its share injustice/kind spirit many way/ but its protectors friends sleeping/now it monster not obey . " all together now " ... their vote meaningless joke . they babble law orderbut it all just echo what they've told . yeah , there monster looseit got our heads into nooseand it just sits there watching . now we fighting war over therethat no matter who winsyou know we can't pay costamerica , where you now , don't you care your sons daughters ? don't you know we need you now , we can't fight alone against monster ? " kids ( anyone 25 or younger ) band considered ok time . if you haven't heard this version monster , that worth price admission alone . if you think 60 music only getting high getting laid , think again . lot lyrics not only timely , they prophetic same time	1
i am very happy cd any tina turner fan	1
i am just normal middle aged guy doesn't typically reveal my " sensitive " side . however , i popped this broadway recording cd player saturday morning almost fell apart . brian stokes mitchell , don quixote , masterful job drawing you into heart mind wandering , opportunistic knight errant . course classic always , " impossible dream ( quest ) " not justice unless turned up point stokes mitchell vocals cause pictures wall tilt ! knowing story don quixote sancho panza leads one laugh hysterically " golden helmet mambrino " . you can't listen this piece without chuckle . lastly , final sequence mary elizabeth mastrantonio aldonza proclaiming herself dulcinea acknowledging her love quixote , don quixote cry his armour , reprise " quest " overlaid " psalm " just extraordinarily incredible finish . my listening eye pictured great last gasp inspired hope don quixote challeges cast never give up quest . likewise , massed vocals crescendo embue listener always , dream impossible dream ! yourself favor , buy this cd . listen it loud . listen it long listen it over over again . you won't regret experience	1
i truly appreciate rhino records re-released remastered alice cooper " billion dollar babies " " welcome my nightmare " which included bonus tracks more . rhino 4 cd box set rather disappointment because they chopped up or only gave us " single " versions many his tracks . so when i saw " welcome my nightmare " come out re-released remastered rhino , i hoping rhino would re-release remaster alice cooper entire catalog . least , rhino should consider remastering alice cooper " love it death " , " killer " , " school out " . " love it death " , " killer " really need some extra attention . first only issues these two albums warner brothers just sound weak , muddy hissy , just simply old-world mastering technology . " i'm eighteen " sounds alot better rhino " best alice cooper " cd . check it out yourself . come rhino , please finish what you started .	1
this might not very first gangsta rap album , but rage ice cube voice premium production dr. dre this album set stage mainstream gangsta rap even without help radio or mtv . acronym niggaz attitude these guys packed all attitude compton into this disc . mc ren ice cube spitting your face street lyrics like p***ed off chuck anyone who heard this couldn't dodge impact subject matter . " *** police " , which course warranted imfamous letter f.b.i. , dose shocking realism time rest album . eazy adds flavor flav quasi-comic relief making this all around entertaining album . dj yella assists dre beats coming together bomb squad hardcore sonic influences adding some west coast flavor them . noted beginning this review n.w.a. not first gangsta rappers , but often case music it ones who perfect genre get recognition rather than innovators . perfect gangsta rap exactly what n.w.a. straight outta compton	1
i knew leo kottke my high school days back late 70s early 80s when i buying lps chrysalis label artists like blondie ufo . record sleeves always pictures other artists ' releases i remembered kottke his unusual name because i wondered why anyone would want album guitar no vocals or drums . well , i'm older now , i've finally heard my first kottke disc , it very easy see how man built 30+ year career acoustic guitar music . pieces this album beautifully played -- clear lovely occasional touches humor . recommended	1
songs this pretty cool enjoyable , but where " bang bang rock ' roll " ? which played movie during part when ff learning live each other . i really loved song they didn't put it cd . that huge bummer . so because i give album only 4 stars instead 5	1

while mr. ho probably represents ultimate authentic hawaiian traditional singing , i can't say i really go kind rough , old-fashioned folk music , its macho depictions intertribal warfare patriarchal oppressiveness . call me wimp , but i much prefer softer smoother sounds early 1960s " lounge " music , all those cool daddy-o lyrics mellow instrumental accompaniment . you just can't beat something like les elgart or dick hyman soothing background your next full-tux cocktail party	1
i disagree positive reviewers completely . i am casual astrud listener who unfortunately bought based their reviews , let down . i just wanted astrud lovely voice simple accompaniment . what i got organ drowning out her voice . i since bought silver collection , which i think suit better most people wanting casual listening experience where emphasis truly her lovely , simple voice	1
this good starting anthology jgw . my only regret " real deal " inexplicably missing it . scat masterpiece . thing above viewer pointed out , jgw use humor his compositions . i mean , i just cry when i hear johnny vamp end " real mother ya " : " gimme some low lead , i ain't gonna fool nuthin ' else ! i gotta stop buying two hot dogs strawberry soda !

putumayo never gone wrong its brazilian compilations . like " brasileiro " , its first brazilian compilation , this album focused country acoustic music . this album reflective , relaxing , times bittersweet , like dark chocolate . highlights-1)aquele frevo axe-on this song , gal costa sounds like more famous bebel gilberto . it delightful song , despite its theme lost love . 2)samba triste-ana de hollanda sings lilting , melancholy song . her niece bebel gilberto . it unusually catchy " sad samba . " 3)ciranda-a bittersweet , powerful song memory . it also very hopeful . marcio faraco sings " if i want run , time stops/if i stop watch , world goes . " 4)meu monde hoje eu sou assim-this like cape verdean morna . 5)tem quem queira-this song sounds like brazilian version mariachi song . it almost if rita ribeiro linda ronstadt " canciones de mi padre . " very beautiful . rita ribeiro star brazil her powerful voice . caetano veloso , chico buarque monica salmaso also contribute thoughtful , delicate songs . this must any brazilian collection	1
roxy music career divided into two fairly distinct halves . mach i flamboyant early mid 70 version mixed experimentation unique rocking side . mach ii creamy dance band late 70 early eighties . while both bands their highlights , i definatley prefer early version . this cd documents band playing live their glory years . strong , but unusual selection songs enhanced strong performances . number these cuts eclipse already amazing studio versions . my favorites include both ends burning , if there something pyjamarama . bryan ferry obviously enjoying himself these performances rest band contibutes sublime moments throughout . fans early version this band , viva must . those fans later years may wish check this out before purchasing	1

i first discovered ub-40 1981 well before they reached their fame . this album far their best effort ever , before they became quot ; educatedquot ; music started all their cover versions other peoples songs . i remember introducing music ub-40 many , many people , this day , this album ranks among top 10 all time all us came early 80 cutting edge generation music	1
after highly succesfull " empire " album , queensryche forced tour extensively order meet demand their concerts . after long , greuling tour , band members went their seperate ways extended period time , eventually re-united record their fifth studio album titled " promised land " . phrase " promised land " actually metaphor american dream success . queensryche discovered ( commercial ) success , which what " empire " gave them , really wasn't all it made out . so they hit studio , instead writing futuristic totalitarian digital age ( found some songs " warning " " rage order " ) , or social commentary love songs ( case " operation : mindcrime " empire " ) , queensryche decided instead look within lyrics revolve around personal issues . end result " promised land " , which , say least , masterpiece . instrumentally , this queensryche creative peak . theres still " metal " parts found songs such " damaged " " my global mind " , but theres much more variety this time around , plenty clean guitars , guitar harmonies , guitar solos actually add songs without giving feeling they just there fill up space . however , this album few road bumps . " dis con nec ted " still continues same dark , moody atmosphere all songs leading up it , but it clearly inferior quality rest album . " my global mind " step-down quality well . however , they still descent songs fit well album . rest album nothing short exellent . my favorite songs " i am i " it eastern flavored guitar harmonies open up album positive note , fact my second favorite queensryche opener behind " walk shadows " , " bridge " , which nice , short , emotional song written chris degarmo which talks his torn relationship his father , title track , which really hard describe , " one more time " , it beutiful mix clean distorted guitars topped off great chorus almost gilmore-like guitar solo , " someone else " , which song jampacked emotion great singing . conclude , this album exellent , my second favorite ryche album behind " operation : mindcrime " . it might take some people couple listens album sink , but once it , it exellent . i highly recommend this album	1
kix made best pure rock roll record their careers blow my fuse . i don't understand why this album would excluded any fan hard rock or metal . song song album just smokes . smoker " red light , green light " just blasts wonderfully so ... i can't imagine anyone not instantly liking " cold blood " or " don't close your eyes " they memorable hooks . kix this point time better than acdc but never got recognition they deserved . this band very influenced sound but bon influence fun entertainment . steve excellent vocalist this genre if you don't know kix this their best effort overall nothing they after or previously came close . highly recommended listening	1
charles mingus ' 1956 release , pithecanthropus erectus , one his very first great albums . mingus recorded many great artists this point , including max roach , dizzy gillespie charlie parker . mingus also recorded few good albums early mid fifties . however , it pithecanthropus erectus got mingus noticed jazz world . this became first album string albums would some best most important albums era . although many these albums surpassed pithecanthropus erectus , this albums still remains essential charles mingus catalogue . title track incredible compositon attempts recreate dawn man music . it one his best compositions . foggy day very cluttered sound . i'm not sure if i like it or not , but i think it one weaker tracks album . profile jackie great song puts alto sax player jackie mclean spotlight . album ends love chant , which highlight . playing this album incredible it essential mingus fans . however , some his following albums would stronger compostions . this still must	1

this got one offspring best cds , next smash , ignition ! some songs like : " me my old lady " , " mota " , " cool hate " , " don't pick it up " , kind wierd , but other songs awesome ! some best include : " meaning life " , " gone away " , " i choose " , " amazed " , " all i want " , " change world " , just all other songs i didn't say weird . intro song awesome , because it spoken jello biafra - dead kennedys like one my favorite bands - so that huge plus ! i think this like more expiremental re-make smash , i'm just glad they didn't over it , they just it right . so anyways , if you're new offspring , you might wanna start smash , or ignition , so you get better taste their true sound . but if you already know who offspring - get this now	1
although venentian snares ' reputation one fastest ear bleeding electronic acts moment one he seems steer away some albums ( winter belly snake , rossz csillag allat szuletett ) , its reputation he wholeheartedly embraces winnipeg frozen sh*thole . this album recalls his noisy debut making orange things he made speedranch - loud , fast considerably less complex glitch/idm than his usual output ( but lot more complex than normal gabba/speedcore ) . said , i'd say winnipeg frozen sh*thole quite bit better than making orange things ( album i've only just grown enjoy gave rather scathing 1 star review 8 months ago ) due more cohesive sound , more attention beats rhythms much more intelligent use samples . music gabba driven breakcore . relentlessly fast never quiet moment , album one his most dancable ( providing dancers taste extreme ) . emotion isn't really name game here neither complexity ( there some ' wtf ? ' moments but compared lot his stuff winnipeg frozen sh*thole relatively straight-ahead ) . although not brain meltingly complex higgins ultra low track glue funk hits or experimental doll doll doll it makes up it very danceable catchy only way venetian knows how . if you want your next venetian snares album little more than gabba driven noisecore mentally unstable dance then pass this up time , but its great album so don't go too long without it	1
finally , blue note jackie mclean co . given time opportunity practice/rehearse/jam before tape started rolling . not disparage records like mcleans scene , strange blues , alto-madness etc ... they wonderful but all extremely loose seem tetter times not emotionally but what hell coming next kind way which beautiful ... its just new soil little preconceiving seems let things grow unhindered . donald byrd trumpet , paul chambers bass , walter davis jr. piano , pete la roca drums ... oak-solid band who swing out mcleans furrowed like phrases ... relentlessly . i highly recommend this music	1
yes , one earlier reviewer states it , black snake rules indeed ! this song kept sneaking back into my brain time again after i lost my tape quot ; hearing atomic roosterquot ; many years ago . when i bought cd , i recalled this just o 8 superb tracks . this cd competes best work elp which one somewhat reminded whenever piano dominates . but e.g. there great sax well . there isn't any dull moment this cd ! i keep wondering whether it really just three people ( excluded singer ) which produce such tight sound . bonus track quot;devil answerquot ; album atomic rooster which apparently big success . but it doesn't really measure up rest quot ; hearing ofquot ; , so i'm still doubt whether i should buy one	1
britney outdone herself this one . this ballad just so amazing . i listen it i drive down beach i can't get enough it . i think it one britney best . buy it ! you wont regret it .	1
i just got this cd concert , it every way awesome ! i am lead guitarist also particular who i listen . my opinion best g3 eric johnson whom i seen concert 3 times , once when he 17 years old , time he absolutely best guitarist i ever seen , ( i also met him we talked stratocasters how he modified his get those amazing tones , he real nice person ) opinion still stands . eric johnson still plays chords his songs , which i feel great guitarist , plus most technical tasteful leads . i don't think i heard joe satriani or steve vai play any chords all except 3 last cover tunes , now don't get me wrong , i think all 3 great ! i joe satriani albums also love them , but eric johnson vituoso good reason . i plan purchase dvd also . incidentally i worked some really hot lead guitarists who never play chord either , guess what ? i don't think they any idea what chords tune . why i appreciate virtuoso eric johnson , complete guitarist . i heard seen him play clapton , hendrix , almost any style flawlessly . i his " total electric guitar " vhs ,.... wow ,... i could never learn play so well ( i spent many hours trying ) . some people born spectacular-eric johnson . overall this wonderful live concert 3 great lead guitarists great backup musicians . i highly recommend it fans musicians alike .	1
this album wasnt good i hoping . its pretty strange whole album christina ricci , but content great , beats grouch nice . very good chill/kick back album	1
i'm not really fan any compilations ultra records put out anymore , least ultra chilled . i haven't really heard other compilations like ultra dance first ultra trance but judging track list , they pretty generic mixed cds . i bought ultra trance 2 whim . i fortunate enough find used copy opposed shelling out { money } new copy . i can't comment bonus dvd since i don't own dvd player so i comment first disc . my major problem disc 1 botched mixing job provided david waxman . songs so not flows well together . i think reason songs david waxman used . somehow duncan sheik " high " last song i would think remixing . it wasn't bad trance song but it just not fit songs it stuck . songs started sound like one repetitive loop middle cd i found myself literally bored tears . i hated way sylver livin ' my life " ended where plummet " damaged 03 " began . just goes show me what little skills dave waxman dj . i may not dj , let alone know how mix songs but i wouldn't botched job like he those two songs . still i adored songs like 4 strings ' " let it rain " , sylver " livin ' my life " , " never " roc project feat . tina arena . female vocals infectious melodies what i find irresistable trance music , especially those songs . i would given this cd 3 stars but i loved those songs last three songs so much i decided generous . far mixed cds goes , " ultra trance 2 " not one best mixed cds i ever heard but not one best . series needs dj who actually make music flow one cohesive unit	1
this one first japanese traditional music cds i wanted . if you watch lot kung foo movies , you recognize this sound it usually played during meditation or beginning fight scene . this great cd if you wanting relax or it would great play during dinner subtle background music . if you wanting something more upbeat , i highly suggest " japanese taiko " joji hirota	1
my money , " omen " trilogy most fascinating progression styles i heard soundtracks movie series . first one bagged oscar provided gothic power energized movie . second one beating rawness combined electronic edge . but number three --" final conflict " my opinion tops not only series , but one goldsmith best works . this soundtrack continues portray ominous evil this series , but completely different style others . unlike choral electronic driven entries before , goldsmith really lets whole orchestra loose here . addition movie allows him balance portrayal ultimate evil ultimate good ... contrast makes some great listening . my favorite tracks : " main title " , absolutely outstanding " hunt " . " second coming " riveting well . it shame music attached mediocre movie . it not likely this soundtrack get attention goldmith received " star trek " or even first " omen " . varese sarabande terrific job this release however , this remains underrated score deserves more attention	1
this almost perfect album . it so close i give it 5 stars . other reviewers written , there no one compare amy rigby , but like everyone else i'll try . i would describe her 60% lucinda williams her alt-country sound 40% jill sobule her witty poinant lyrics . i enjoyed every song this album first song " wait till i get you home " which upbeat just made me smile , last song " sleeping moon " beautiful lush song felt too short . you wished it would go little longer , like relationship song . every song painted picture . some people say this album good her first album " diary mod housewife " , but i think it better . songs this album seems more " developed " , more confident . it feeling someone who ease who they their music . her first album , although strong , felt like she tried too hard . only reason why i described this album " almost " perfect because fourth track " let me little bit " . this song seemed weaker than other songs , but even this song pretty good . i know this review very general not very helpful determining whether spend your hard earned money it or not ; all i say " buy album , you won't disappointed .	1

this far modest mouse best album . it hard most people understand first . this album whole different feel it than rest their albums . this first modest mouse album i ever heard , i couldn't get into it didn't want first . but friend convinced me sit through it 3 or 4 times , now i can't get enough it . yourself huge favor buy this album . close your eyes listen it all way through one or twice , if you still don't like it , you poor taste music you suck . if you love this album like i , you'll also love ugly casanova album titled sharpen your teeth . great modest mouse album fruit ate itself	1
powerlight one their best albums ever . i would rate this par faces raise album where each track superbly produced different other tracks . 2 choruses heart heart subtley different each other this point exemplifies musical subtlties present across album . even after 16 years , i still get lift hearing tracks . miracles so powerful , maurice voice consistent clear . fall love me so simply catchy chord changes during intro spine tingling . unfortunately , they went downhill here , but it would nice see this line up return studio again	1
it surprising how many mediocre artists sell so many records , how really interesting artists disappear into obscurity . linda perhacs no exception . blessed beautiful clear voice , batch lovely songs mind willing experiment , she produced stunning work which long lost world but thankfully brought light again . album flying start " chimacum rain " which sets tone rest : layers stunning vocals sympathetic effective backing . " paper mountain man " less unique but still very good , reminds listener heart . songs like " dolphin " , " call river " " morning colors " especially remind me tim buckley great happy/sad blue afternoon period . least succesful this great set songs " moons cattails " , which sounds too contrived less ' spontaneous ' if you . title song " parallellograms " surprising lyrics ( lot mathematical words ) daring experimental break , which also hints tim buckley work - unique superb " starsailor " . me , winner this fine collection " hey , who really cares " : nothing strange or daring there , but very gentle , melancholic simply beautiful . all this album head above many works sold millions it deserves far greater audience . happily , it seems linda perhacs decided enter world music again produce new album ( only her second since end sixties ) end this year . hopefully this new album ( if it good first one ) cause more deserving response .	1
this latest installmenet myrtle beach show typical panic . easily proving it worth . i might give light fuse get away edge my favorite live release . but live myrtle beach certainly gets job , fresh new batch jam , while we all start getting juiced tour . no phish , dead , ... over year off . prepare hottest , hungryest tour jam scene yrs . definately take this disc you shows	1
those get this album it nothing short masterpiece . those don't it anything but masterpiece . before judging this album one way or other i recommend multiple listenings over fairly extended period time . try listening it 8 or 9 times over period couple weeks . i've actually known people who first thought this album awful , but after while their ears opened up it they absolutley loved it .	1
many years i looking thorough rick astley greatest hits package . finally this one issued . i think rick great voice , it shame his career sort died . i suspect he written off dance/pop teen idol never really taken seriously . but i think his voice every bit good josh groban , he should seriously pursue kind career josh groban . i loved rick updeat dance tunes , but ballads like " cry help " " hopelessly " showed his true vocal prowess . i also like some his songs not perform well here states such " ones you love " his remake " ain't too proud beg " . all his hits here , big ones not so big ones . i recommend this cd highly .	1
this album well worth purchase if you enjoy electronica . however , electronica wide range styles ranging your big beat your trance what you . if you like dance beats steady change like cool off more down-tempo things this album combines all elements , steady listen	1
" flush " one alice best lp , hands down . those who disappointed it too busy looking something else . this record straight-forward rock bit new-wave era flavor . no ballads , anthems , or shockers here . other words , not what many come expect alice cooper , but ten quick gutsy rockers averaging slightly less than three minutes piece some pretty hilarious lyrics . while all songs great , ones i love best " model citizen " , " pain " , " clones " . saw " flush fashion " show ny palladium ' 81 , thought it great . overall feel sort like " west side story " tone " school out " lp bit " clockwork orange " twist . very stripped down comparison extravaganzas alice known , but not disappointment	1
i fan king over 15 years now ( wow , long time ) , i've fortunate seen them concert almost 30 times , i've met them hung out them ( after shows ) many times . i appreciation king band individuals - they all seem like great guys , especially jerry . i asked jerry 3 years ago solo album him , he said he working putting something together . i real excited when it finally released last year . i'm really happy jerry able get his music finished put out there fans . but same time , i'm little disappointed end result . music this album really , really good . assuming jerry wrote all/most music , he good sense melody transition within each song . some songs still growing me , but my favorites " no love " " all way home " . i really like acoustic base used most songs - acoustic guitars missing recent king albums . one thing i don't like in-your-face presence electric guitars . there isn't much sonic " real estate " subtle acoustic guitars bold electric guitars . thing bothers me bit lyrics . lyrical content doesn't bother me , fact , ty last solo album ' safety ' similar theme . but , times , lyrics make absolutely no sense . i'm guessing jerry using words almost instruments , lyrics there compliment whole song rather than tell story . my biggest complaint would production this cd . ty awesome guitarist , but i think he should leave production duties someone else ( thankfully , new king cd produced michael wagner ) . drums sound ok , but cymbals buried mix lack crispness sparkle . bass guitar almost non-existent mix , times , electric guitars sound muddy . i realize ty basically free resource jerry , but i can't help but think how much better this cd would sound some really good production . overall , i like this cd although my comments above may sound harsh , i'm audio engineer i critique these things every cd i buy . coincidentally , i don't buy many cd these days because i can't stand most music put out . jerry cd really good effort , it cd get lot rotation my cd changer	1
very good movie -- would preferred different ending , but that way it went	1

dualdisc not play mid high end players . while i could get dvd side mostly play , " cd " not work all . find out what problem i went onkyo web site . their players not support this format since " cd " side not actually cd ( accorning philips ) . so if you play this disc it ruins your player , player warrenty void since this disc not supported format . beware ! oh , what music i hear 5.1 side quite impressive	-1
straight up : dip set garbage . this album no exception , although comparison all albums they released , this one better ones . trufully , cam'ron very limited lyrical skills , it displays throughout this album . although during this time this album released , he just signed jay-z roc-a-fella records ( you saw how long lasted ) . also around this time , some dip set artists ( jim jones juelz santana ) starting surface . they themselves also weigh this album down . i like first single " oh boy " . also second single " hey ma " good also . album hugh highlight would " welcome new york " featuring jay-z , well thought ou t.t he album also many low points . lot these songs like " loosing weight 2 " shows how very limited cam'ron skills behind mic . memphis bleek beanie sigel absolutely nothing song " roc " . production good , like daz produced " leave me alone " , but cam couldn't pull it together . just blaze kanye west would also toss few beats this album also . " come home me " average best . it few good songs lot skip material . if you're used hearing cam albums , then you might want check this out few good tracks , or download it hear how it sounds like . this isn't one i could fully get into . lyrics : cproduction : b+guest appearances : c-musical vibes : coverall : cfavorite tracks : oh boy , welcome new york city , hey ma , peace everyone	1
appleseed cast went little bit more experimental this album , it turns out perfectly . they kept their amazing sound , yet altered it , matured it , complete mellow guitar riffs , intense hooks . only thing i didn't like this album even though it instrumental parts amazing , there extremely less emphasis vocals , one things drew me into band . overall , if you want something really enjoy road trip , or while you're your desk working , pick this up	1

damn ! peter keeps sinking deeper into underground this compilation reflects his new location . exception few tracks some fractured loops , hardly vocal sight , just hard , dirty , nasty tribal drums mixed jagged techy melody fragments electro synth washes bleeps . energy this one just builds , builds , keeps building . peter trademark sexy vibe ... this may peter best mix cd date ; some repeat listenings needed before it takes away title his essential mix . if you rauhofer or * 69 fan you've already ordered this . if not this convert you	1

let face it : none this stuff supposed make sense . when it released , it became icon drug-hazed reality . little scraps words images float out , intertwine intruigingly , then drift away again . what lessons we supposed take ? end life , we all children again , chasing down ice cream truck . but what we internalized more rote - phrases expressing life essential absurdity pointlessness . but timeless : " say , what chance returning deceased war verteran ... " true during viet nam - true now during iraq . well , think it over - then take off your shoes	1

all stars universe my rating this album bud . bud together monk probably tadd dameron , bebop piano . period . this album shooted bud top stairs bebop pantheon . i can't judge this album ... it masterpiece twenthieth century , how could you rate it simply " five stars " . we way over here . this album you'll find some bud wildest interpretations standard tunes some his wonderful compositions such celia or fruit . this something pointed out clearly , bud not only greatest bop pianist but fantastic composer too . he one few who equalled parker dameron bop lines writing . bouncing bud , dance infidels ( not presented here ) , hallucinations , tempus fuge it , celia , fruit many more form alltogether picture impressive composer unlimited fantasy creativity ( not mentioning monster chops bud piano ) . i suggest this album every jazz lover , but particular those so love new generation pianists ... all bill evans keith jarrett " alumni " scandinavia . come back root . bud man . strange fact . i version this album made sudamerican market which 20 tunes . there 7 more tunes after body soul , they taken different sessions i guess . those tunes : oblivion , dusk sandi , hallucinations , fruit , nightingale sang berkley square , just one those things , last time i saw paris . booklet doesn't say almost anything these tunes ( some them bud alone ) , but quality this music i judge myself .... stellar . jazz giant masterpiece , buy it don't esitate .	1
out amon tobin first three albums , it extremely tough pick best one . if i pressed , i would name this very close second " supermodified " just barely ahead " bricolage " . i'm talking two points separating three albums . said , " permutation " different beast than his debut album . released only year after " bricolage " , this album continues one veins , yet infused darker jazz sensibility create dense headrush leaves you breathless , eager start again . some amon best work this disc , " sordid " featured toyota commercial great effect . this album 70 minutes non-stop brilliant sample cut-ups melodies hidden underneath jerky drum-n-bass programming , trip takes you throughout endless permutations ( sorry ) sound space , ends " nova " , close perfect chill song any written . i cannot say enough good things this album	1
pretty good hard-core rap , includes usual self-aggrandizing macho posturing , but rhymes entertaining , music sophisticated . there nothing really special or unique here , everything atl number others , but they what they well , admirable . fans ice , ice cube pe should find much admire . `another execution ' excellent reggae influenced rap " menace society ' also quite good	1
if you never listened son volt , not buy this album ! son volt one those bands i listen very long time . i love their lyrics style playing combining folk , blues , rock music . however , this " retrospective " missing several key songs including " catching " , " cemetery savior " , " right through " , " question " , " blind hope " , " caryatid easy " , " live free . " i am not biggest son volt fan , but i least know these songs really define son volt stint music industry , not covers or mediocre acoustic performances . this album , like many other compilations , lousy attempt record company make little more money off band stagnant . son volt still kicks ass	1
37 i'm old enough remember all teddy solo work when it first released played local rb radio . my moms bought albums , 45s or 8 tracks we enjoyed music . now i'm older listened lots lots " performers " no real vocal talent , i've truly come appreciate genuine talent whose passion truly felt his music . that almost non-existent today . i like all songs . this good collection . however close follower teddy decades , if i building collection limited only one cd i would omitted following : " life song " , " more i get " , " shout scream " " we try " , instead included : " hold me " , " love power " , " it don't hurt now " " my latest , my greatest inspiration " . i think would ultimate , single cd teddy collection . overall this cd well worth money ; far disappointing . but i believe many long time teddy fans would make same substitutions i suggested	1
darn good album brilliant song quot ; apple my eyequot ; . pete ham beautiful voice fantastic sentiment leaving behind beatles label . there ever anyone like him since ? hopefully this reissue remastered . all material great . ham guitar end quot ; constitutionquot ; excellent . molland quot ; i love youquot ; favorite mine . too bad he turned out such dip , putting out atrociously produced not-really live lp , let's-make-a-quick-buck collection some demos his shoddy , his horribly embarrassing covers cd many badfinger classics take away people buying legitimate stuff . joey --- come back reality !! it not money --- granted this album isn't perfect , like quot ; straight up , quot ; but it my second favorite badfinger lp . thanks mike . turning me it	1
this album truly something else , even though i nothing but positive things say all madonna albums . although her albums always differ each other ( only similar thing them they all rock ) , this one takes whole new direction whole new way ( techno/electronica ) . best tracks album : drowned world/substitute love , ray light , skin , nothing really matters , frozen , power goodbye . sounds interesting lyrics , she new things her vocals .	1

stellar regions very cool collection studio outtakes later years coltrane life . playing great it wonderful hear his exploration so many new ideas . it marvel think how further developed these songs might become if coltrane lived longer . i'm glad this released public because it stands fascinating audio document one greatest musical minds world ever known . i'd recommend this experienced fans john coltrane , not those who just beginning their search through his vast back catalogue	1
i don't exactly consider myself ostrich my head sand , but somehow i never discovered joe . until six months ago . here i've sitting around all this time waiting ( then complaining ) new albums kenny wayne ., jonny lang , like , then here this guy who just blows all those guys out water sitting right front my nose ! amazon even kept recommending him me their great little " recommender " pops up when you get their website , but i've ignoring all like fool . then recently i heard dj announce song joe bonamassa , i knocked out ! coincidentally , i saw joe open up b.b. king week later , sold hook line sinker . i bought one his cd right there afterwards , him sign it , shook his hand told him he new fan . amusingly , during his performance he recommended audience buy any one his cds sold after his set , jokingly ( i hope ) adding , " ... well , maybe not second one . " well , i assure you it big joke , because this album great all way through . some hard rock , some acoustic stuff , amazing hendrix-style tune ( pain sorrow) -- all great stuff . definitely buy cd , but try find package bonus dvd if you . this guy incredible . he every guitar player i've into all rolled up into one , yet he his own man same time . this cd/dvd box set worth twice price . i thought dvd might one , maybe two songs like some those goofy dvd " singles " come extra cd . dude , dvd almost two hours long , music smokes ! sound isn't dts 5.1 , you'll turn up volume your stereo little higher than when playing dts or dolby 5.1 concert dvd , but sound still very good . this guy got it all -- amazing , shredding guitar chops , blues feel galore , great voice . don't stay dark like i past five years -- buy his whole catalog ! you won't regret it !!!!	1

i just couldn't stand this album . they sound like billion other bands except 100 times worse . i don't see why people would listen it . there so many other good christian bands out there . example my favorite band mxpx . supertones , five iron frenzy , calibretto 13 , craig brother , roper , even relient better . i , unfortunately , seen them live . they opened supertones . they not put good show . cd . it just no originality . it would much better if they something new , not something everyone heard billion times before . you should not buy this cd , i recomend buying any mxpx cds . they amazing .	-1

i've owned this cd several years now , but never gave it serious listen until just other day . what i heard astounded me ! gary burton not only assembled some finest tango musicians argentina produce this cd him , he managed select playlist some what i consider piazzolla finest work : tanguedia , triunfal , soledad , revirado , decarisimo , concierto para quinteto , among others . many musicians long history working one piazzolla , so every note seems spring forth effortlessly . though one not often associate vibes tango , burton manages work them unobtrusively seem natural part musical flow . his vibes shine especially biyuya , caliente , tanguedia , concierto para quinteto . soledad , lead bandoneon skillfully replaced burton vibes . cd so good it often seems like piazzolla himself performing . love astor , burton ensemble offers more than hour spectacular music . if you love astor well , it behooves you add this cd your collection	1

i originally wrote looong @$$ review this cd because it so outstanding , but some strange reason it , several other reviews i wrote , not get posted -- so , i very brief point this review ... plush bomb-diggety -- if i may steal old mid-90s rb cliche ! cd itself goes beyond conventional chill-out reaches new level genre . indeed , plush gushes wonderfully everything 2-step ( steve austeen w/gillian o'donovan ) groovy-ambient-funk ( wonderbraa , alex cortiz , mum quantic ) acid jazz ( cadien hatler ) samba ( s-tone victor davies ) everything . there even killer , albeit more laid-back , remake prince " controversy " hefner actually ( my opinion ) sounds better than original ... i always said it takes real skill effrontery redo anything prince ! other chill-out albums should take notes plush trying create something new very mundane world chill-out/downtempo music ... after listening this set it obvious there more style music than drone beats hallucinogenic singers ... plush indeed set new standard chill-out -- if you even begin categorize it format . now , let hope this review gets posted this time !	1

jeez , i feel like it 70 again ; defending mccartney : anyone who doesn't get it : his solo work not beatles . he never seemed care much lyrics " meaning " , opposed john george , but focused great melody , harmony , catchy , if sometimes almost meaningless , lyrics . no one seemed mind when he it beatles ......... all amazing . this album may his best ; simple songs , simply recorded , heartfelt . his tunes lyrics deceptively simple ( junk , man we lonely ) but listen closely what he saying . he doesn't shove your face how he feels , unlike lennon " how you sleep " or even ringo " boogaloo " . this album first glimpse we all got into who what beatles , basic it , opens new door . still my top ten	1

this album elton john bernie taupin sixth album three years . during time elton explored variety sounds , trying find his sound . " madman across water " cusp quest would fully realized elton next album , " honky chateau . " while seeking his sound elton managed demonstrate incredible potential broadly manifested this album . first five songs particularly show wonderful range styles compositions ranging solid pop " tiny dancer " " levon " heavily orchestrated " madman across water " " indian sunset . " lyrics occasionally murky often misquoted . yet , there lot power piano backing arrangements incredible . still maturing voice elton new different time , appealed broad array audiences trying find stability after psychedelic turbulent 60s . one interesting feature some elton early music periodic influence gospel or soul music , most strongly seen this album " all nasties . " influence would not last much longer elton went down musically more cohesive path this point . over time elton played keyboards various types , but his recent album " songs west coast " he returned piano once again , recalling relative innocence this early music , though maturity talented , seasoned artist . i think it tribute power this early music elton returned it once again album released decades after this album . music this type incredible amount power appeals much emotion it ear . listen again artist made it big based power his music not over-polished commercial pop hyped many fm stations today . truly solid album any collection .	1

more i learn bob dylan musical background reading biographies his own chronicles vol . 1 well listening music he influenced , more i appreciate his eponymous debut album . it energetic collection somewhat dark folk traditional covers ( much like many folksingers early 60 greenwich village scene ) couple his fledgling originals . all all it great debut -- he sings songs plays harmonica really energetically , somewhat more forced wheezy accent than he usually sang , originals two best songs album , showing spark creativity he would later fan into prolific blaze . album collection folk songs dylan singing clubs coffeehouses around new york , it both reflects his sponge-like absorption influences well his proclivity borrow his contemporaries . few songs copped arrangements his friend mentor , dave van ronk , like " fixin ' die " " house rising son . " fact , when van ronk heard album , he exclaimed , " bobby lifted my arrangement ! dylan got his just desserts , however , when animals made rock hit out his arrangement " rising sun . " other songs culled anthology american folk music , ( one most important folk collections dylan listened ) like album closer " see my grave kept clean . " album two originals , " talkin ' new york " " song woody , " both pay homage woody guthrie different ways . first humorous but very true life story dylan early days new york , which he jokingly mispronounces " greenwich " rolls off casual talking blues style his idol , guthrie . second less borrowing guthrie music , but tribute . dylan addresses his observations state world woody , who big hand helping young singer start frame his worldview . it touching original great prelude classic original dylan tunes come . overall , it strong but not phenomenal album -- world would later find out , dylan true magic songwriting , though his interpretive folk enjoyable true spirit songs , it nowhere near transcendent his greatest work soon come . listen hear his roots folksinger , anticipate magic come	1
i just found out couple days ago new caliban album coming out , i immediately couldn't wait get my hands it ( upon it release , soon store opened i got my copy ! ) anyway , this pretty good album like last , except it very straight forward this time around . it doesn't sound technical , but it still heavy sound you would expect band . only reason why i'm not giving it 5 stars because i hear way too many similarities trivium brilliant album released last year ' ascendancy ' i lay dying awesome ' shadows security .

it sounds weird , doesn't it , because everybody these days makes lame assumptions all melodeath bands hail sweden , denmark , poland , etc . well , if you thought true , you're dead wrong . hailing state virginia comes two masterminds compose technical melodic death metal group arsis . james malone ( guitarist/songwriter ) michael van dyne ( drums ) execute their talent well this cd . even though they may perform live 4-piece , two founding members real talent behind arsis . now , cd . this cd make you s**t your pants first time you listen it . guitars sound like they digital effect them , bringing out their technicality . drumming fast f**k . this cd appeal fans later carcass , arch enemy , gates . this could easily outrival " slaughter soul " gates greatest true melodeath cd invented . if you fan technical death , melodeath , or just plain metal , you need this .	1

there bumper crop strong discs multitude very talented international tenors this past year - juan diego florez , roberto alagna , marcello alvarez , ramon vargas joseph calleja most prominent . right up there among this select brethren this debut recording mexican tenor rolando villaz�n . deep , fulsome sound his voice , he brings sharp emotive power his performance without overdoing it some others pool pagliacci tears . fact , villaz�n true lyric tenor genuine understanding pianissimo . it near-flawless voice seems ideal lovers would-be lovers mainstays italian opera . verdi , puccini donizetti standard fare such robust voice , respect , program somewhat predictable . truth told , i could without " la donna � mobile " verdi " rigoletto " , which most overplayed italian song this side " o sole mio " . same time , he provides some nice surprises beginning first track , stunning aria cilea " l'arlesiana " , " la solita storia " , where his vocal control exemplary . coincidentally , calleja performs same song his similarly programmed " tenor arias " ; both versions distinctive memorable . regardless , even old warhorses performed ad infinitum likes pavarotti domingo , villaz�n brings dramatic clarity , lyrical command purity tone familiar numbers such carlo act i aria , " io l'ho perduta ... lo la vidi " verdi " don carlo " ; marcello act iv recitativo , " il duca d'alba inosservato ... angelo casto bel " donizetti " il duca d'alba " ; rodolfo act i aria , " che gelida manina " puccini " la boheme " . what comes across consistently virile , full-bodied voice , almost baritone weight quality , makes slightest quiver his phrasing very effective shading his performances . example , if you compare villaz�n version calleja donizetti concluding aria , " tombe degli avi miel ... fra poco " " lucia di lammermoor " , villaz�n delivers more emotionally naked rendition reveals edgar heroic lover , whereas calleja sings more cautious haunted vulnerability makes his edgar more sensitive soul . neither right or wrong , just different . villaz�n rounds out his program early 20th-century so-called " belto " selections puccini mascagni balance bel canto standards . throughout this impressive debut , he ably accompanied masterful musical direction marcello viatti leading m�nchner rundfunkorchester . i still think jury out far his designation " fourth tenor " ( he only 32 ) , but given what he accomplished here , i certainly think villaz�n considered true contender	1

while brad fiedel always true musical voice terminator ; marco beltrami ( who composed scores scream trilogy , joy ride , mimic , resident evil marilyn manson ) fine job scoring this overhauled installment terminator series . replacing fiedel synth-laced score more conventional metal themed score , beltrami conceived above average film score falls short it predecessor , but just like new film , succeeds it own right . first half disc excellent , but begins lose steam before picking up again brief re-imagining fiedel classic awe-inspiring termiantor theme . last two songs totally out place here , absolutely worthless terms film . besides , this worth owning any terminator fan	1
i listened this c.d. many times before . i really liked most it . i really liked first 2 songs it , like quot ; pines rome : i pini di villa borghesequot ; ( track 1 ) , quot ; pines rome : iii pini del gianicoloquot ; ( track 2 ) , i also liked song called quot ; grand canyon suite : cloudburstquot ; . several minutes song sounding little scary though , like you big nightmare quot ; yellowstonequot ; , it all getting destroyed bad , terrible storm , coming end . but it still great instroments playing it , some it sounded beautiful , like making up beauty area around yellowstone grand canyon . i very much too liked it lot great songs some quot ; fresh airequot ; albums . they all sounded like big outside nature . first 2 songs c.d. ( which two quot ; pines romequot ; songs produced early 1900 italian musician named ottorino respighi ) reminded me there yellowstone watching birds other things flying beautiful sky past trees , me exploring region . first quot ; pines romequot ; song reminded me seeing lots pretty white snow covering beautiful big small pine trees mountains yellowstone , looking down higher elevations beautiful frozen lakes over beautiful sunset , viewing more far views snow covered mountains . second quot ; pines romequot ; song reminded me looking down different great far views , seeing lots different great nature there . it reminded me slowly walking down hill or mountain into woods grounds yellowstone , looking bunch lakes slow moving waterfalls , watching water animals live them swimming around . plus , it reminds me watching all kinds beautiful birds flying , looking stuff turning color there changing season autumn . i really loved all music . it reminds me really going into national park , exploring it , time my life doing it	1

i followed enigma project long time , haven't found myself disappointed single release thus far . ( , considering i am reviewing older album . ) ' cross changes , ' second chapter enigma project , offers philosophical insight into micheal cr�tu personal beliefs , form ' enigmatic ' symphony soft composition chanson . while each album seems hold it own unique interpretation life , i believe purpose this album inspire love , peace wholeness within its listeners . lyrical value ' cross changes ' seems surpass its instrumental quality , which , times , rather poor comparison some micheal other works . however , lyrics reassuring inspiring , none-the-less , make entire experience worthwhile . buyers who curious enigma probably shouldn't start this album , it seems one those things you appreciate only after hearing some latter releases . ( my case , least . ) first album i purchased ' love , sensuality , devotion ' ( greatest hits album ) -- good start , considering you get fair idea what enigma all . way , i am curious track number 2 -- everytime i listen it , i faintly hear sandra chanting " open your heart , push limits ... " background , though it could just my imagination . it strange i mention , because ' push limits ' released after this album	1
representative fine mix traditional irish music chieftains perform , this concert gives fan chieftains nice sampling what they're good occasional error judgement accompanies live performance . highlights include fine opening medley gives band chance show how well they play together , matt malloy outstanding flute solo " mason apron , " still stuns me every time i listen it , closing medley allows each member shine . but guest stars don't really work me , nanci griffith doesn't bad job but adds nothing special concert roger daltrey sounds out his element " raglan road , " while " behind blue eyes " interesting worked through chieftains sound it just doesn't fit here . i am sure " stone " ( special dance when two lovers meet ) fine when you see it , it loses bit cd . but these not major problems sound solid concert performance . this fan , it pretty good time	1

quot ; portrait sonny crissquot ; mixed album underrated alto sax wizard . while slower numbers quot ; clear day , quot ; god bless childquot ; quot ; smilequot ; magical numbers , remainder album not quite hold up . first tune quot ; million or more timesquot ; not very creative , basically sounds like 60s tv show theme song ( we say quot ; hoping cut hit singlequot ;) . jazz standard quot ; weequot ; quot ; blues closetquot ; swinging but this 1967 , not 1957 , band walter davis , paul chambers ( especially ) alan dawson , i expected it more experimental . instead , quartet seems more home slower tempo ballads . all , quot ; portrait sonny crissquot ; deserves 3 1/2 stars , but since i can't i rounded it up . if you want get better portrait sonny , check out newly released quot ; complete imperial sessionsquot ; blue note	1

this , hands down , best creation siccmade ever released . granted , i haven't heard many releases siccmade clique even dislike few rappers label . i've heard quite bit , though , including but not limited sicx two albums , debut dead 4 life course this kut . i got soundtrack movie now eat project(also featuring sicx , but only movie . yes , this sucks . even though now eat advertises sicx featured ) i've heard many brotha lynch x-raided records(lynch , sicx original swartzaniggas ) . anyway , all kutz siccmade i've heard , my opinion this best them(although i'm sure most would argue ' seasons da siccness ' ) . sicx started out rough , cheap production black market , cedrick singleton released ' dead 4 life ' , which its own time would cult classic . due black market drama(as usual ) , album not released immediately after recording sat quite few years . around time album recorded(early 90 ) many other classics came effect , including x psycho active brotha lynch ep 24 deep seasons . comparing this album other hardcore releases set sicx far normal . course , most siccmade artists definitely far norm . sicx got reputation credibility horror stories he rapped no one doubted him second . fast forward february 1999 . siccmade finally got their start buisness , working acts such loki(a so-so white rapper sacramento ) , brotha lynch woman zagg , his brothers sicx tall cann . siccmade released sicx second effort , if these walls could talk . production brotha lynch hung , art battle sicx , handful fingatips , beats impeccable addicting . every single beat album smashes . its not too different normal formula lynch uses , but yet it stands its own when compared other albums production(definitely better then dead 4 life , far ) . sicx got bust beats he actually feeling instrumentals unique their own way . slow beats ' one(featuring loki d-dubb)'and killing fields'(originally meant ' head drama ' mixtape ) pounding bass ' not cho average ' , all songs album perfectly mold together(aside killing fields ) . lyrically , this album harder then anything loki , zagg , cos , or anybody could even dream writing . i would say sure brotha lynch sicx illest lyrics you'll hear out sacramento . sicx paints dark pictures , covering topics sherm-smoking 40-swiggin ' raping woman front her children . most people don't understand sicx because he his music truly sick core . thats exactly why i love it . its not specific one style , either . its got gangsta , hardcore , horror , shock value . my favorite track ' razors alcohol ' featuring t-t he-time siccmade roster , also known correctly swartzaniggas . this track features cos , tall cann , sicx , fignaytion production brotha lynch hung . lyrics what caught me , after turning subwoofers , it over . you'll hear it understand . crank up bass volume , crack open 40 rap . fignaytion sicx owned track , although cos tall cann g first verse almost comparable . fignaytion my favorite rappers sicc , although he no longer swartzaniggas . fignaytion also makes appearance ' basket case ' , my second favorite track . song begins fig mic , ' tombstones my mind ' , fig spits hard verse . his voice more unique than other artists sicc . he blends well tracks hes sicx . i would loved hear album them , although thats out question . hell , i would love hear album sicx . who knows when this , sicx currently incarcerated undetermined amount time . sicx stay up keep representing like real gang-banger he . confusing tid-bit , back cover , bottom mauroon-colored letters , lists ' blood drop ' outro but nowhere heard . sicx doesn't " talk " " talk " like almost every rapper out there right now . which why hes out jail since he young man record psychotic behavior . buy this album , its definitely worth it . i even bought two gave one homie . support sicx . this latest release sicx but hopefully not last . check ' dead 4 life ' if you like this album . i own both , they're excellent . i bump it daily , tweed session isn't complete without kick-back tracks ' marination(featuring d-dubb )' or ' unholy ' background . free sicx . 66 point 6 yo fm dial	1
stone roses ' " turns into stone " includes alternative take " elephant stone " ( interesting , but not good one band monumental debut ) , full version " fool gold " ( same one heard version debut commonly available ) , b-sides , songs written before after their first album . except " simone " ( one their trademark backwards songs ) , all this available " complete stone roses " ( together more alternative takes ) , though , pointed out previous reviews , some songs truncated " complete " order fit 21 songs . so , question day whether it worth it get " turns into stone . " before we answer query , i want talk album itself . it some these early tracks we hear band biggest influences . one hand , there no question they borrowed some more poppy , dare i say bubblegum bands mid-sixties , such herman hermits gerry pacemakers . other hand , one clearly hears influence mid-sixties psychedelia such byrds jefferson airplane . course , roses ' first album expanded these sounds gave birth late 80s brit-pop movement ( i.e blur , oasis , happy mondays ) , great influence ( together my bloody valentine ) over " shoegazer " sound ( i.e. catherine wheel , ride , slowdive ) . i really like all herman hermits type songs , especially " mersey paradise " ( which i wish spot first album , together " sally cinnamon " ) . " something burning " reminds me alot mellower version " fool gold , " whereas "" one love " comes dangerously close self-parody . answer question posed above it depends how big stone roses fan you . die-hard fans , listening shortened version " one love " " something burning , " seems inadequate almost cruel rocking instrumental part songs , basically showcasing john squire ( perhaps reni too ) , edited out . rest , " complete stone roses " supplies enough supplement roses ' two primary studio recordings , making this album somewhat superfluous	1

i heard this cd ( 25 romantic classics ) . main problem 25 tracks most them not pure romantic music . air string could not classified quot ; romanticquot ; because general theme closer tragic than romantic . same thing goes vivaldi allegro . performance mozart piano concerto made poor " israel chamber orchestra " weak , i am still wondering putting this performance cd although there dozens great performances mozrat piano concertos . performance beethoven fur elise quite poor . it went faster than usual , addition extreme use sustaining pedal . i believe any amateur could perform it better than soloist here . i wonder why chopin prelude no . 7 such cd , its quite out any conceivable thematic context addition short . preludes such no . 6 ( tolling bells ) no . 15 ( raindrops ) could much better such cd romantic music . add , pianist didn't use tempo rubato playing this piece . so semi-romantic piece totally destroyed . rest tracks too humble serious critic . i don't believe this cd makes any addition any classical collection	1
few records justifiably claim " groundbreaking " , but here one - mesmerising example two highly creative musicians peak their powers pushing their ideas out edge . using infectious poly-rhythms jerky , high tension riffs vocals permeated their brilliantly successful collaboration talking heads ' " remain light " their starting point , they mix-in ingenious looped samples insidious guitar , synthesizer percussion back-beats produce something completely unique . not only like nothing else around time but , like all truly great albums , one hasn't aged time . often sounding more like inventive slice modern " electronica/dance " it almost impossible believe it produced over twenty years ago ... , course , great deal what followed since traced back this amazing record . darker far more " left-field " than " remain light " , " my life bush ghosts " no easy listen , but repeat playing it becomes equally addictive ... worthy successor wholly successful exploration just how far brian eno david byrne complex fusions electronica rock could taken . file under " essential , timeless under-rated slice musical genius " .	1

least abrasive , altogether , most listenable form heavy metal 80s empire know pop-metal . groups , mostly california england , began forsaking heavy riffs flashy solos favor melodic pop songs clean , shiny production . def leppard definitive group play this kind rock . sexy , photo ready boys long curly hair , they took metal world , charts , storm . band originaly part " new wave british heavy metal " where british bands played metal faster more libido than ever before . soon , however , they cleaned up their work they helped start pop-metal scene dominated charts during 80s . production their hit album " pyromania " very smooth clean all rough edges most rawness removed . it opens anthemic rocker " rock rock til you drop " which sounds like ac/dc playing it safe . many track such emotional power ballad " photograph " show band feels quite vulnerable times constantly trying make very serious statements . most , if not all songs , make use pop hooks harmonic choruses though there occasional riff or guitar solo . mtv ( back before it turned evil ) major player band success . videos aided band hits they became network usual darlings . though their music essentially pop/rock , it hardest most abrasive form pop/rock ever played . pop-metal created almost sub-culture which all teens wanted grow their hair out put ratt warrent posters their walls . pop hair-metal eventually die off , particularly when nirvana nevermind came out , but records still sold day more more people becoming fans . though it may not challenging loud other metals , pop-metal bands , like def leppard , offer great way listen something easy see what 80s metal movement all . pyromania may place start .	1

firehouse zone this time . no doubt it . songwriting superb this easily their best release quot ; good acousticsquot ; coming close second . melodies smooth lyrics better than usual . quot ; day week weatherquot ; got best firehouse song ever . quot ; acid rainquot ; quot ; if it changesquot ; also dynamite . so good songwriting this time around , you almost forgive them previous childish lyrics like quot ; rock radio/turn it up ' til your speakers blow ! quot ; hey , let fair , they've matured lot these songs aren't disposable their early hits like quot;don't treat me badquot ; . lot groups 80 unmercifully dumped some fairly some unfairly . firehouse lasted because they grown into something more than product it time , they actually make real music . if you compare them pretentious acts like trixter , mr. big , lillian axe , you see why they out-lasted their competetion . some not familiar this genre often compare bands like firehouse bon jovi which not fair comparison . bon jovi while musically competent , doesn't songwriting talent firehouse . it shame their bass player quit after this album because i think he brought lot band sound . his absence sorely apparent their follow-up cd quot ; o2quot ; . summarize , if you recently discovering or re-discovering firehouse you'll pleasantly surprised . they come long way i hope they continue make real music	1

first off , those you wish deftones still sounded like they back adrenaline around fur , go home ya nu-metal lover ! nu-metal , over finished anyone who tries bring it back deserves worse than savage disco record burning day . deftones one lucky bands era actually style something more than just 6 power chords , dread locks angry lyrics . fact , they really only band survived genre music . disturbed may still around , but thats mostly because we still angry rich white kids rebelling against their parents . disturbed message old . deftones message would too , they not evolved like everything else life . if you look all their albums whole , you see they evolved each release , way true artists . sure , you still feel anger tension saturday night wrist , but its evolved ! gone rap metal days , grinding heavy metal adrenaline around fur fame . enter atmospheric more ... alternative ! yes , deftones seemed step into whole new avenue music , blending atmospheric , electronic sounds alternative music , some metal trip hop . well , like you couldn't see coming , they edging their way more mellow style years . i personally feel saturday night wrist one their best records , though i am huge fan their last album , self titled deftones . i thought it portrayed awesome emotion , vast landscape post apocalyptica well rounded record really more collective sound group than any its individual parts . sadly , many not feel same , including band themselves . well , it one sided songwriting session , i see why . saturday night wrist , each member contributed equally , despite their interal battles , able craft amazing album great many memorable songs . songs like " beware ... " , " cherry waves " , " combat " , " kimdracula " , " hole earth " song named after very famous nintendo cheat code my favorite songs , me most accesible . song named after nintento cheat code awesome instrumental , likes which we never heard deftones before . it very emotional creepy must hear ! every track this album great quality it , each very enjoyable , least me . i waitied long time serving deftones , this worth every minute . music , it witstand test time . time weeds out fads true musicians . deftones aged well time , proving they no one trick pony , certainly not just angst ridden children suburbia	1

grainger one group british composers turn century who fascinated oral tradition folk songs which starting disappear earth . holst , vaughan-williams , delius , butterworth , all wrote distillations this wonderful music . grainger even recorded it . this recording few oddities it . perhaps fennell could said not quot ; touch his feminine sidequot ; , so slower , lyrical pieces may not his forte , but some cases they hypnotic quality . county derry certainly sentiment . his performances marked exhilarating virility , he strong passion which maybe chance show itself better wind ensemble recordings , but this one still fennell energy love . also , he may considered symphony orchestra wind ensemble surrounded strings , but i forgive him it because he so lovingly quot ; dished upquot ; * fine collection grainger us , anyway , grainger may shared view well . grainger didn't give us lot time see feel places perceptions any his short pieces , but if you catch them , they certainly there , fennell i think caught them knew them well . molly shore these brief , mystical moments . grainger so worth pursuing , this recording must , so other fennell/grainger recordings . i really don't think anyone sensed poignant beauties grainger little jewels well fennell . * favorite grainger phrase , e.g. , quot ; molly shore , dished up pianoquot	1

schulze first ever solo recording ( 1972)strangely , uses no real synthesizers all ( quite feat someone known premiere synth player electronic music last 30+ years ) , but rather features klaus organ various electronic devises ( sound effects might more appropriate here ) electronically enhanced real string orchestral section . very difficult , music suggests slightly eerie , barren winter landscape , more attentive listener , quite treat . this music not schulze fans his later rhythmically charged drum machine rock music , but listeners avante-guarde music , stockhausen cages world , this really masterpiece . too bad schulze didn't more this before moving into more progressive rock arena .	1

i agree kenny , kittie " spit " insipid pile horse manure . like most other bands this genre , this cd devoid almost any thoughts creativity or ingenuity , not mention vacuum left due lack talent featured . all lyrics hallmark proverbially angst type common these bands . why you girls so angry ? you signed record deal major label ! shoot , you're lives must really suck . they any idea how many bands ( actual talent ) would anything get signed major record label ? obviously this band manufactured catch nu-metal craze only they used four faux goth girls who could barely play their respective instruments . these girls try play boys but they just can't make cut . oooh , power chords over simple drumbeats inaudible bass topped off crummy preteen lyrics sung woman sounds like hissing cat . gee , count me out . not recommended unless you slit my wrist cry my heart out crowd whose suburbia lifestyle must really suck . cry me river . i guess this band could so angry because they know how bad they but i doubt it ..	-1

this one 3 albums fogelberg i'd consider masterpiece , or nearly so ( other two " nether lands " " home free " ) . i'll agree those here who note " someone telling you stories " relatively weak , although backing chorus members " eagles " keep even song throwaway . overall this highly enjoyable acoustic/country/rock/pop - similar some ways eagles , but dan expressive voice , lyrics , melodies actually make it better than most eagles ' work . production joe walsh terrific , there just touch " hotel california " slide-guitar sound , without overly . walsh mainly lets fogelberg other musicians ( who also outstanding ) shine very natural , real sense ; this not all overly layered or gimmicked-up . my favorite track here " raven flies " , " morning sky " standout , but all songs strong ( save above-mentioned " someone ... " ) , fit very well together . getting back what i easily consider dan best 3 albums , " souvenirs " what i'd consider his signature sound , it certainly one his best ever . other hand , " nether lands " no weak tracks , flows well , loaded incredible lyrics music - if decide only one , i suppose it would my top choice very close race . but " nether lands " different sound than typical fogelberg album - quite bit lush orchestration wonderful instrumentation departs standard " country/folk/pop " sound i associate fogelberg . " souvenirs " more live folk/pop concert sound vs . lushly beautiful orchestration " nether lands " . dan first album " home free " very spare intense ; sounds almost if he playing all instruments himself . " home free " little spotty ( many tracks soar his very best - especially opening song , others slightly weak ) but also not missed . " souvenirs " though me most representative df very best work ; it " must " even casual fans .	1

" len cariou , glynis johns , hermione gingold , patricia elliott cast couldn't better . this recording won grammy award , score much deserved tony award . this should every musical theatre lovers collection . " little night music " gets my vote musical most deserves re-filmed . no disrespect hal prince , but elizabeth taylor film wasn't all it should ( julie andrews would perfect role desiree armfeldt ) . hollywood making musicals again - perhaps there hope . if glenn close revive this piece broadway ( rumored ) i hope they tape it they " sweeney todd , " " passion , " " sunday park george " " into woods .
