polarizing filters used eliminate glare non-metallic surfaces like glass or water . they also used increase contrast color saturation your image . i use my polarizer not only eliminate glare , but also make skies nice shade blue or get some " pop " out clouds . there so many options consider when purchasing polarizing filter your needs . instance , linear vs . circular , film or digital versions , or quality vs . price . if you making use ttl or auto-focusing system , circular polarizers designed work those features . linear polarizers their uses , but they manufactured differently may not work . unless you certain , just get circular polarizing filter . there some digital circular polarizers market . i am not sure what makes cir-pl lens better digital opposed film . i use canon 20d digital slr see no problems caused using supposed non-digital filter digital camera . most time , when it comes filters ; you get what you pay . mean you need expensive polarizer ? course not , just sure get right filter your needs . what ever polarizing filter you get , make sure it color neutral prevent unwanted tinting . spending more color balanced filter save time post . if you need multiple filter sizes , consider saving money using step down rings . currently i use hoya pro1 filters , canon polarizing filters i previously owned without question bulkier heavier . weight might not seem like much , but when you stick all your items backpack all extra bits weight add up quickly . i spend good amount time my equipment my back so this big concern me . when it came down images , times i would see browning tint my photos . tint easy clean up photoshop cs2 , but i don't see problem hoya pro1 filter . overall , i would recommend against canon polarizing filters . i originally thought , " it canon , it must quality . " since then i replaced all my canon filters . this filter works , but comes cost disadvantages other similarly priced filters . pros : used film or digital cameras eliminates internal reflections ghosting cons : bulky heavynot neutral color balance	-1
camera worked fine ; however , after six months , it stopped working . i took it pentax authorized repairer pentax refused pay camera because dirt grit zoom mechanism . my use no way abusive . i previous canon powershot s200 lasted forever same usage , until i gave it away . i guess i should stayed canon . i bought pentax its size lightweight , but what good if it doesn't last ! don't get pentax expect long term use out it	-1
after reading many good reviews here , i too bought lenmar battery act second battery my canon digital camera . i totally pleased excellent performance many others noted . only difference i noticed lenmar oem battery lengthy continuous shooting lcd screen camera case got significantly hotter lenmar battery oem . this not problem until i shooting 101 degree day ( lenmar battery ) suddenly screen went black . i could view previously taken pictures ( lcd ok ) but any new photo i tried take black . i read later manual upper operating temperature camera 104 degrees . once camera cooled it worked again while , but black photo problem continued intermittenly few weeks then camera completely stopped taking photos , no matter what . so , it lenmar battery extra heat generation pushing camera over its temperature limit damaging circuitry ? would it happened if cooler running oem battery installed hot day ? i can't say sure , but if you use lenmar battery i would careful operating it very hot 100 degree day ( e.g. use viewfinder , not lcd since generates heat , or turn camera off lot cool down shots ) .	-1
i purchased 510 powershot summer 2005 . after couple time use zoom cameras lens wouldn't work anymore . i cound't take any picture anymore . i contacted canon over this they ask me pay shiping send camera them fix .	-1
this camera probably go down nikon history one its most over-priced disappointing cameras . i bought mine through amazon calumet january 2003 . start , colors never looked right , especially ghastly magenta-toned skin tones . i also bought sb800s ( 3 them ) , thinking cls would great addition . but system uses ir unreliable any situation except very tight environments . camera wonderful feel , viewfinder reasonably good controls . but results disappointing . sensor undersized this class camera considering what its competition ( canon ) offers . nikon finally realized this dec . 13 decided dump all these cameras lowering price $ 1,200 . it just so happened mine melville , n.y. , long list issues repaired while it still under warranty . these include bad af performance since upgrading v2 firmware , bad color , overexposure , blurry images vr lens inconsistent color balance frame frame even when using preset value . i would strongly suggest you don't buy this camera thereby reward nikon producing inferior product originally sold ridiculous price what it offers . indeed , forget nikon go canon	-1
well course i read previous reviews regarding amazon shipping grey-market version this timer figured certainly now they shipping us version ... wrong ! i just received mine today it got international warranty card users manual . i haven't decided if i'm going return it or not but figured anyone else considering ordering this item should advised it appears amazon only shipping grey-market version this unit	-1
when i received camera i thought giving it 5 star because good looking nice picture . after 6 months use , i wish i could give it 0 star . it true it looks good but it very hard hold camera . it droped twice when i took pictures . also lens too small . dirt very easy get onto lens very hard clean b/c it small . thanks dirty lens , picture quality worse than ever . battery very small too . after 6 months use , it not hold enought power shoot 10 pictures ! they put buttons here there fit small space . it not user friendly camera .	-1
this one product bad quality , cap batteries few days i damage enough light needed order sign meets slightly clear , product bad quality i not recommend it him(you , them ) quality price must low	-1
i just got this camera week ago thought it great . but today i tried turn it it completely dead ! i even changed out batteries it still completely dead . this first digital camera i've i bought it because i'm going europe ( two days after it died ) . now i scramble get replacement before i take off . grrrrr !!	-1
should listened reviewer before me . unit arrived dead . neither ac power or car charger worked . tried replacing 4 batteries came it my other known batteries unit still not work	-1
unless you take picture outside , no matter what you , picture comes out blurry . flash doesn't help all- it takes more than 5 seconds it take picture , you still get blurry picture horrible quality indoors . my sister camera olympus , 5 megapixel 3x zoom too , but i found it so much easier take picture(and better one too ) one . unless you want buy your 5th grader his/her toy camera , you shouldn't consider nikon 5600 .	-1
camera feels slick . software comes it gets 4 star efficiency , though intuitiveness not its strength . while large lcd display terrific ( main reason i got it ) , it worthless high glare situation . you can't see what you shooting . it worthless ! since nikon not give you viewing lense such situations , there times whey you no idea what you shooting . while viewing wheel , rapidly cycle through shots you've taken , quite handy , rest navigation less than intuitive , often takes so long figure out you give up . pictures generally good , though conditions perfect , or you get grain or blur . there one lovely feature , but it only useful tri-pod . it function which allows you take flash photo aperture remain open little while after fill background . it creates flash shots without black void background typical such pix . i use feature lot , but its worthless without " legs " camera . i bought this whim , counting nikon reputation . i known , i would stuck canon	-1
although easy load smart card , this viewer disappointing quality . my pictures look fine my computer , but pictures dark there no instruction how change contrast etc . ( although i found it picture could adjusted , it never mentioned manual ) . manual , because comment above , disgustingly incomplete . if not going through bother returning it through amazon because i purchased it line , i would not kept it . i actually bought digital frame smaller cheaper it worse , otherwise i would given it only one star . i could purchased unit circuit city or bestbuy better off	-1
this tripod seemed very nice ... until we tried extend legs all way . two half legs worked well , third section would not stay extended . locking devices pretty poor . they made cheap plastic i believe even ones work well now , not last very long even moderate use . next time i try find tripod set screw type leg extension lock	-1
battery lasts 10 minutes even full charge . i made mistake buying two them my husband dvd player they useless . what waste my money	-1

quite sometime lured media publicity i thought sony good brand . but this not all true digital cameras . i bought this p73 myself hp 4 mp camera my cousin much cheaper than sony . both 3x optical zoom . hp one far better image quality . main problem photo quality not so good . it lacks sharpness most natural occassions becomes bit hazy . this fact becomes annoying because your friend who cannon or hp camera take sharper pictures better than you any light conditions . also , same price you might look something higher than 3x optical zoom , say 5x or so other brands . also during video , every option adjusting light conditions etc shut off , irritating fact . not recommended	-1
camera takes long time pictures regenerate next picture . compared other digital camera this presented problem two users i purchased these camera . also flash not adjust correct exposure protraits within 3 5 feet . pictures too hot , over exposed no adjustment works properly .	-1
horrible camera . barely it 2 months before it went fritz . drained batteries within few pictures . so not worth more then cost disposable !! sorry kodak ... but i'll stick good ol ' reliable sony	-1
i agree two previous reviewers . there needs user manual there isn't one . fine adjustment adjust vertical angle maybe 15 degrees . this isn't very helpful star gazing . maximum height tripod only 45 inches . this uncomfortable height looking through binoculars while standing . celestron should users guide showing how their tripod binoculars supposed work together	-1
i just got this printer dock camera , printer feature real pain ! paper almost never feed no matter what i've tried . when it feed , it ends up jamming . i only successfully printed one picture tried 7 others then laminate gone . i'm very unhappy it probably send it back	-1
i tried everything . firewire , usb . there insert guide mentioned you connect cable first your pc then your camera , then turn pc then turn camera ... then wait stars align right order . if you anything different order then your camera get damaged . what kind crazy world panasonic live ? well , i followed instructions tee , downloded right drivers all yet my pc not recognize gs19 or gs9 . i used both . gs19 new purchase so this definitely going back . i thought , this model would gone away kinks but , no ! so , my panasonic recorded dvs gonna remain tape . i never able put them dvds . what joke , this camera turned out	-1
this case looks good protects camera adequately , but too bulky . it hasn't got lot room inside - i unable fit extra sd card its little case spare battery . belt clip difficult use , i end up carrying case my hand most time . there better cases this camera	-1
i've read good reviews this camera this other sites but i am not same experience . quality photos horrible so i started thinking it me i tried it different settings , tried very , very still etc but , i only get one good shot out ten . i fuji 4mp i bought 6 years ago it takes way better pictures than this . i bought this so i could give my old one my daughter but i'm gonna end up giving this one my daughter keeping my fuji . we recently snow here tucson so i took pictures mu fuji compares them canon 6 year old fuji finepix beat it hands down . i don't get it , i get defective camera or am i doing something wrong or this camera just suck	-1
night owl optics monocular major flaw soon i started using it . system uses high voltage derived 2-aa bateries . occationally unit would create large snap(arcing noise ) emit bright flash light eyepiece . if one using instrument , light actually hurts eye . i returned monocular night owl repairs . i not know result repairs it still transit . they told me ship it my expense . strange requirement instrument batteries recommended removed if not used 24 hours . other than above , monocular performed well . epilogue-night owl optics repair unit returned it .	-1
it arrived broken stand missing . i waiting replace it local discovery store	-1
i received this monitor baby shower gift , but it something i particularly wanted . i extremely disappointed when i found it didn't work all ! there so much sound interference it impossible tell if noises baby or interference . we disconnected every electronic appliance house ( cordless phone , microwave , even turned off our cell phones ) still interference there . video reception awful , supposed up 300 feet , we only roughly 20 feet away still picture terrible . i swear it supposed " night vision " - forget it , non-existent . i'm off video monitoring ; i'm on-line now buy old-fashioned voice monitor	-1
it fits s1 , but it doesn't always charge -- contacts arent same size oem version . when it doesn't charge i just re-insert batter it works , but its sort bummer	-1
i just bought this camera took it one my kid indoor soccer games . light low , but not low . you should able take picture without flash . when i took flash off , picture looked fine preview , but came out completely black . yet camera able take perfectly fine video same light level ! what disappointment . i am going try return it	-1
careful ordering this item - make sure it right one your camera . while it says it a95 , it isn't . while it doesn't say header it la-dc52c , it , a95 camera requires la-dc52d . i return wrong one reorder right one . i purchased wrong one based amazon direction when purchasing accessories don't want others make same mistake	-1
i own many sony products , including sony cybershot dsc-f717 , which i love . however , i am very disappointed this camera , sony cybershot dsc-t5 . i bought t5 my mother father present . it small , lightweight , portable ; easy use ; stylish . it take nice photos brightly lit environments , especially outside . however , after several months use , few problems become consistently evident : ( 1 ) there horrible red-eye ( white-eye ) artifact many pictures . so-called " red-eye reduction " setting nothing . ( 2 ) dim-light photography very grainy , lots noise . nigh t-t ime photography impossible . these problems not unique our camera ... you find many corroborating reviews above . overall , i am very disappointed this camera , wish i could exchange it something else . not buy this camera . other reviewers suggest t7 or t9 take much better pictures ( they still small pocket-size cameras ) .	-1
this lens extremely fast ( quiet ) focus , razor sharp . what more could you want , when photographing wildlife up close	1
i purchased this lens back march 2005 shoot static " warhammer models " my 10d . i found longer lenses such sigma 105mm , canon ef 100mm , tamron sp autofocus 90mm all " too long " 10d 1.6 focal crop would result requiring me use lot more physical space what i room get sho t.t he canon ef 50mm f/ 2.5 nearly perfect match 10d this purpose . its small , its compact , its short focal length not require i standing three feet away model i'm shooting . far shooting non-static objects , such insects , lens slow focus loud , both noise vibration , which results " startled " subjects missed shots . same also applies non-macro shots well . its slow focus makes it poor choice action photography , its loud enough draw attention you when you attempting other shots well	-1
it everything it advertised . i carry my digital camera lenses well two point shoot digital cameras . slingshot backpack , my back doesn't moan groan it other camera bags . i like feature swinging bag front get my cameras out removing backpack	1
i'm still learning use this camera all features . so far it amazing . i've taking pictures kids it looks like pro shots . i use auto mode lot it works great . zoom amazing . i love it tells me when i am focused . also it great battery life . i'm very happy this camera	1
this very easy use camera . simply using auto mode composing your pictures properly you get very good jpeg images . it also complicated you want make it . it many advanced features it . i shooting 35mm 32 years . my most recent before this one elan ii 7 years ago . it still working also . 30d my first digital i absolutely love camera . i generally work aperture priority mode tripod 100 iso when shooting landscape . but , camera very capable auto mode well without tripod . i like shoot raw so i tweek things bit , but jpeg images very acceptable . it also works extremely well portraits . it actually better than 35mm me because it very low noise even higher isos . 1600 looks like 800 film me . this very good value money my opinion	1
purchased printer dock camera bundle , local office supply store $100 . it only came 10 picture sample cartridge , so i purchsed this amazon . amazon best price around this item free shipping . it works great . no complaints . paper not quite shiny or thick epson photo glossy paper i still use some pictures , but works well my classroom , give my students . pictures not run like some inkjet pictures if you accidentally drip water them	-1
this one first lenses i purchased my rebel xt . now after taking several thousand pictures it i honestly say it well worth cost . i very rarely any unsharp pictures this lens unless it my own fault trying use too slow shutter speed without tripod . i also 180mm f/ 3.5 macro lens , which costs 3 times more than this lens , although it very clear extra reach nice times especially since it used both 1.4 2x tc , it very difficult use inside without tripod . 60mm handheld if needed very good results even if you bump your iso up little so . i also used this lens both inside outside portrait work very nice results . all-in-all , given it small size light weight i very rarely leave this lens behind when i go out because you never know when you might see great macro shot	1
my search semi pro digicam made me lot research after i shortlisted few models i find best deal . amazon helped me get deal today when i look performance camera so far .. i am amazed ... camera bound good but special thanks amazon.com helping me get one gr8 price	1
used this lens deer stand while hunting , sporting events ( indoor outdoor ) concerts . fast focusing great image stabilization ( use quite bit more power , though ) . not one problem it . solid build little heft it . it bit pricey , but i chaulk up it best market . would recommend it anyone looking top shelf lens .	1
i am very happy resulting prints this camera . i've used other brands past never such bright colors focus shots . winding mechanism easy use . finally i pictures my diving expeditions remember . it even suited kids over ten use . mine lots fun their own quick snap	1
short , i love it . xh a1 professional looking camera all features you need . it bit complex those who not true prosumers or pros , manual not consumer oriented . picture qualitity , so far , best i've seen non-pro cameras . 3 ccds 1/3 inch each truely spectacular . 2 external xlr connections reason i looked this camera . if you want mic someone via wireless or wired lav mic , this camer . just make sure you read over xlr connection settings manual few times change buttons ( unfortunately located 4 different locations camera ) right settings . set good headphones must-have when not using wonderful built-in mic . way , this built-in mic eliminated one situations where i always needed mic , close up interview situation -- built-in very sensitive accurate this type thing . downside this camera really only it not contain hdmi adapter . sadly canon not provide one ; instead they opted custom ( hdmi-looking ) adpater if you loose cable you can't run down fry or radio shack get one . :( other thing it 1440x1080 instead 1920x1080 . their new canon hv20 ( 1ccd camera due april 2007 ) 1920x1080 resolution -- just seems odd me . but then i'm guy get 10 megapixel camera simply because its better resolution . :) bottom line , don't get sony fx7 , get this one . sony seems easier use , but it doesn't external xlr jack , it uses 1/4 inch ccds , side-by-side test doesn't offer good performance low light situations this one . camera bit complicated , but if you're willing learn , it wonderful tool . if you need true point shoot , i'd wait get canon hv20	-1
i bought this camera take pictures my family friends . i if more than one year , it performed above expectations under all conditions . 1 minute video feature great , unexpected bonus ( since i didn't know it when i bought it off amazon ) . camera works great iphoto macos . i bought 512 mb card it so far it great . both my father my father law previous powershot s400 they no problems it . i figure some point i'll change battery , because lithium-ions lose 20% capacity per year , but so far it worked flawlessly .	1
i really some research digital cameras , even tried out sony , but canon brand far one best . i don't lot thinking when snapping picture this camera , it most work ! i like able think compostion my photo not iso , aperature , all jazz . settings make it so easy color photos turn out so true . digital zoom great even alert you if picture come out blurry . there so many features this camera , too many list . i even found great deal best buy 2 gig memory card , i get over 1,000 photos high resolution ! it takes alkaline batteries , but i bought rechargeable ones one charge lasts long time . i am sooo happy this camera , i take it me everywhere , even couple days work .	1
you check photos i took canon s45 this housing . it works brilliant . i just tested 10meters . also there supported extra lenses this housing ( macro , wide ) ..	1

through most 1990s , i lived overseas both europe asia . unfortunately , my number photos these times limited handful i hated looking like " tourist " my bulky camera ! nowadays , i no longer worry because cameras like this one ! i intially bought this t7 after using friend t1 impressed size it . t7 obviously considerably smaller , which even better ! i bought this camera right they coming out paid well over $400 it plus 1gb memory stick pro . both investments even this day ( over year later ) i am very happy . i taken this camera just everywhere wherever i go people love look it . i say i've probably sold least dozen these people fell love size camera quality photos it takes . far size , biggest plus it advantage . it fit anywhere . even optional case you buy it , it still easily fits trouser or jacket pocket , without even noticable bulge . far photo quality goes , most reviews note , camera very limited when it comes night time shots . i've found these shots often hit miss far what you'll get , but size lens size flash , what you expect ? after shooting few thousand photos this camera , i know what good bad night shot , playback feature , you quickly see quality your photo retake if needed . it perfect ? no , but that super tough camera this small . some reviews note difficulty trying take photo while holding camera still . i've never issue this , but i could see how it could issue , it just never one either my wife ( primary user ) or i dealt . i would venture probably vast majority buyers this camera likewise not problem . i've recorded more than few . mpg movies camera it surprisingly outperformed some my bigger ( more expensive ) point-and-shoot digital cameras . i very pleased . drawback noted many reviews lcd screen chance breaking it . i put plastic screen protector ( thin plastic sheet type held static ) it soon i bought it haven't problem . i've sat camera before ( accident , course ! ) it luggage like , but never problem . most significant drawback i've camera it take more photos ( esp 1gb card ) than battery last . buy second battery you'll more than good , but it just something keep mind . i would highly recommend this camera anyone who travels , or anyone who wants camera take quick photos . it carried anywhere vast majority shots , it all you need . i say we many photos our kids ( really good ones , too ) we would never gotten if my wife didn't regularly carry this camera her purse diaper bag ! i'm happy enough it i'm going buy second one myself ( especially now prices dropped so much ! ) so my wife use our first one entirely her own photography . i give it five stars would definately recommend it others	1

i received this camera serveral weeks . it good long zoom digital camera . i use it 18x optical zoom when i set its photo size less than 3m ez . photo isn't blur i use image stabilized . picture sharp . image quality good . however i set iso 100 or 200 . when iso 400 or above , i see noise , picture lose detail . but every camera its own defect . overall , i am satified this camera , i am enjoying using it take pictures .	1
i would like add reviews already posted , especially anyone considering this lens alternative 80-400 vr . this one only times i remember when i money buy nikon lens , but not able bring myself it . 80-400 6 years old , uses ancient mechanical ( slow ) focus , yet updated vrii technology . all , it still costs more than pro-quality canon 100-400 , which canon af-s equivalent too ! said , i like long yet portable lenses , after giving myself fits decided " settle " 70-300 because it vrii af-s . if you same boat then buy this lens , it gem its intended purpose . i get sharp results wide open 300 , light weight more than offsets slower apertures . i would loved this lens if it f/ 3.5 , but even 4.5 - 5.6 i really surprised results . save $1000+ until nikon updates 80-400 dinosaur	-1
this diffuser same quality one comes nikon sb 800 flash . it much better than other aftermarket diffusers require velcro . this made fit sb 600 perfectly . it snaps off easily . angled 75 degrees it provides excellent fill . i use it sb 600 set up slave sb 800 fill back lighting . it should included nikon original equipment but inexpensive cost effective . much better than built plastic flat diffuser	1
this camera very very easy use . i amazed colour quality even very low light . i took movie my nephew theater play i am contrasts crispness picture just perfect . zoom also very clear crisp . putting it onto my imovie also piece cake . only down point still image mode worthless , but if you need you should buy next level up which memory card slot . i highly recommend this camer	1
if you looking good small camera , no intentions ansel adams , this good camera choice . i travel alot , this camera perfect because it fit my pockets or small purse . it also takes pretty good pictures	-1
this backpack very uncomfortable . inserts stiff . it doesn't represent canon quality ( i hope )	-1
this great range use every day walk around lens . it very versatile , light produces great image sharpness throughout range . there bit vignetting wide end , which i actually like . however , f4 , this lens simply not fast enough me . i shoot lot images where i want out focus areas ( bokeh ) glassy smooth ( weddings , portraits such ) you cannot get this lens good you 24-70 2.8 . 24-105 f4 lens image stabilization which help you hand hold get shot lower light situations , but there not much get super smooth bokeh it . if you zoom all way , your dof low pretty darn smooth though my case , i just prefer look bokeh 24-70 overall rather than this lens . although 24-70 super heavy weight compared 24-105 . but i'm professional photographer so while my needs likes geared towards preferring 24-70 2.8 , this doesn't mean 24-105 isn't ideal many if not most .	-1
not much add top other reviews . only thing you should aware depth field f/ 1.8 paper thin , which excellent portraits , but requires perfect focussing . bokeh ( structure background blur ) nothing short great , easily competing much more expensive lenses . yes , it " " quality	1
i somewhat surprised receive my tc80n3 only canon international warranty .... anyone else receive grey market version this remote control ? i ordered $1000s canon products amazon.com always received canon usa warranty card items .... not sure why this item didn't carry usa warranty . i sent several emails amazon.com regarding this matter . i'll update review when i receive answer satisfactory . please note : amazon shipping replacement remote ! i'll amend again once replacement received . control itself wonderful product but this price i expect canon usa warranty card . gar	1
this great lens if you need shoot wide angle very low light siuations . if you don't need lens this exact purpose , you'd better off spending few extra dollars either 16-35l or 24-70l . these two zoom lenses cover 24mm ( more ) very reasonable 2.8 good results . they won't bag shot shadows , but they handle any decently lit scenario ease . if you just own 1.4 prime lens , 35mm 1.4 much more universally well-regarded lens than 24mm 1.4 . 50mm 1.4 1/3 price either just amazing my opinion so long you don't need wide angle . only reason i give 24mm 1.4 4 instead 5 price	-1
got it . worked per described . value money . works both front behind rabel xt(somebody wrote here it doesn't work back side camera )	1
my kids competitive tae kwon . i now used camera my wife gave me one year ago several tournaments . it able stop action take great shots even low lighting . now , we tried it when we went skiing it also worked great glare conditions snow . i bought monopod worked real well stabalize i use software called photofinale crop share photos . one year into usage i am still looking forward each chance i get play this " toy " . next options : battery grip , flash diffuser , extra remote flash ..	1
i spend most my time photographer taking macro photographs flowers other small things nature . i chose this lens over canon 50mm macro 100mm macro two reasons : ( 1 ) it constructed higher quality ud glass , so it great color contrast , it incredibly sharp all f/stops , ( 2 ) 180mm , it allows you stay farther away your subjects still focus 1:1 . this makes it easier take photographs without disturbing your subjects it allows you smaller , more blurry area background so background doesn't compete subject attention . lens also comes tripod color , which allows you conveniently change vertical horizontal , it adds stability your lens better balanced your tripod . lens ultrasonic motor , so it fast quiet when focusing , though i highly recommend setting focus limiter 1.5 m-infinity when not shooting macro photography . it speed up time it takes lens focus . only drawback i find lens it constructed only 8 blade aperture diaphram . theoretically , higher number blades , it would allow more natural blurs , but i say i've never noticed problem my photographs	1
i spent alot time evaluating this product . finally after reading reviews i dug deep spent extra dollars get this lense . it wounderful addition my canon reble . it very high quality product easy use delivers beautiful shot every time .	1
this lens takes very sharp pics . works great low light . true value price	1
great company - delivered product time . tested out lens mexico , brazil , canada . when automatic settings camera ( canon 10d ) selected pictures taken outdoors lot daylight , background overexposed . this results things like clouds not included picture . manual settings adjustments within camera remedy problem . however , there expectation lens canon should take quality pictures automatic setting . otherwise lens works great	-1
this camera pretty good , it very fast , photo quality excellent , video recording mode awesome , perfect carry everywhere since it pretty small , but after several months normal use , metal case begins look pretty rusted , that why i dont give this camera 5 star rating . but check flickr photos , you see examples great photo quality camera	-1
i originally purchased 30d low-end kit lens - me pricing didn't really make sense get either body or higher-end kit lens . i looking good all-purpose zoom full-size sensor covereage case i move up canon ranks new pro-level model future . 28-135 fits bill nicely . although it fairly heavy , difference build image quality 18-55 kit lens incomparable . this lens takes beautiful pictures operates flawlessly . i highly recommend it day-to-day lens , nice feature extending range down few stops without moving up much more expensive faster lenses	1
i love ef 70-200 f/4l usm telephoto zoom lens . price right , super quality pictures color contrast . it light weight 1.5 pounds comparing its siblings , 70-200 f/ 2.8 or without ( 3.5 pounds ) . i am think buy new model 70-200 f/4l . , i take pictures lower light conditions , which i could not it my 70-200 f/4l .	1
i like picture quality features this camera this price point so much , its third one i've purchased . my family seems hard cameras such this model only seems last year or so . point its banged around my wifes purse or accidentally dropped kids telescoping mechanism lens stops working . doing web research it seems common problem . so if you're typically more gentle than me my family seem , this great easy picture taker	-1
i this bag now over 9 months honestly say it more then surpassed my expectations . it stores everything i need when out family or friends catch all action one convenient place . center bag i following : 1 . rebel xt body2 . canon 430ex flash3 . 17mm-85mm lens4 . 75mm-300mm lens5 . sony handycam video recorder6 . power plug charging video recorderon sides i store battery chargers batteries flash , camera video camera , plus tapes video camera . front holds all manuals everything few extra memory cards lens covers . even after this , there still space bag other things . bag held up very well see no signs wear or tear after dragging this bag all over place last 9 months .	1
i got this lens my 30d found it useful walkaround lens , able handle just any situation i threw it , other than very low-light situations . even dim illumination it able function fairly well , thanks image stabilization , which let me shoot shutter speeds slow 1/4 second hand-held . i wasn't thrilled barrel distortion wide end zoom range , but i able fix this using photoshop lens correction adjustment no problem . it simply additional post processing step that necessary	-1
excellent choice make great job .	1
d70s minor update original d70 introduced 2004 , few new features slightly larger lcd . it still great camera , but expect it replaced new d80 , which 40 percent more pixels , 2.5 -inch lcd , additional useful features old price d70s . so , you probably save little money still purchase sophisticated digital slr if you wait until prices d70s stabilize new , lower level . , say , $600 , this camera would incredible bargain . d70s shined one best cameras its class since its introduction . example , it 1/500th second flash synch speed ( found no other camera but d50 ) so you keep ambient light under control avoid ghost images . its autofocus fast accurate , features both single-autofocus , continuous-autofocus ( tracking action ) , novel " automatic " autofocus mode switches af-s af-c required . if you no nikon lenses , get this camera 18-70mm kit lens , which very sharp versatile , rather than more limited 18-55 lens . you won't regret it	1
sima monopod perfect if you're looking something easy carry set up . it exends quickly quick release mount stay attached camera base . stability good , but it not sturdy feel . if you want something solid feel , you move up food chain , but sacrifice compactness light weight this product .	-1
great case . small , soft , compact , extra space batteries . however , hole camera strap center , which means if your camera strap attaches anywhere other than middle camera , it doesn't line up this case . minor detail . example , strap a530 near top camera , so strap goes out side case , unless you pull it sideways go through case hole .	-1
i bought this little camera recently amazon . thanks tremendous service speedy delivery , amazon . sony dsc-w100 terrific . it very simple operate . menu system well-organized easy understand . inserting battery memory card snap . zeiss lens system yields incredibly sharp photos even automatic setting . flash pretty powerful , too ! i took some shots rather dark restaurant , pictures came out really nice clear . macro function superb crisp , well-defined details very close range . powerup time this camera fast well time shots . there very little shutter lag , you usually get picture you intended get . autofocus little slower until it " finds " target perfectly certain situations . but this no big deal compared older digicams . i like able switch quickly viewing pictures replay mode back camera mode simply tapping shutter release button lightly . you quickly ready picture . camera not miniature weighs nearly six ounces , which not extremely light -- but comfortable carry or place purse or pocket . i also canon digital rebel xt , this little camera take sharper pictures . course , you not versatility slr , but it great everyday camera take you all shots you would otherwise miss . i highly recommend this camera recommend purchase amazon . update : i now used this camera video mode . wow . it produces incredibly sharp videos fast frame rate looks terrific our television . multi-purpose cable supplied camera allows usb 2.0 audio/video hookup . you must decide what zoom level before you start shooting your video because once you start , you cannot zoom out . if you 1 gb memory stick pro duo you take 12 minutes video . i want get 2 gb pro duo stick which allows almost 25 minutes video . this would ideal take when you want switch still video shots keep your video shots consistent consecutive order . you must use pro duo stick high quality ( fine ) video mode	1
bought this remote month ago . it what it says . you even use it behind . great little device price	1
i've considered other , higher priced digital slrs , such nikon d80 canon 30d . however , i decided i probably won't using some more advanced features offered those cameras , would rather spend money saved better lens . terms picture quality , all these slrs capable equivalent quality . currently i 3 lenses , kit 18-55mm , 50mm f/ 1.8 , 85mm f/ 1.8 . i don't use kit zoom lens anymore because i favor faster , prime lenses . i mostly take pictures my children , 85mm f/ 1.8 excellent portrait lens . it sharp , fast , produces beautiful background blur . zoom lenses unfortunately not sharp or fast , unless you're willing pay much more than cost camera body . i think all novice slr owners should buy cheap canon 50mm f/ 1.8 , discover what fast lens when you set aperture 1.8 , take some portraits . you too professional-looking results	1
i've this battery 3 months . so i don't long term experience . but so far it excellent . no better or worse then original canon battery . i would reccomend it anyone .	1
i 5 digital point shoot cameras all little bigger better than last . this my first slr i am not least disappointed . this camera meets or exceeded everything i expected it . very easy learn , read manual use web site tuturial when battery charged your ready go take pictures . i highly recommend this camera	1
my search semi pro digicam made me lot research after i shortlisted few models i find best deal . amazon helped me get deal today when i look performance camera so far .. i am amazed ... camera bound good but special thanks amazon.com helping me get one gr8 price	1
i bought canon powershot s2 year ago , taken 2,500 photos 15 video clips it . overall , i am very happy it , if i buying new camera today , i probably would get s2 or s3 . things i like s2 : * extended zoom ( 12x ) . i use it often . * image stabilization . particularly helpful when using high zoom factor , or when shooting low light low iso setting . it makes handheld shots slow shutter speeds possible . * electronic viewfinder means " what you see what you get " , just like slr . while not sharp optical viewfinder , ability frame picture without worrying parallax more than makes up it . fact , one advantage over slr there no mirror it move out way , therefore there no mirror noise when taking picture ; if you turn off electronic sound effects , it very quiet indeed ( although not completely silent ) . * screen moves rotates . i like it closed ( turned toward camera ) thus protected scratches . i used it folded out rotated forward order see myself self-timer photo . i used it take " clandestine " pictures -- holding camera down near my waist , i still see screen if i rotate it towards me . i also used it take pictures while holding camera above my head -- above crowd , instance , or over wall . * multiple-picture mode . similar motor drive film cameras , this allows me take several pictures quick succession holding down shutter release button -- 2 pictures per second . unlike some cameras , only limit number pictures amount available memory . * it used all-automatic mode , all-manual mode , or just any combination . even near-automatic mode , several exposure settings adjusted . * very good movie mode . it shoot vga-quality picture ( 640x480 ) 30fps . while results not good my 3-ccd dv video camera , i am much more likely this camera me than video camera , i really like option taking reasonably high quality video . i used it several times . * stereo microphones . decent sound video . also used adding sound memo still picture ( e.g. " this such-and-such place , blah blah blah " ) , or just recording sounds unrelated any picture . i used this couple times record " sound memory " place ; one botanical garden spot where scenery wasn't especially pretty , but sounds frogs made like nothing we heard before ! * separate buttons still pictures movies . easy remember which which . * manual pop-up flash . some people don't like flash doesn't pop up automatically when needed . i actually like this feature , because often i want shoot without flash when camera thinks i need use flash . course i force flash fire even bright daylight when camera thinks it not necessary -- although while i kept forgetting how turn feature , even though it pretty obvious ( there button right next flash ! ) . things i don't like it : * poor low-light performance . more precisely , poor performance high iso settings . camera fine low light if you leave shutter open long enough , or use flash . but if you kick up iso 200 or 400 ( equivalent " fast " film ) so you take indoor shots without flash , you end up very noticeable graininess pictures . this my number one disappointment camera . however , i don't know comparable camera better ( sample pictures i seen , s3 isn't any better ; i don't know why they bothered add iso 800 setting -- it seems completely useless me ) . i know there cameras , but they cost lot more . i saw pictures taken indoors canon 20d slr phenomenal . but besides added expense , camera like also bigger heavier , therefore less convenient . * camera too big pocket . i would love camera capable this would fit my shirt pocket , or least my coat pocket or smallish holster . i would take it more places if it wasn't so big . * yet , same time , it little too small my hand . grip just doesn't feel right . grip 20d felt great ! however , it just right woman hand -- my wife likes it fine . * no filter threads standard configuration . big lens like practically begging fingerprints or scratches . i solved adding conversion lens adapter , which filter threads ( more this below ) . * lens cap held friction . this both pro con . it good because lens extends when camera turned ; if lens cap attached lens simply push it off . it bad because cap could come off when you don't want it . this moot point conversion lens adapter , standard lens cap no longer fit . * default exposure too bright . not every review mentions this , but apparently it fairly common canon cameras . fortunately , this easily fixed setting exposure adjustment ( i set mine -2/3 stop ) . i haven't figured out how adjust exposure movies , though . i need look manual see if it possible ! if you buy s2 ( or s3 ) , i'd suggest also considering : * canon lah-dc20 lens adapter hood set . i mentioned above , this allows you add filter protect lens . currently $37.10 amazon . * 58mm skylight or uv filter screw lens adapter . * 58mm lens cap cover adapter/filter . canon 58mm snap-on lens cap currently $9.99 amazon . * high-speed sd card , least 512mb , but 1gb or 2gb would give more space movies . ( i use sandisk ultra ii plus , which added benefit able directly plug into standard usb port without adapter . ) * rechargeable nimh batteries . i don't any yet , but this next thing my list . i've gone through way too many aa batteries ! nice option available this camera tc-dc58b tele converter lens . this gives you maximum zoom equivalent 648mm 35mm camera . amazing ! i not purchased it yet because so far built-in zoom sufficient my needs . there also wc-dc58a wide converter lens taking extra-wide-angle pictures . after you get camera , you'll probably want case some type it . there * lots * cases choose . after trying few looking lot more , i finally settled tamrac velocity 4 . it may or may not what you need case , but there it fyi	-1
i used this sb-600 my fuji s3 digital camera friend wedding . i found you need diffuser ( such omni bounce ) , otherwise you get shadows . it works great bouncing off ceiling fill whole room . this flash easy use , reliable batteries didn't die until picture #637 . i no instances it not going off when i took picture ever	1
i owned this camera two months now taken 100 photographs ( keepers ) date . because i involved photography almost 35 years , i developed certain prejudices . particular , i never comfortable auto exposure even less comfortable auto focus . fact , last auto focus camera i owned nikon n8008s i ultimately sold auction because i could not adapt using various auto settings . however , i like this camera . why ? d70s very easy camera use i only refer manual check couple settings look up some features . honestly , set up takes only few minutes handling not terribly different film camera . i should point out this camera really designed auto focus lenses if you choose use your manual focus lot , you disable many camera features . because i am both stubborn cheap ( but mostly only when it comes spending money myself ) i am using my manual focus lenses this camera . it true i not get any internal exposure meter readings must rely handheld gossen or sunny 16 rule ( quite effective , really ) exposure determination . lcd preview screen thus critical determining or adjusting exposure . i should also point out depth field preview feature also lost when using manual focus lenses . i stunned when i could not stop my lens down burrowed through manual find out what i doing wrong -- which nothing except i using wrong type lens . while i really miss this feature , i am not sure how big loss it really because viewfinder . others made mention low magnification tunnel like views through finder i attest this fact . i compared finder views my trusty old fm just stunned how poorly d70 compared . ultimately best camera camera you use d70 become my camera choice . even though i am using this camera like vintage series leica -- i.e. , handheld meter presetting exposure anticipation photograph -- i find i live this level usability . some point i probably buy auto focus lens ( maybe 35 f2 ) make full use feature set . but now i content using camera old fashioned way	-1
when hood reversed lens , it blocks zoom ring tremendously when 17mm . it not end world , but you're probably better off storing this bag , not lens itself when not use	-1
when i bought digital camera , i already knew i would need rechargeable batteries it . what i didn't realize how quickly camera would eat supplied alkalines . i taken barely dozen pictures before they drained point where camera would no longer operate ! so i looked set rechargeable batteries charger quickly settled this one because previous experience monster cable products . it performs better than advertised . initial charge may taken 3 hours , but subsequent charges much quicker . i yet drain these batteries point where they won't operate camera . charger itself attractive unit appliance , led indicator lights up red charging changes green indicate fully charged . it compact enough fit comfortably camera bag plug folds into back it . i good service it highly recommend this charger	1
this uv filter it job protect lens well . build solid ( metal construction ) . glass also descent quality . performance , it absorbs some uv light . uv light absorbtion hardly noticeable , probably sky 1-a haze filter version absorb more uv light than this lens which fine me . now , one problem which internal reflection . i've heard many people say it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out it not caused directly low light/night situation . internal reflection appear when there strong/bright source light comparison overall exposure ( surrounding environment ) . put it example ( which hopefully easier understand ) , when you take picture lamp during nightime light much brighter than surrounding area then you see internal reflection . you move position light closer sides/corner picture ( not center picture ) , internal reflection reduces finally dissapear ( if you move light far enough center ) . if light isn't too bright/contrast compare surrounding environment then there no internal reflection . but course most time , lamp nightime often very bright . but point i'm trying make internal reflection doesn't happen all time during low light or night time . additionally , internal reflection isn't only happening night . it also happen afternoon if you taking picture sun example . basically same rule above , how bright light source compared surrounding area , you move sun center photo near side internal reflection move side/dissapear ( also depending angle ) . but best way just remove filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you reduce occurence internal reflection identifying correctly when internal reflection occur then remove filter during those situation ( which not hard ) . i'm actually not fan lens filter ( any filter ) i think it only degrade picture quality we added layer sensor object , but i decided use them anyway all my lens . i would recommend everyone get one this filter if you don't any filter your lens yet . i use this filter my 50mm f/ 1.8 lens my 18-55mm lens .	-1
if your camera spends any amount time connected your computer -- either copying pictures , or using remote capture program -- you should this ac adapter . it also obviously handy if you lot shooting fixed location -- instance : tripod . adaptor ingenious little contraption . there normal ac line runs power adapter , but instead running dc output dedicated jack camera body , connector shape normal battery pack . if you look closely your camera , you see little grove bottom battery compartment providing enough room wire exit . now surprise . i'm planning trip europe . i knew battery charger came camera , this ac adapter both support 100-240 volts ac , 50-60 hz input . which covers all worlds power supplies . but battery charger included camera only came us power cord . i've looking various european cords would fit charger so i could keep my batteries topped off overseas . what should i find when i open box this adaptor ? complete collection all worlds cords , which also happen fit charger . what win , now i run my camera ac , stay charged while i'm vacation	1
i own this hood canon digital rebel xt . i like hood . it works well limiting stray light well protecting lens . you hear many experienced photographers ( i'm amateur ) , they would never shoot pictures without hood lens so why would you ? all hoods expensive what they , piece plastic , but they serve necessary function . get hood if you want best your lenses , including this lens 50mm 1.8 ii . i would give it 5 stars but it pricey	-1

hoods offer several benefits photographer . primarily hood shades lens stray light may result unwanted discoloration or hazing image , or appearance lens flare . shading your lens helps improve contrast image quality . hood not required eliminate these problems , any item used shade lens provide same protection stray light . hood convenient it built offer protection while ensuring it not inadvertently find its way into your image . photographers often state protective abilities hood reason one . this hood solid petal shaped one three quarters inch long offers limited protection keeping moisture wind blown debris off lens element . when place , hood protect lens impacting solid objects . so shallow petal shaped , even this type protection limited . even if protection limited , replacing damaged hood usually cheaper than repairing expensive lens . this hood manufactured canon 24-105mm f/ 4.0 ef normally comes included lens when sold new . there no need buy one amazon often suggests . since hood wider than lens ; it easily stored attached reverse position . this doesn't add length lens , but make it wider inch . inch may not seem like lot , but tightly packed camera bag , it huge . this lens isn't unusually wide so extra inch may not problem . while protective benefits exist , they secondary limited . i find impact hood my image quality more convincing reason use hood . considering impact image quality low cost compared my other camera equipment ( except lens case ) , purchasing hood money well spent . pros : improves contrast image qualityreduces lens flare problemsoffers limited protection lens cons : takes up more space your camera bag store lenshigh price molded piece plasti	-1
very convenient . easy use . paper cartridge matched up quantities smart idea . sometimes printer jams but easy clear . i find colors bit dark skin tones not balanced most attractive . if they work these items this would fantastic device i would probably keep several office , home , garage , travel ... use lot media cartridges too . i am one those takes 800-1000 pictures two week vacation so i really would use heck out these cartridges if image quality better . i usually make 3 or 4 copies each print mail friends pictures	-1
i almost didn't buy this camera simply because plastic body ( i'm used praktica mtl3 film camera , which built like tank ) . however , i'm glad i overlooked because camera top-notch terms robust features quality it provides . startup time very quick making adjustments shutter speed aperture intuitive . if you get bundle kit lens , i highly recommend complimenting it very affordable canon ef 50mm f/ 1.8 ii lens , especially if you big fan dof lot available-light / low-light photography .	1

i bought this camera same reason many you considering it , or already bought it--it size . it amazingly small , it hard believe all packed into this camera . i take it me everywhere , literally , it so small i am able keep it my pocket , i don't fear it get ruined my pocket because it so durable . there also small covering lens , so you need not worry lens get scratched . picture quality surprised me , when i first saw this camera i saw how small it instantly assumed picture quality would not good -- but i wrong ! picture quality this camera outstanding ( taking its ' size price into consideration ) . however , i few things complain ... first off , battery . this camera uses lithium battery , i find lithium batteries highly inconvenient ; because what if you vacation , where nearest place buy batteries just gas station -- there no way you going find lithium batteries there . not only it inconvenient , but also battery life span short . longest i've it work 1 hour 45 minutes . this isn't uncommon cameras , though , just long you bring your charger spare batteries , you should fine . problem i this camera zoom function . such small zoom length you would think zoom would silent since it hardly zooms ... wrong ! very wrong . zoom function this camera so loud sometimes you unable use it if you find yourself situation where you must quiet . even just turning camera move lens little , resulting noisy start-up . flash very weak . really dissapointing . if you inside , you can't any farther away then 10 feet lit room . last problem i found this camera macro function . auto-focus camera seems trouble focusing subject . make matters work , there no manual override overcome this problem . focus great , though , if you not taking macro sho t.t hese all flaws i found camera , it not my first choice cameras , i come across many other beginner cameras i prefer over this camera , but thing you keep mind this camera size . if you just looking something keep you all times , then this great camera choice .	-1

if you use this lens 1.6 camera body such xt , 20d , or 30d you end up 160-640mm equivalent which impressive range any standard . you also add 1.4 tc 896mm upper limit or 2x tc amazing 1280mm . course this comes price , i'm not just talking money . you use tripod , cable release , mirror lockup lot time when using such long focal lengths . plus this thing very heavy very large people take notice . so if stealth photography your goal , go something like 70-300 . said , this amazing lens , admittedly little slow near long end , but get down f/4 would most likely doubled or tripled price weight , so it seems like acceptable trade-off . if you want sharp pictures , amazing zoom range , good workout , but don't mind center attention , this lens you	1
this one best bargains i've seen , " essentially " you get 3 filters price one . image quality these filters great , 812 ( warming ) filter far favorite giving back color richness flash photography so often washes out , unless you patience constantly tweaking your flash power . aside 812 uv protector basically clear protective filter . while it obviously advantages over clear glass , i tend not think it any different . this too great filter which i use half time because it doesn't affect color hues or change stop values too greatly while it takes worry out carrying camera around ready any candid shots may occur . finally included circular polarizer . this filter adjusts amount uv light entering camera spinning filter direction uv rays entering ( or turning thingy till things look better ) . this lens great sunny days take surface glare off lakes glass making them transparent again . it also makes colors more crisp general when photographing buildings other large " reflective " man-made things . so things sound great so far , but now why i only give this item 4 stars . while tiffen known one best photo video filters , they quality control issues no live up thier reputation . my case 812 filter arrived discoloration glass . while it didn't hurt image quality , flaw towards edge filter , i none less didn't want find situation which flaw would diminish quality . seeing it not amazon fault my first e-mail went tiffen replacement which they said they would gladly , but only after i send them filter they recieve it would they ship my replacement ( not option my circumstances ) . instead amazon wonderful customer service shown through again , within 3 days they replaced entire set . second set arrivided without flaw but since my other two filters perfect condition i traded just 812 . i havn't any other issues i'm very satisfied my filters . only other word warning would circular polorizer . while i recieved 2 flawless occassionally i read reviews customers received ones assembled backwards making lens useless . quick way check see if your cp working correctly hold it , thread facing yourself , look lcd monitor or tv spin it until picture dissapears(obviously working correctly ) . i still wouldn't pass up this deal knowing what i now , chances everything show up perfectly but none less if you're concerned order it before you need it check everything over carefully . amazon always best returns often ship replacement next day overnight shipping	-1

it seems unfair compare this camera 10d ( or 20d or 30d ) , either favorably or unfavorably . these instruments good their own right , but hardly same league 1ds mark ii . i used all three xxd , original 1ds body well . it occurs me folks who interested shelling out over 5 grand camera already idea what they want , some them asking if they should trade their 1ds body mark ii . it them i am adressing this review . remarks , i think help those who less experience line . bear me technical jargon emphais mark i vs ii comparison . i want help buyer decide if there really reason spend this kind money . first , regarding resolution : you probably won't able tell difference mark i mark ii unless you doing studio work . 8x10 image virtually indistinguishable . most us shoot . jpg mode , we don't mess raw . if you doing 17x20 wedding portrait working uncompressed files , mark ii superior . i outdoor work , so 11.6 megapixels plenty . finallyl , quality glass makes big difference ( much more than sensor resolution ) , so if you little strapped cash , buy 5d spend difference " " series lenses , or used 1ds ( mark i ) . second : ergonomics . i like histogram mark ii better than older camera , appreciate improved burst performance , storage times . small but significant differences . battery life way better , i like . i get 700 frames out charge mark ii only 200 mark ii . thank you , canon . maybe next iteration they something black brick charger . i only hope . third : sensor noise . most ofthe high-end cameras cmos now , each time we look new generation pictures we wowed decrease sensor noise high iso . i remember we praised mark i low noise up asa 400 . uninitiated , sensor noise random firing sensor due quantum effects , manifests sparkle or random changes pixel color . it more prominent low light high asa . mark i great up asa 400 , good up 800 needs some digital filtering 1200 . mark ii really good up asa 1600 , photoshop filter good 3200 . if you shoot low light , mark ii you . fourth : color balance . i always loved warm , saturated pictures mark i gives , so don't get me wrong - better color rendition not reason sell it new model . mark ii , though , improves it gives beautiful color saturation some improvement range highligts . digital photo buffs know what i mean : if you take picture broad highlights , like sky , foreground objecst underexposed . highlights clear . set exposrue foreground , sky burnt-out white . mark ii improved this much , but it still needs some work canon . now , it helps taken large number pictures get idea how set exposure . fifth : accuracy exposure . mark i annoying tendancy overexpose stop . i got used turning down exposure 1-2 stops , exposing highlights , using photoshop correct exposure . mark ii more accurate , manual exposure close metered exposure . sixth : ff/ 1.6 business . i really don't see any reason 30d better camera because 50mm lens gives image analagous 85mm lens full frame camera . advised , though , lens evaluations depend this distinction . edge performance flair may more obvious full frame instrument . both 1ds 1ds mark ii tend challenge lenses more because they work full range lens side side through apertures . my 35-135 canon lens gave great pictures 10d , but looks washed out both 1ds . before giving 1ds mark ii bum rap less than perfect pictures , ask what lens used . seventh : price . presently , non-grey-market 1ds mark ii sells around $6899 reputable dealers . used mark i around half . i would take half star away canon pounding my pocketbook taking , but i understand mark i just same price when it released . price gradient presently would tolerable those shooting low light , or raw studio work . personally , i would buy mark i over 5d improved construction . finally , some general remarks . i would liked compare this fine camera comparable nikon . unfortunately , i cannot , because all my glass canon , i no money left mul t-t housand buck purchase nikon . maybe someone else would write review . my only beefs canon sensor dust , seems appear spontaneous generation , steep learning curve i my first use . ( plan night or two reading manual ) i guess i forgive them not putting flash it . add couple hundred price purchase 580ex . canon service terrific . if you bucks , quit complaining price get one if you serious photographer . look images dpreview.com ( long , thoughtful review there ) , fredmiranda.com - they leave you breathless . this serious instrument serious photographers far it me give it less than 5 stars my petty complaints	1

after owning three other canon cameras i am through canon . all my other cameras fine . this cameras lcd broke within first month normal use . never dropped ! all my other digital cameras held up years . ive two powershot s50s 1 lost 1 stolen . never problem those both dropped numbers times . this product defect/design flaw canon not cover it under warranty . $150.00 get it repaired it happen again , or you may start getting e18 errors . this expensive paperweight ! poor design . very dissapointed . i never buy canon product again	-1
great flash , all good qualities sb800 but less data dump decision quagmire ! it built flash disperser , its lighter than 800 , so unless you're into more info than you need , go sb600 . oh , it shorter recycle time too .	1
this just plain sweetheart lens . it covers useful 18-35 mm range ( which 27-52mm nikon digital slr , which very useful range ) . this lens costs less than half price ( expensive ) professional nikon 17-35 , almost nice job . sufficiently nice , fact , most amateurs not discern much , if any , difference . while not built like tank , i think quality construction this one excellent , more than adequate enthusiastic amateurs even some pros . nikon digital slr , which use center portion this lens ( due size sensor slr ) you expect excellent , even spectacular results . this fabulous lens landscape nature shots , portraits , or just plain walking around taking pictures . someone who only wanted one lens not telephoto could much worse than select this excellent , versatile lens . this one great parties , vacations , works . images i shot this lens all featured superb contrast , very sharp , beautiful color rendition . there just not lot not like this lens . i give it 4 stars overall performance , but 5 stars value price/performance . some lenses just get it all together work become keepers . this one those	-1
i almost didn't buy this camera simply because plastic body ( i'm used praktica mtl3 film camera , which built like tank ) . however , i'm glad i overlooked because camera top-notch terms robust features quality it provides . startup time very quick making adjustments shutter speed aperture intuitive . if you get bundle kit lens , i highly recommend complimenting it very affordable canon ef 50mm f/ 1.8 ii lens , especially if you big fan dof lot available-light / low-light photography .	1
i wish i'd bought this loooong time ago ! it so helpful , esp . macro shots . highly recommend	1
leather , design , craftmanship all exceed my expectation . instead velcro , it replaced magnetic button , which plus . it also included matching leather wrist strap canon logo , plus . my canon sd40 also fit into nicely , although leave some room side	1
camera works great us so far ... we 3 year old digital camera so this upgrade better technology ... takes much better pictures than our old one ... video great ( except very low light ) ... we've taken lot short video clips our kids grandma ( etc ) ... nobody our family wants watch more than 5 minutes any one home video anyway ... so this camera saves us buy camcorder ... ( although our 1gb card we could take 45 minutes or so continuous video medium setting ) ... touch screen great simple ... camera quick response time indoor action pictures again great pictures our kids running around or birthday parties ... i took 92 minutes video 55 pictures ( plus sharing images videos others ) before battery ran out first time ( couple weeks shooting our family ) . i guess everyone their own needs when picking digital camera , but this one works great ours	1
i like this camera very much easy use gets good result	1
this lens provides best bang your buck ! build quality average , but optically it dream ! images this lens produces almost quality . not mention 1.8 such cheap lens . i've owned 2 these so far ( first died when it fell out my bag ) , if my 2nd ever dies , i'll buy ! it great both beginners pros	1
i tried this product out local camera store before i sold idea . two main things i concerned how it attach it add too much weight camera . attaching camera little concerning , i worried it may damage camera . but , after watching guy our local camera shop put one rebel i sold . basically you remove door battery compartment . which comes off lot easier than i anticipated . grip slides like battery you screw it bottom camera . don't worry their hole bottom grip tripod . grip add weight but its not significant i noticed it adds lot stability while holding it . since grip adds height camera its easier hold camera one hand . much like holding one more expensive models . it also adds battery life since grip holds two batteries . if you hold new grip take pictures camera its side . you pleasantly surprised see duplicate set buttons scroll wheel added new grip just purpose . it now permanent attachment i am glad i decided buy it . buttons work just well camera even 3fps . note quality canon grip much better than cheaper version .	1
yourself favor leave this camera its nuclear blast proof packaging . if you choose release it , you become proud owner " camera " whose most noteworthy attribute its ability drain batteries despite showing no other sign actually functioning . if you try load included software onto your computer , you left smoking remnant formally functioning hard drive require incredible luck or all computer expertise silicone valley recover . whatever you , don't expect get any help technical support phone number provided camera software . apparently , they overwhelmed customer complaints , advise calling back " later " assistance . fat chance . their camera destroyed itself , their software nearly destroyed my computer , i refuse give their telephone assistance chance take out my phone system . treat anything this company like it live virus . keep your kids , your computer yourself far , far away .	-1
i owned one previous models originally sold throughwallgreens returnable " one-time use " video camera . theory you didn't actually " own " camera . you would pay $30 it ; shoot some videos ; then return it store get dvd your videos . but course , people figured out how hack camera add usb cable download videos , so you didn't need return camera get videos . so this new psv-351 looks like " legit " model pure digitalcame out satisfy demand all people buying theolder models never returning them . smart move ! instead complaining , give pople what they want . if you can't beat ' em join ' em . even three times price what i paid my hacked versioni would easily buy legit one . i loved my hacked psv . i kept telling people " pure digitalshould sell these ! " it very simple camera . it doesn't tryto pretend more than it . it very few features . but what it it well . you push big red button it records good quality video ( quality impressive price ) . i'm big fan simple products work well -- like nintendo or ipod . this camera looks bit like toy , but it durable . this would actually make good toy kid or adult . ergonomics nice . it comfortable hold . quality construction very good . i like fact it runs two ordinary aa batteries , soyou don't need charger . i would buy one these -- or maybe even few them . buy bunch them pass them out wedding . duct tape one your motorcycle helmet . tie one kite	1
filters tiffen good quality filters . this pack filters provides one great range filters allow you extend your camera capabilties	1
i this camera work , job i should take 100+ pics day document my work . yes , this camera easy use takes decent pics . bad side : it eats batteries like crazy . worst part this camera after every 4-5 pics taken succession , " processing " graphic comes up lcd screen , i need wait 30-45 seconds before i take pic . 15 co-workers who given this camera well me , they experience same issue . once processing , majority times , it goes back processing after each image taken . this really annoying . i tried using one my personal hi speed sd cards instead dollar store sd card work supplied , same result . it makes no difference whether batteries new or used . if you wish take two or three pics , then shut camera down ... this would great inexpensive camera . i sure am glad i am clock when using this camera . my personal camera needs , i'd never accept this camera ... there would too many missed shots . i'll stick my panasonic lumix personal use	-1
this isn't sony-brand battery , but it works fine . remaining time shows camcorder display , just like it sony brand . i'm pleased , price great	1

it got seriously wet when canoe capsized , but kept going . not under water , just well into it . even actually submerged 70-300 lens came back life once it dried out .	1
charger small , it charges quickly . works great my spare batteries	1
coolpix p4 received lukewarm reviews when it released spring 2006 list price $399 , but you forget all . canada this camera retails something less than $300 now , makes it tremendous value . this camera features very solid aluminum body , large 1/ 1.8 " 8.1 mp sensor , excellent nikkor optics optical vr . it even very good macro mode . most importantly , it takes great photos . vr very effective : i taken clean handheld photos slow 1/4 second . even though it point shoot auto mode fairly reliable , p4 clearly aimed advanced user , because you really need know what you're doing if you want take full advantage its capabilities . i found i got my best indoor photos when i set exposure mode aperture priority , disabled flash used " pre " function white balance . if nothing else p4 great inexpensive , go-anywhere 2nd camera dslr owner	1
camera works general good especially times when bringing larger camera not feasible . i put this camera my pocket use it anytime . i love movie mode i shoot movie until storage space run out , can't my nikon d50 slr ! 2gb memory card it equals 16 minutes . video comes complete sound after burning dvd highest quality it looks clear visible large 50 " tv . i still like my nikon d50 slr better taking regular photos though . one reason slr snap photos quick it possibly shutter or flash only thing slow it down . problem p4 when compared d50 d50 focus instantly where p4 delay so when you're ready take photo d50 takes it no delay . this really useful when subjects moving you need capture them frame before they move off . many point shoot cameras , i've used , there too long delay take photo i've ended up half person or blurred image then good shot gone . p4 slight delay because it needs time focus it worse when camera flash charging low light situations . two inch display great , great previewing images . pictures i've taken so far sharp , rich color detailed . vibration reduction good feature because i've noticed it hard not shake camera just little bit when pressing down shutter button . i suppose there may not point shoot camera without delay , but this one better than most . digital slr still best camera , i think , not only its fast shooting ability but also its exceptional picture quality . so if you need camera portability compactness then nikon coolpix p4 great camera if you don't need such small camera then go slr camera which means : single lens reflex , if you don't already know means it basically means when you look though eyepiece camera you actual looking though lens , you see exactly how photo fit look . camera such nikon slr d50 one such example . if you money buy both , point shoot slr because each camera offers advantages over other .	-1
i'm not pro any means , but this camera fantastic . zoom really impressive clarity great ( again ... i'm not pro , just someone who loves take pictures ) . folks who complained detachable lens cap ... it really not big deal . there small strap packaged camera , which very simple attach , connect lens cap camera . same strap also attaches wrist strap camera	1

this well made battery pack adds some heft your cp8800 . wonderful camera , this battery pack adds your ability sty field longer . it takes least 300 pictures fully charged set nimh batteries . install , you take out li-lion battery twist off battery cover . don't lose this cover !! i put mine baggie stuffed it next my spare li-lion battery my camera bag . you then push pack into battery cavity screw bottom pin tripod place . it fits very neatly solidly . if you very close fitting camera bag , adding this unit may create problem , but otherwise it plus you . it fits nicely my hands if you find battery cavity cover , you now sources power . you choose which one you want back-up . now sold bh $149 , it much more reasonably priced	1
i bought this so we could get better look birds our backyard . we keep it kitchen window , find ourselves using it least once week peek feathered friend who visiting . nice clear lens , pretty easy find objects through them . certainly job we need it . don't buy this if you your birding out field - these not particularly portable nor leightweight not meant ; buy binocular specifically made purpose . only complaint , it minor , i find lens caps flimsy little hard use . we generally just keep them off	-1
case arrived promptly seems good quality . i received what i ordered . good product	1
this camera almost five star camera . disabling raw capability ( available previous model ) some clunky controls operation keep it four stars me . many you , raw makes no difference . great . but those folks who own digital slr cameras , want this camera powerful , easy-to-carry utility camera - lack raw support cripples this camera . next , other reviewers noted , side mounted mode-knob easily jostled result camera mode you not plan it when you shooting . it easy accidentally move this knob . lens cover using it power button poor design well . finally , since i seem listing problems first , like most point shoots noise level anything over 50 iso very high makes camera almost unusable settings where you would like set iso higher . basically , very low light settings compromised this inablity set iso 400 confident pictures low enough noise level usable . good . point shoot camera , this offers huge amount control over shot . you shoot aperture shutter priorities you - theory - almost anything you could dslr . your biggest limitations lens ( unchangable ) sensor ( small , high-noise high iso ) . 90% typical point shoot settings , this camera outperform your current camera . it takes beautiful pictures . wide angle lens gives you ability get more shot when you need so - making it great " vacation " camera . zoom decent , but not outstanding . colors outstanding , this typical canon strength . reading through other reviews here , i also note several people complained camera not fare well after dropped - particular emphasis large lcd cracking if you drop it . i'm not sure how respond ... i guess i would just say i would expected happen . i tend treat $500 ( when i bought it anyway ) cameras carefully . i purchased inexpensive camera case which i use always ( find easy use , since it attaches my belt ) i use camera strap when i use camera . i haven't dropped camera yet year i owned it . if i , i'd pleasantly surprised if it survived - not upset canon if it didn't . there many different types people many different expectations this world , product reviews great place see these many different attitudes ! overall , very good - almost great - point shoot camera	-1
i'm very happy this product , i bought this even though i skeptic its performance but very much satisfied money . i used it my canon sd 630 , i able take around 150 snaps around 20 mins video	-1

i bought this my teenage daughter she loved it . it easy use tiny , yet durable . some pictures i notice blueish outline around people ( their aura ??? ) which mentioned some other reviews i read , but i think this par-for-course many digital cameras tiny lens . since she primarily uses it take pictures reluctant parents , friends , family her dog , this camera just right	1
i not find anything negative say this camera . i wanted small pocket sized camera tried brands such casio exislim . even though this camera not small casio , it far superior camera . size why , it still small enough fit pocket but also big enough so it isn't awkward or difficult use . pictures this camera turn out spectacular , 10x zoom far best feauture this camera . lcd screen also very clear , unlike casio other camera similar this one . you can't go wrong this camera . highly recommended	1
i love it . easy use , easy work every area -- you love this little camera-it my second kodak so nice -- great buy	1
i purchased this camera month ago taken approximately 2,000 pictures date . i've taken indoor , outdoor , telephoto , macro , everything except video . sorry i should played too , but it not primary reason i bought this camera . i wanted camera expanded capability control my small point shoot camera , olympus c-50 ( which i am quite pleased ) . i am very happy results s9100 . this substantial camera . it feels more like my nikon 8008 , so don't plan put it your pocket when you take it trip . i three olympus digital cameras looking purchase olympus but i disappointed their offering ultra zoom class . because i already several xd cards it plus this camera gave me choice two different media types . i also liked manual zoom because this camera felt familiar , like slr . using aa batteries plus i looking . i see some folks say they disappointed battery life , but i haven't found problem . i use 2900mah nimh rechargeable battery i yet run out juice photo shoots over 200 pictures . i not used alkaline batteries , but i understand they not last nearly long . i use evf more than large digital display ( probably old habits 35mm cameras ) may something it too . i think manual zoom save lot battery power when compared some competition . there lot discussion image stabilization , i never it my other cameras , so i don't seem miss it . i haven't many blurred photos but i use mono-pod or tri-pod when it appropriate . but even hand held , this camera produces excellent images even up 1600 iso . there some noise , but i don't think it too bad . printed photos come out excellent . i several printers large format hp plotter produce 36 " 36 " prints i am very pleased results . this camera excellent versatility , zoom great macro mode gives you wonderful capability really get close . i shooting primarily . jpg but experimented . raw . what i read this format it extend my ability , but i need more time learn raw processing before i provide intelligent discussion . i like idea raw there if when i decide use it . conclusion , i am happy my purchase would buy this camera again . if you looking alternative dslr provides lot versatility control this one merits close look	1
bought this use panasonic gs 500 . it great job keeping everything tight together , no bouncing around or loose pieces . i especially like lower compartment velcro . it very handy cables , tapes , manuals , microphones , etc . whole package very sturdy comfort carry . highly recommended	1

this my third digital camera after ricoh very early model less than 1 mega pixels nikon d1 slr . i bought this one mainly because it almost impossible use d1 every occasion we like take pictures our little boy who only 2 . d1 zoom lens way too bulky , heavy sometimes hard use my wife . she loves this coolpix camera . 5.1 mega pixels , picture quality very good family photo albums . battery lasts surprisingly long than i expected i use monitor all time . i always try avoid using monitor my d1 order save battery . we carry it alot more than we would d1 now since it so small light . i never any problems camera . it works nikon view software i d1 some updates , course . only " complaint " i there delay bwteen you push button it actually actuates shutter . i am used my slr cameras ( i also nikon film slr camera ) picture taken same micro-second i press shutter release button . also af much slower than slr which expected . overall , it very well made produce good quality pictures family daily use	1

my opinion second battery essential equipment camera . camera comes external charger	1
i owned numerous digital cameras , but never found " perfect " one , until now . you simply not believe incredible photos this camera produce . it not small , but it fits great hand . i simply not able take bad picture it yet . photos aren't just little better than other cameras , they're absolutely superb . you not regret buying this camera	1
job just advertised . plus extra sure day saver	1
this original charger came my 10d . it also works d30 d60 , it not work 300 or 350 . it fast charger works well generic batteries . one advantage this charger number multinational power cords it comes , 5 different types supplied	1
you should think this pair good binoculars added bonus taking digital pictures 30 seconds video - rather than camera good zoom ( 8x ) . reason it not zoom , it fixed 8x optical magnification . setting up using binoculars very easy , much easier than normal digital camera . it took me less than 5 minutes get good handle how use it ... rather than hour or two most other digital camera . taking photos film snap . photos look really sharp . i wish it little smaller sleeker , but other than , i no complaints . it great product works perfect watching sports , outdoors , or even concert/opera . highly recommend .	1
i love this camera so very much . price excellent . this everthing i every wanted digital camera . i two digital cameras pass both plastic both doors where battery memory card goes broke , which made camera unoperable . i would recommend this camera everyone .	1
i echo previous comment . we bought this unit so we would able see our daughter her crib while she slept . reality all we able see " snow " camera we keep volume all way down so we wouldn't hear static unit . only time we able get clear picture when camera receiver same room together . i wrote their tech support all they could tell me there interference something else our house . we since spent little extra money purchased avtech solutions monitor much better results . screen bigger images much clearer . it well worth extra money	-1
this review i could not wait write . you simply can't go wrong if you're considering buying this incredibly intelligent powerful camera-the canon powershot s70 7.1 mp digital camera 3.6 optical zoom . so many brands market so many choices , where one begin find right camera their personal professional needs ? where photographer or average enthusiast start isolate camera they want buy themselves or gift ? i really hope this personal honest review help you narrow your search help you develop more faith what you're buying . i'm assuming you probably good deal experience photography or you're person appreciates great photography . so if you're looking outstanding digital camera professional level , you've found it this monumental digital camera canon . this very dependable camera , probably top all reviews i looked while doing my homework . if you're photographer , you know how great it feels put great machine your hands . canon powershot s70 sturdy comfortable they make them ! this camera always take color-rich vivid photos you-even if you make slight mistake or move your hands just tiny bit when photographing . it actually great deal technology built-in designed compensate anyone who might poor lighting situation or someone who forgets focus well before shooting picture . i typically use function allows camera call all shots . first i wasn't comfortable doing . after i took my first 2 rolls camera store developing , i soon discovered i nothing worry i dealing superb camera . canon powershot digital cameras pretty hard compare others this arena . i've powershots long time i've taken over five thousand photos them-they stand up against my accidental drops or drops rain when i've exposed camera water . aside requiring powerful batteries use good amount power , there no downside this incredible digital camera great digital camera maker . i've able these photographs enlarged poster size found them vivid ( even close up ) i could ever imagined . 7.1 megapixels , sizes like 8x10 not even concern when enlarging . canon camera business decades before digital cameras even market they've really pushed digital envelope this camera . if you're looking gift someone who avid photographer like digital photography , you've found it powershot s70 . you stop looking place your order now . your recipient extrememly satisfied ease use high quality this great camera . if you avid photographer , like myself , wish camera digital shots-this baby you'll want buy ! if you're looking take photographs you likely enlarge 5x7 , 8x10 or larger , this camera enough power technology job without looking like digital photograph . often my framed digital prints look better than my photographs taken film-something i never thought would happen ! there great deal information you read this camera canon website other review sites online . you compare camera others same category . you might find some slightly better deals other brands might offer even larger amounts megapixels . really not what you should looking . often number megapixels only possible use special software inerpolate photographs . you don't want worry all . you set canon truly delivers 7.1 vivid megapixels ! canon puts together entire kit or package when you buy digital powershot . i wanted also let you know software that included camera package fantastic literally worth price camera itself . however , you're getting super package this deal camera depend long you want own camera . i've exposed it mine rain 10 different times , i've not ever any even small incidental problem . reminds me energizer bunny-it just keeps going going going never stops ! you not disappointed your purchase warranty canon . i hope this honest review some help you it pleasure write it you .	1

battery grips become widely used accessory those who use their slr regularly . they typically add grip make vertical shooting easier expanded battery department allow longer sessions without battery changes . this grip particular takes inexpensive widely available aa batteries ( 4 ) , which save money quickly over $12 or so pair batteries these cameras take their own . rechargable batteries work fine grip . also included additional shutter release go new vertical grip . i'd love seen tripod socket line lens perhaps sensor canon remote shutter release , which isn't built into many bodies ( if it shutter release button , all would needed cheap ir sensor ) . all all , it inexpensive way add value your camera , save money batteries , simply look cooler	-1
i bought this my daughter camera , it sleek , modern , stylish durable . couple small pouches inside extra memory cards . it far best case available this camera , i highly recommend it others .	1
upgrading tz3 4yr old canon 3.2 megapixel . waited few months purchase when i heard tz1 updated . tz3 , panasonic fixed main complaints tz1 which : no build lens cover , noisy images higher iso speeds . imo , build lens cover alone wirth price permium over tz1 . others said , this camera great build quality , easy operation , high-quality look . i ordered black model pleasantly surprised when i opened box . it look retro 35mm cartridge camera , which cool . chrome ( or polished stainless steel , cant tell ) , first rate looks great matte black case . lcd huge bright . camera " simple mode " great job other modes fully customizable . zoom fantastic , but you need really steady hand full zoom , even optical stabilization turned . i take some surprisingly sharp shots zoomed way my car i came across herd deer . shot shot speed really great , unless you using flash . red-eye reduction works better than any other digital camera i used . overall , i am extremely pleased . if you looking great zoom camera small form factor , you should seriously consider dmc-tz3	1
i own nikon coolpix 3100 camera no complaints it , except fact its size ( even though it fairly small ) pain carry around when you want take pictures . looking much thinner camera , i came across this one quite pleasantly surprised its size , its ability take really great shots ! i'm merely birthday - holiday type picture taker , but this camera definitely enable me take more pictures , because i'll carrying it around my pockety whennever i go somewhere might provide photo opportunity .	1
lot size price comparison this one one best size picture came it . minor annoyances = ( 1 ) always keep frame plugged into outlet , ( 2 ) resizing your pictures realy takes away quality size output frame so keeping your pictures bigger better but you get fewer numbers pictures save , ( 3 ) using menu menu buttons takes little getting used . other than , i no complaints frame . i really wanted one music go it , or alarm clock played favorite song or something affect .... but price quality images this one hard beat .	-1

i just used this camera dive mexico ( my second dive , first attempt underwater photo ) . although camera no flash , it worked perfectly fine depths up 12 meters . i guess lack flash problem some other locations or if outside not sunny day , but least cancun this camera job perfectly . wheel turns film specific noise when film correctly positioned ready new shot ; this noise different when there no more positions camera , wheel turns continuously - so if you pay attention you'll know when film over , even if position indicator may still show 1 or 2 . yes , pictures grainy ( i think it uses iso800 film so this expected ) , but they look " clean " when scaled down computer 800x600 , i think prints look acceptable , too . pictures also show vignetting , but this nothing unexpected such fixed focus disposable camera lens . out 27 positions , i got 20 pictures i consider good enough " keepers " . picture turned out crisp - only 2 them motion blured . try stay still when taking pictures you'll fine . best colors , take pictures close divers/fishes ( less than 1-2 meters away ) ... we also used non-disposable 35mm plastic camera case underwater casing , but kodak yielded better quality pictures . viewfinder , it bit harder look through it googles , but i got better framed pictures than non-disposable camera " target " sistem . if you want spend only 10-20$ don't plan investing more underwater casing digital cameras , this camera good choice . i don't regret buying it .	-1
my first professional digital slr nikon d1x . i got great pictures it but it too large heavy lug around extended periods . i also some issues its operation . but now , nikon seems solved my issues d200 . i purchased dedicated sb-800 flash 18-200 lens recommended d200 manual . whole system much improved over my other digital slr . both focus metering seem work more reliably . it works better available light . optical anti-vibration aids overall picture sharpness ( plus those us who not rock-steady ) . i am getting use button sequence required enlarge picture preview really like amount magnification possible . menuing system seems quite extensive well-organized . i would like more latitude picture quality settings ( e.g. contract , saturation , sharpness ) . help screens really tell me something when i'm confused . i appreciate " modeling " feature . it useful when attempting compose dark situation . it also lets me see reflections before they committed picture . unfortunately this feature not work using built-in flash . i wish nikon could add some type lock continuous-single-manual focus selector front camera . my finger seems move switch unknowingly . i would appreciate battery charger built plug rather than detachable cord . person who still wears thick glasses , i wish nikon could make viewfinder more like one their old n8008 . or maybe it time away pentaprisoms mechanical mirrors give us truly pro camera mimics high-end pro-sumer models electronic viewfinders adjustable view screens	-1

i liked camera lot , but it few irritating details compared gs150 . if i knew these before purchase , i probably would purchase gs150 itself . camera itself fine , but description doesn't indicate you cannot transfer video over usb cable . you separately purchase firewire cable . gs150 allows you transfer video over usb . gs150 comes software video editing , it built-in lens cap .	-1
this really great camera ( it purpose ! ) this isn't camera get if you want super-fine shots or some kind amateur photographer . if you want camera preserve memories , snap shots during travel , parties , etc , this one get . here few my favorite things camera : solid construction . thing just reeks quality . very fast startup time - not only it easy fit pocket so you grab it while other idiots unzipping their camera bags , but it starts up so fast you're taking picture before you know it . portability - i've taken this everywhere . i've gotten great pictures i'd never gotten otherwise because this camera small , unobtrusive , always available , etc . i'm very happy this purchase my next digital camera ( sooner or later people laugh 5 megapixels ) definitely card/small sized casio	1
i bit tenative writing this revierw lest world know our secret - then they'd all one too . we looking something put under our pd170 stubled upon this beauty . construction quality solid unit tripod stable . fluid head panning just good i could expect . smooth steady . tripod shoe nice cork pad protect bottom your camera . tripod would good buy just its basic features , but what sets it apart lanc remote control built into handle . its great . lanc ( or control-l ) compatable cameras made sony ( this sony product ) cannon some others . handle you on/standy switch , record button , photo button , zoom rocker . stuff we've so far its supeer . i keep my hands handle get shots i want . remote control makes makes using camcorder tripod slick experience . only thing would make this better deal if they added focus control remote . far usage - only other issue it took while get feel how much tighten tilt knob lock it down - i didn't want over-torque it break something didn't want camera slowly moving either - but once you get feel its fine . this tripod good buy . but don't feel like you run out get one . we like only cool geeky ones	1
i love my kodak easyshare p850 camera ... only problem night shots or indoor pictures low lighting coming out shadow or too dark . this flash makes all my night shot photos prodessional quality ... no more shadows , underexposure or overexposure	1
extremely impressed tz3 . this gem should get 5 stars construction finish alone . just holding it your hands it screams quality feels like tank . love it . it seriously feels like $700 camera . no exaggeration . i little worried it not able fit my jean pockets before buying it . women may issues really tight jeans but us guys no problem . it fits fine . i seriously cant believe i carry around camera 10x zoom inside my jean pockets . truly remarkable . 3 " screen amazing . you practically enjoy your pics right screen w/o even printing them high res output . navigation so easy this camera . something not surprising though if your already coming panny ( fz7 here ) . picture quality great . i tested it out today standard i would say its just good my fz7 daylight better lowlight ( indoors ) . image quality great , if you need extra sharpness you could always use camera " vivid mode " or add little some post processing . pics standard natural mode pp very well . wide angle something new me . took some neat shots looked very nice extra viewing angle . very distinctive after this i'm not sure if i could go back . if your looking it all camera this may very well your tool choice . combine it extreme versatility coupled excellent image quality , superb lens , build , finish you yourself winner .	1
luck would it i only got use set once . but wow great eye peices . if you're just getting star gazing great way star	1
i recently bought this case my canon sd-300 . i little nervous when i saw max depth 10ft but it only case this camera so i thought i would give it shot . i took it caribbean cruise me let me just say wow . within 5 minutes i applied thin layer grease waterproof ring , slipped camera , closed it up jumped water . underwater pictures came out amazing . i even went scuba diving down 65ft no problem , besides little nervous . underwater movies also came out amazing . sometimes so clear it hard tell i water . day we hiked up waterfall , everyone jealous see me taking pictures under mist . i around 100 incredible pictures this trip i never could gotten without this case	1
my product arrived time i expected product untouched . i would recommend this service	1
i work film production , ( both photography video ) . i bought this my digital camera my camcorder . it not high tech any means , but it very useful . i don't like plastic parts , but price it sturdy enough . it worth money no doubt !!	1
this flashlight what it supposed , it good range brightness . i especially like thumb power switch/rheostat -- it easy comfortable operate . my only complaint circle illumination relatively small . i would prefer wider cone light illuminate wider area	-1
although main part case which my camera resides useful , i dismayed when i received it strap one clip broken first time i opened closed additional pocket , zipper broke . only reason i not returned it new one cost shipping would make it too expensive	-1
i got this light go my full rig i use wedding videography . some lights out these soooo expensive but i saw lot good reviews this light thought i would give it go . here goods bads . goods - works batteries go my pd150 camera so no need silly looking belt battery pack or extra batteries . it comes 10w or 20w setting . so far it also proven itself durable . not i am clumsy but i dropped it twice it survived . i understand bulbs expensive but i used it 2 years now out need change . it lightweight fits slide foot top my camera . most pro non pro cameras this too so i use this my tiny consumer camera its great there too . bads - i guess this stuff isnt really bad but folks who might pro rig these things might bum you out . no dimmer , no barn doors , so swivel . one thing i say though this thing so light i few times taken it off camera held it my hand up high angle so not shine it anyones face directly . i hope this helps	-1
this very durable , attractive case camera fits perfectly . only thing i would change belt loop stitched rather than snap case catches bus or airline seat arm rest pulls loose	-1
only knock it it needs more dampening , but covered ad nauseum other reviews magazine articles . i took photos moon this lens just stunning	-1
mac user who favors still photography , i like take bits video here there , this fits bill perfectly . only taken video indoors so far i've found video quality perfectly adequate ( no faces hidden shadows ) . sound fine , too . software included functions fine my mac ( although i think you camera plugged see video you've stored your computer ) . also imported avi files into imovie easily	1
this camera very easy use , pictures excellent . my family loves it !	1
i am definitely amateur photographer - so what it worth , i am very pleased this camera . previously owned ex-z1000 , i say this camera big step up . i buy all extra cords transferring pictures my z1000 , but this one came everything i needed . also - battery life great . plus - shutter response time much quicker than z1000 . you choose 7 different picture sizes/pixelation . up 10 megapixels ! video camera pretty sweet , too -- you zoom out during filming . one neat features audio recording - like little pocket tape-recorder . only thing , my computer doesn't automatically detect audio files when transferring -- i go manually select them . ( this might just something my computer setup , though ) . all-around , i'm very pleased this camera !	1
real bright flash , work great my camera . lights up long way , away , getting more into my pictures . camera flash isn't enough flash , 383 flash makes up what camera can't reach	1
i'm not 13 i'm 15 but i not account comment . i bought this camera through amazon my graduation present . i it already few months its good camera . its easy use , lots different settings , large nice screen , even makes long movies . its not small other more expensive cameras , but its not huge bulky . there few negetive things it : it uses batteries , charging it mean you buy new ones . i solved this problem buying rechargeble batteries , they last longer you reuse them . battery life this camera not great too . well might fault my duracel batteries . if this camera would better battery life then it would five stars . overall this great camera , great price . good teens beginners cameras plus budget friendly . i got it under $120	-1
case well designed protect camera mounted one belt or worn over shoulder ( strap camera protrudes case make shoulder use possible ) . case small holder extra battery extra sd memory card . i think i find case useful , though i bought inexpensive soft case ( $10 ) may handier than hard case . since canon g4 high-end digital camera , it may best hard case protect camera certain situations , even though soft case might handier other situations	-1
i compared this camera against gs85 gs320 , i found ois exactly same all three models , body , gs320 500 bucks give you leica lens , it true . but comparing picture these three proved me gs80 gives better blacks more colorful image , 279 , its great deal . its important note all three these cameras come firewire standard , something thats lacking camcorders almost any price range other manufacturers . firewire essential video editing , make sure whichever camcorder firewire not usb	1
i recently purchased this product my son ( marine biology student ) we used it while snorkeling caribbean recent cruise . product perfomed well very easy use . this product allowed all features canon camera used its fullest outcome some outstanding underwater shots blue tangs , parrot fish rather menacing looking barracuda taken temporary residence under dive boat st. thomas . looks like expensive piece plastic box - performs like swiss watch	1
my husband purchased this camera me my birthday last year . his aunt uncle one we thought it simply amazing . since our purchase , we've help several our friends family members buy same camera through amazon . actually , we've bought 4 other ones besides one my husband bought me my birthday . i highly recommend this camera everyone . it small , many neat features , quality pictures best i've ever seen any digital camera . don't just take my word it , buy one see yourself . it very affordable . ( best feature	1
yes , it costs bit more than disposable camera . but like other reviews siad , if you spent $400 + camera , why not underwater case . i amazed how well it built . i felt totally safe putting my camera inside it . it takes great pictures . if you ocean , waves current make it difficult take pictures , but practice makes perfect . one tip , when ocean try get close subject possible so flash help brighten colors . i came home few shots everything blue green . we live near water used this case once or twice week since we got it . it really amazing	1
i love camera , but you may want know nikon dicontinued this item . it really hard find replacement parts .	-1
so far , this best camera i've ever owned . i chose it over kodak z710 because not only it more powerful zoom , 12x opposed 10x but view screen much bigger . 2.5 inch compared 2 inch . it doesn't seem like much but that big difference view screens . also , this one came rechargeable battery charger . z710 didn't . it extremely easy focus taking pictures it breeze . battery holds up long periods time . my old camera batteries didn't hold up near long it only 3.2 megapixel camera . this camera definitely offers lot bang your buck . i would buy again heartbeat	1
camera fits perfectly . case very stylish . best all , its pink	1
i bought this camera my teenage daugther . she love it deaf . this besy buy year , she can't put it down . it space saver .	-1
i got this camera use digital photo class . it wonderful . there wasn't anything confused me when i first got it , it took great pictures . software little tricky because it moved all my photos different place gave me very little access , but easily taken care uninstalling software using usb cable itself . 10x zoom great , but if you move all your picture quite blurry . i would get tripod use when you it zoomed really far . overall it great camera takes great pictures good video	1
some years ago i bought canon rebel , one earlier ones , it not so great , kept if while then sold it . i into digital some time now , but , its great , but it not film , not any chance . i very old point shoot , i started taking pictures either kodak fuji film , i then brought it into my one hour developer negs developed digitized onto cd . results gorgeous , point it time new slr , there not so many left right now . i saw eos rebel t2 28-90 mark iii zoom lens , it impressive , light , but just touch heft , great grip , viewfinder , very fast autofocus , it even looks great . so forgetting my previous experience rebel long time ago i bough t.t his superb camera , this just no way praise it , i love this camera . since getting it i , ve shot 10 rolls film , all digitized onto disc , touched up where i felt they needed it , ( simple procedure . i shot roll hanger former naval aviation base here , all kinds aircraft different stages reconstruction , it photographers paradise . results i am getting better than very expensive digital camera . i cannot recommend t2 even more , if you want one get it now , i think these cameras gone soon . canon you great job .	1
easy set up easy use . we recently upgraded different kodak camera enjoying easyshare dock . our previous dock different kodak camera going strong after 4 years . highly recommended	1
this good camera money . don't expecting amazing 5mp pictures or anything . if you dark area , it hard see screen what you shooting . course , when you actually take picture , flash brightens area . if you not still , pictures bit fuzzy ... but 20$ tripod take care problem . small , fit purse or pocket . great kids , comes carrying strap so they don't drop it . all all , i would recomend it someone who starting out wants very basic camera , or child . if you looking high quality photos this not camera you . i bought it my 14 year old sister who uses it take pictures football game , put them her website ( which not require high quality photos ) . her photos look pretty decent when printed 3x5 size .	-1
i looked three different digital cameras thoroughly , this one i eventually chose . i'm glad i . it takes very good pictures , settings lot fun mess . pros : color choice : those you without money buy adobe photoshop , this lets you pick color picture only shows color . it really amazing , lot fun use effects . manual : it got manual settings ( some others ) those us who know how use them want little more out digital camera without buying slr . sturdy : my opinion , it good camera ; won't break easily . my dad dropped my first one onto concrete only thing broke flash ( yeah , that pretty important , but if you keep camera case , unlike i , you'll fine ) . i'm also not afraid move flip screen lot ; it doesn't feel like it fall off . 7.1 mp : this awesome . i zoom ton my computer , even if i can't my camera . i get ton detail pick out what i want , even if it really far away . i took some pictures tigers zoo i could zoom so much i could see their fur . it awesome . automatic settings : if , like me first , you dont ' know how use all those crazy manual settings , there ton other settings pick you use pretty much anything . it makes it really easy quick shots , no matter conditions . cons : no movement : if i try take picture something moving fast , most time it blurry auto settings . i go manual settings , if lighting crappy , don't even try it . shorter you make shutter speed , less light gets . focus : because it digital , you can't focus your own , camera just picks something it thinks most important . there tricks get it focus what you want , but it little hard . weight : it little heavy , but it worth it . it takes four aa batteries , but if you get rechargables , you're fine . i haven't owned any other cameras , least , this my first digital , besides family one , so i'm not knowledgable some others , but i've it quite long time , so i've gotten used it . it good camera , definitely worth money	1
i bought this camera gift my 15 year old daugheter . she loves it many reasons . it so slim , she put it her back pocket take it anywhere . it easy use she gotten lot great shots it . she doesn't print out many her photos , but emails them back forth her friends . her best friend canon elph pictures don't look any better than shots my daughter takes her new casio . only problem we ever it one time lens wouldn't close when she turned it off . we take batteries out them put them back . then it worked fine . this only happened one time she camera two months now uses it pretty often . i think this great little camera . it takes nice picture wasn't too expensive	-1
i chose this casio because price , good sho t-t o-shot speed , most important me charging cradle battery life . i got so tired running out battery middle day . all cameras should charging cradle , just like your cordless telephones	1
i bought this case together nikin 5900 digcam . case looks good compact . but main problem pockets . there two pockets sd cards main pocket one outer pocket battery . problem when you open case take camera , all pockets also open stuff fall there . specially when its your belt . i won't use this case	-1
hiii it good case sony very good but i briefer you bay case holds your camera extra battery you need it	-1
this semi-hard case very cumbersome terms handling , first i couldn't really put camera . so , it quite unusable , otherwise protection level good . i wouldn't recommend it . only if you masochist :-)	-1
i bought this camera more than half year ago . my intention get decent camera images , but then also able use it filming short movies . i'm very pleased its performance . good lighting conditions , colors come out amazing . i really really not expect them so vivid sparkling ! darker conditions , well , it still works fine , not nearly bad i expected some other reviews . photos might grainy or not vivid anymore , but stuff still perfectly suitable show photos people . filming , it terrific . i mean , resolution great ( sth like 848 640 or so ) , better than what one could possibly expect regular camera . quality super awesome , looks very neat computer screen . respect . it pointed out you cannot zoom while filming , but not many cameras out there . oh , it also very small gigantic screen great battery life . great buy	1
camera way better than sony hc1 . night shooting great colors appear natural there not much noise or smudging colors . would recommend it heartbeat . my 37 inch 1980x1080 lcd becomes window when i hook up this camera it . great buy	1
i usually buy set filters each size lens i . tiffen always provided great value . these no exception . i would recommend these everyone	-1
