i just brewed my first batch this far best green tea i've tried . my family live less this batch because my first sample cup quickly turned into 3 big cups ! yummmmmmmm . don't know what some other folks here talking when they say it smells/tastes bad . smells just like some better-quality green tea teabags , but stronger , sweeter much richer . taste smoother , no bitterness , much fuller , surprisingly long-lasting . i'm no tea connoisseur , i just know what i like this one awesome . little research web helped . general consensus seems 160-180 degree water best , brewed 2 minutes . i don't thermometer or anything fancy so i brought water just boiling waited 5 minutes before using . brewed 2 minutes then poured through strainer into pitcher . if you're willing go through bit extra trouble , you use same leaves up 3 times . little goes long way . i used 2 rounded tablespoons , brewed 3 times , got more than full pitcher nice strong tea . i like my tea strong , it looks like 2 level tablespoons would still job nicely . use less something milder	1
