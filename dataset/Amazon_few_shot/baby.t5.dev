we purchased storkcraft rochester stages crib natural , aspen changing table , 5 drawer dresser , 3 drawer dresser , 2 side units ( left right ) hutch . every single piece furniture we've gotten storkcraft damaged some way ~ nicks scratches paint lot pieces . side panel 5 drawer dresser piece completely cracked . it obvious storkcraft no quality control . we're process deciding whether or not we're going return all furniture or just get replacement parts and/or new unit . all i'm going say don't waste your time purchasing storkcraft furniture	-1

my wife i purchased this baby monitor preparation arrival our first child , after using it almost 2 weeks i could not more disappointed . we drawn promise clear connection would prevent others listening , but many drawbacks far outweigh this one advantage . this one more expensive highly rated baby monitors , but you certainly don't get what you pay here . pros : 1 . you get clear connection when unit range ( see cons further explanation)cons : 1 . biggest complaint i battery life . even parent units lowest volume setting , you not get more than 5 hours use without recharge . you know when you need recharge because unit start beeping loudly every 5 seconds until you put it back cradle recharge . this great feature discover during middle night . nursery unit even worse , it not take rechargeable batteries eat through 3 aaa batteries 6 hours unless it plugged . why they even allow this unit operate without plugged beyond me . basically all units plugged all times . 2 . i already couple instances where parent units simply not connect nursery unit . they just sit there beep like they if you out range . this required couple off/on power cycles nursery parent units correct . 3 . range not ideal . i 2800 square foot , 2 story house we already 1 issue where parent unit would not connect nursery unit . granted , units far away they our house , but considering this distance only 60 feet , i not think it unreasonable complete coverage our house . 4 . other reviewers noted , lowest volume setting too loud if you light sleeper . since speaker always , you hear any ambient noise room amplified played parent unit . several other monitors market noise thresholds only transmit sound if it above certain volume ( i.e. if baby crying opposed shifting crib ) . also leds also extremely bright dark room . unfortunately i cannot recommend this product . we making due it simply because i refuse throw away $100 baby monitor , although i'm sure i would much happier different product . if you deal leaving units plugged all times only taking parent units out cradle short periods time , then this product would probably suffice , although i'm sure you could find much cheaper product would work just well	-1
i wish i would checked reviews other people wrote before buying this item ! these flimsy , thin little sheets not snug or even slightly fitted matter . i'm definitely going purchase brand actually fit play yard pad . fortunately there other products work better ... if this only option , i might well not sheet all .	-1
seems like good idea seat . i liked handles them hold ( more sanitary ) it sits okay big adult seat . but opening just too small . it not lack deflector . i brand bigger opening our other bathroom my son fine one . this one pee gets all over his legs , seat , stool floor each every time . this big hassle , unsanitary pain clean up each time he tries go potty . maybe it would okay petite girl but not boy . we shopping replacement now . i don't want deflector type because doctors warn they scrape little boys private area cause them not want sit potty because it might hurt . we just teach him point " it " down potty bigger opening works just fine	-1
i ordered this through walmart . com received it damaged , but walmart and/or storkcraft use distributor called seko worldwide . seko delivery truck delivered crib . so either this storkcraft problem or seko problem , but head board piece completely split off two other pieces dented or chipped off . walmart re-odering crib this one picked up me it 80-pound box . hopefully next crib won't damaged , but if so , i am giving up storkcraft completely . walmart didn't rating system leave comments , when i saw others this website damage problems , i wanted relay my experience well . walmart graciously refunded my shipping fee , which large . i then received second crib it spotless . delivery man seko worldwide said they hear complaints this lot blamed air carrier flies boxes out ground shipping location . i also emailed storkcraft what happen other negative reviews , they offered send replacement piece broken piece ( but no mention dented/chipped piece ) then proceeded place blame retailer . i not impressed . i willing take my chances reorder one fortunate customers who recieved unmarked crib . i put it together myself , all parts accounted drawer works great . i only bought this price convertable feature but not buy storkcraft future .	-1

basic idea great ease assembly nice - no tools needed . we used it all grandchildren ( 6 ) one nephew . i think it needs some design improvements : ( 1 ) straps which used hold it chair would better if there strap which went front back , not just around back seat . one grandkids seems unable sit still i keep expecting him tip over chair because it tends slide sideways front . ( 2 ) tray designed slim child . one side , tray fits finger like protusion into hole . other side , there 2 places attach tray slots . only when tray innermost position , it aligned directly front child there isn't great deal tummy room . if you move tray outer position ( available one side only ) , tray cocked angle it still probably wouldn't accomodate child larger stomach . ( 3 ) belts hold child need longer . fortunately us , all grandkids nephew slim . least so far	-1

i bought this seat when my son 8 months old he too big his graco sung ride . i 2005 honda crv . rear facing position seat belt not long enough strap it seat . my suv only latch system side seats not middle seat . i spoke car safety officier police department he told me place him side seat behind passenger seat this would safest place regards incidence accidents since i could not use middle position . reason he told me not use latch middle position ( using side seats latch system ) since my suv not equipped it because latch connected car frame if we accident frame car bent it could tear his seat pieces . i not aware latch connected frame . so officier told me when he able forward facing i should able put him back middle seat it shouldn't require so much length seatbelt . i love this seat so my son who now 9 1/2 months . it very soft cushy . i probably wouldn't bought infant car seat if i aware this seat could accomodate even newborn . i would definately recommend this seat . it very easy install . it not cup holder only thing i wish it when he older	1

our baby wasn't sleeping too well her bassinet when we first brought her home . first time parents , we afraid bring her into bed us fear smushing her . so we went babies us found this , purely accident . yes , price little high what we use mostly just sleep positioner , but we love it folds up travel . we planning skip bassinet few upcoming trips just take this us . we queen-sized bed , it bit snug three us fit , but we it . now she tolerating bassinet so we've moved nest her bassinet . it inclines , sometimes she wiggles down , but she still positioned her back ! it comes two sheets , which great ! it handy led nightlight quick pacifier replacement or covert diaper checks . bedding firm but comfy . i am very happy product , i would recommend it others . it pretty new product otherwise i would put it my registry when i still pregnant .	1
i bought this mirror because it sale i'm glad i . mirror very large i see my son clearly without shift or strain like i previous mirror . colours also bright attractive get his attention soon i put him seat , he seems talk butterfly incessantly . although it not play music light up like some other mirrors , he few car seat toys also distract him well enough when he looses interest mirror . i gave it only four stars because it bit difficult install my particular car . my middle seat not headrest attach it , nor it latch so i resort using some pins keep it place . but all all great item .	-1
this life saver . our little one likes move around crib , but she couldn't figure out how get " unstuck " when her arm or leg went through crib slate . we crib turns into headboard/footboard it still works great .	1
my son this mattress over 2 years now its form still great . he wont sleep anywhere else other than his bed . we now use it his toddler bed i layed down it few times ( pretending nap ) believe it more comfortable than my bed !!! it really full mattress offers great support our little ones spines !! why we purchased our second one our new daughter . i know my son isnt ready give his bed up !!	1
my granddaughter 3 years old potty trained quite some time now .. when she used regular training potty seat she always wanted me accompany her but now she flip flush she likes go alone . i recommend this any child who wants independence going potty alone . it great invention	1
sheets very soft after first wash they also fit mattress well . price good buy	1
container hokey we tossed it , but it great value all products inside . fever reducer/pain relief drops ( just like tylenol ) don't taste too good , but they work . it nice gift gives new parent reassurance they'll what they need emergency .	1
spent money other stroller shields would fly away gust wind , i so happy this one not let me down . it extremely secure since it couple velcro straps actually stitched shield ( thank you)that keep shield place . others come stickers come right off but not this one . it actually covers stroller all way . right now i am using stroller system carriage car seat it , so it kind bulky , but this shield actually covers stroller down foot rest down back behind handles . roominess excellent . cool pop up part what makes it easier put too . it bit tricky first close it since you twist it certain way order so , but it well worth effort . no more fly aways awkward folding .	1
i attribute my son great sleeping early swaddleme . velcro life saver because most babies break out blanket you've swaddled them then you worry blanket smother them middle night . only issue we when he got little older stronger , he would bust out his arm . usually he would continue sleeping but sometimes it would wake him up . i'd take any day over trying deal regular blanket . it amazing calming effect helps prevent them waking themselves up their arm leg movements . you also should really go cotton because it breathes- i wouldn't recommend fleece polyester doesn't breathe	1
i home day care i own 9 these gates . yes , you mount them wall , but holes small safetly factor makes it worth it . gates stood test time , most over 7 years old still same , walls needed anchores because my dry wall given out before gates . i recommend these anyone who needs permanent , safe , attractive gate .	1
after looking all options , we decided this car seat carrier . it perfect ! first , it lightest least bulky all carriers . it folds up into nothing makes very maneuverable stroller . second , it great suspension more forgiving over rough surfaces . third , it far most sleek stylish car seat carrier available . i'm not one write reviews products , but i felt compelled write something since we used this carrier every day last 3 mos , it one most useful things we own . you won't disappointed	1
am very happy i purchased this product , am able stay away hours while baby my mom . it must every breastfeeding mom . it fast very effective . it discreet too , comes great tote bag little bottle bag well insulated . i strongly recommend it .	1
i bought this my daughter when she born october . we used it all winter long . it very convenient easy put stroller or infant carrier . it holes fit staps through , so baby strapped secure . we didn't bother jackets snowuits , just put baby zip it up	1
features make it good : there flap head end tucks behind under your mattress keep it place . top portion molded plastic , decent height , which helpful if you're toss/turner - you won't roll over onto it . lower half mesh , which one assumes allow air circulation , but i think it mostly way allow it fold , portable . there foam wedge foot end prevent baby " scootching " out it . however , this makes sleeper short enough only last maybe 3 months ( more or less , depending length baby ) . i've read other buyers " split mattress , " but mine not split , but one piece . after folded , it obviously bent middle , but i solved just flipping mattress over use . i suppose split mattress designed after complaints mattress bent , so not great change my opinion . i also liked nightlight - just bright enough let us see baby , without waking her up fully . it sized so it would best fit king size bed ( if you 2 parents bed ) , but we managed queen . after reading other reviews , thinking my own use this sleeper , i've come conclusion : length may too short use it long , however , once baby outgrows it lengthwise , it probably time get him out your bed , he too mobile sleeper this design . so perhaps good planning first years part	-1
i bought all this seperately my son but this would great gift recieve ! i especially love foam shampoo cleansing fluid . mustela products smell so good	1
our toddler always very active since he born so when he got his foot stuck side rails we upgraded this one crib tent i . i couldn't imagine not this . i peace mind don't worry my son climbing out or getting himself stuck again . fantastic invention !!	1
i just got my 2007 revolution i absolutely love it . my 19 month old gave it his seal approval when he refused get out it first time he went ride . if he even sees it , he wants it ! main differences 2007 2006 : 1 . increased seat recline up 70 degrees ( earlier versions only recline 45 degrees)2 . increased back support seat back3 . additional padding added seatquite frankly , these improvements weren't huge selling point me . if my son infant , increased seat recline might matter , but his age he doesn't want recline all . sun canopy biggest i've ever seen stroller . past i've put blanket over canopy try shield sun my son eyes , but this canopy solves problem . it huge ! maneuverability , revolution far surpasses any other stroller i've tried . it smooth , steady ride . i typically use swivel feature , but stroller still great front wheel locked position . storage basket fairly large jogger sufficient typical walk or jog . i take this stroller mall today , while it incredibly easy maneuver through mall , storage basket not large enough shopping storing packages way . it very easy fold fairly compact when it folded , but it not latching feature which makes picking it up bit awkward . it not huge deal me , though , since i usually leave it open ready go our garage ( thank god 3-car garages ! ) . i really like 5 point harness my son doesn't mind buckled into seat . he seems very comfortable snuggles right soon i put him . " cup holders " inside seat nice , but he hard time getting his cups into them which tends frustrate him . older child may not issue this , though . shock absorbers really nice work very well . we " off road " it still nice smooth ride . if i hit uneven area pavement or branches/roots trail , it barely noticeable . overall i am very happy this stroller . , more importantly , it got my son seal approval	1
my 11 month old son my husband i love this backpack . i originally just started out using baby bjorn loved until he hit 5 months started gaining weight .. then it killed my shoulders . this backpack great ... comfortable .. lot weight your hips . highly recommended !	1
we black white large monitor also picture quality black white camera much clearer than color camera . color samera picture looks like there some oil lens or something - not necessarily grainy , just smudged looking . i returned it new one see if color one i defective . i didn't see why picture quality would differ . we'll see ! also , you never get much color so don't ' buy it . we didn't care color much size/portability monitor . also , you easily plug it into tv if you want picture tv instead monitor . very cool idea . but overall we love these monitors . black white one crystal clear , excellent sound , good reception too . you move monitor around sometimes if something else interferes it but this very minor problem our house . also , if you walk monitor camera path it sometimes gets static . again , rarely problem . ours sits right near our phones , computers , etc . we two monitors switch channels see each kids rooms which so convenient . definitely " can't live without it " item our family . although regular black white one good enough if you don't care portability/counter space . also , we great experience summer infant customer service . after black white monitor long time we noticed low pitched hum they sent us replacement very quickly , no problem .	-1
we recently purchased our first new car ever ! we wanted make sure our car seat not put indentations into our new car interior so we purchased this seat saver . it easy use so far it saving our car seat . our daughter rear-facing car seat my my only complaint bottom seat saver much larger than base our car seat . however , i think our daughter grows , so her car seat this eventually become nice feature	-1

i love design this chair . it all one piece ( except bowl ) it very stable . i like there back support . removable bowl convenient empty clean . i bought this my third child , but i wish i it my other two .	1
few swaddle blankets ... my son hated swaddled ... so this blanket worked out well us ... he would fall asleep breast then i could lay him down this blanket wrap him up it while he asleep ( no battles ) he snug his blanket which helped him sleep longer better ... but other blankets required wrapping flipping under him , etc ... which woke him or if i swaddled him while awake , he would cry fuss ... so this my swaddling savior ... i since bought more my baby due soon ! :)	1
my son born seven weeks early , bottle-fed nicu . when he came home , we few frustrating days trying find bottle he liked . these bottles great ! they only ones i could find offered preemie nipple . other bottles drowned him , but these just right	1

i looked into these bottles because i going camping trip wanted make life easier me . i using dr. brown bottles but they such pain clean especially if your camping . i read some reviews these bottles heard they better then dr. brown bottles so i tried them out . my son still spitting up little dr. brown bottles but now he dosen't spit up all ! i am sold these bottles . i would say liners kind pain only because you buy extra you make sure you extra your diaper bag . but it worth change my son !	1
i my first baby 2004 , new mom spent tons money cute little bottles pictures designs them only come realise they gave my daughter worst gas ever . i switched playtex bottles right away , didn't any trouble after ! my second baby came 2005 denial , tried cutsie bottles again thinking maybe it just my daughter . sure enough tummy ache , lots gas ! playtex bottles came back into our home right away , never problem . i just couldn't believe they worked so wonderful . they so much easier wash , pre-sterilized liners just pop right , larger nipple looks so much more comfortable than those tiny nipples some bottles . my sister law her first baby november , i swore her they worked like charm . i bought her tons her baby shower , she started them , mixed breast , also amazed they worked miracles ! i would guarentee positive results anyone who asked , wouldn't recommend anything else . those cute bottles may calling , but itn't worth your little one alot pain discomfort	1

i too bought this road trip i taking . it worked like charm . little warning : i usually pump speed 5 , however , vehicle adapter , i guess power much stronger , i could only pump speed 1 or 2 . don't go cranking baby up first . cord nice long , so i able pump back seat . i keep it right my pump just case	1
this item well loved our family . i want go ahead state my only disappointment it though fact it took lot elbow grease collapse it travel or storage . it very stiff always became my husband job . he didn't like it either , way . otherwise it great i able use it until my daughter 8 months old ( then she could crawl out so it not safe use ) . it nice her close middle night breastfeedings . since we only queen bed , it good able put her into it after feeding so my husband i could more room bed . finally , middle night diaper changes or clothes changes ( my daughter huge spitter upper ) it wonderful everything right there where i needed it . it like second changing table . i used it changing table while i sitting bed . if i standing , it uncomfortably low . i bend down too much . ( i'm 5'10 " ) one more thing-it great when your baby wants nap . i rolled it close window when she newborn so she could get some sunlight help rid her jaundice .	1
i use these mats my 2 1/2 yr . old twins my dining room table . they keep mess off wood easy clean . you also travel easily them .	1
i love this secure easy use toilet lock . i used this lid lock my toddler 10 months until 3 years . best thing it , it works well , but not attached adhesive , so it installed removed easily use or cleaning . i think previous reviewer must strange potty , or more likely , just it installed improperly . if used properly , it clamps onto rim potty without permanently attached . i found it difficult remove , couldn't remove it just pulling . it also doesn't rattle if it installed front half toilet not under little buttons keep seat off rim . i tried it variety toilets . we able spare travel , so every toilet safe . i really can't understand what went wrong previous reviewer . i wish i could help her try install it so it would work . there two sizes clamps fit different sizes toilet rims , i found i use one our very old upstairs potty other more modern downstairs potty . you clamp them tightly rim though , or it won't work , would certainly rattle . maybe problem . base clamp that adjustable fit rim toilet tightly . then there swing-up/down latch clamps over lid seat keeping both them down . you lift two buttons same time you lift latch , i found i could easily it one hand while holding newborn , but my toddler , who could easily defeat all our cabinet , drawer , door locks just couldn't it . because i it one handed trick wasn't obvious . well , i recommend this all my friends , buy more my new house	1
i love wireless option you take it anyware i hear alot noise wire but i bought it wirless i use it wireless only there no noise all when used wirless i like it . it what i looking fo	1
i am first time parent 4 month old . i surprised learn babies can't clear their own noses until they 3 years old . i tried using manual bulb aspirator but my little one would get frustrated i would limited success clearing his nose . it usually took several attempts get into nostril once there , i only able get good suction 1/3 time . maybe others better luck than me but these my stats . i ordered nasalclear week ago . i concerned vacuum might too strong little noses or tips would too invasive . vacuum very gentle . i prefer shorter , stouter tip it seems less likely go too far up nostril . either tip certainly shorter than one manual bulb . suction , while gentle , very effective cleaning nostril . i surprised how much little nostril could hold . said , nasalclear comes collecion cup max fill line it seems absurdly large . i yet get even drop into chamber ( there quite bit storage space tubes leading chamber get filled ) so i can't even imagine filling it . i don't find music feature very important . it great product works well doesn't irritate my baby . so far , there hasn't tear caused nasalclear -- which huge improvement over manual bulb	1
our five month old son took right it ! he immediately began pushing himself around within hour he figured out how direct it where he wanted go . this great product !! this injection moulded plastic so there no paint flake off . perhaps he reviewing wrong item	1
this really nice changing pad . it soft comfortable . only thing i didn't like you buy cover it , so that more add'l money . it worth price though .	1
i originally tried type shopping cart cover which difficult use . friend mine using buggy bagg i impressed she able install it cart one hand while holding her baby other . i liked buggy bagg * completely * covered anywhere baby might touch . it comes pillow but frankly padded back seat so comfortable i never needed use it . ( you may find pillow more useful younger baby isn't sitting up steadily yet . ) i've also used it cover restaurant high chair - fit very tight bit lopsided , but if you small baby it works out great ! large pockets back also great feature . i keep wipes , diapers diaper cream large pocket all time , smaller pockets come handy while i'm shopping my sunglasses coupons .	1
i love my clean shopper every time i use it , i least one person asking me where i got it . i also buy it baby gifts all my friends . it best purchase i've bought . there no strings tie , no velcro deal , no snaps or buttons ... it just piece fabric covers pretty much all size carts . keep my now toddler occupied while i shop ( i still use it him ) i place some goldfish either next him , or front him he eats them while i shop . those who say there no cushioning , that not really purpose clean shopper ! it purpose act buffer you cart . if there cushion it tons bells whistles , then it would too bulky too cumbersome deal . i easily flip it cart one hand while i've got my kid my other . i highly recommend clean shopper any parent	1
i using maclaren triumph past 18 months , envious all features my friends strollers . what my stroller missing ? - leg rest , window through canopy , greater sun shade , ability increase recline thoroughly , all found zooper twist , plus more . i love matching boot , accessories included . i may go ahead order more structured cup holder cuz i dont trust mesh one coffee . also , wheels smaller than what you might find more expensive stroller , so longer walks you may want nicer zooper model . other than , it gorgeous , perfect mall walking/ shorter street walks . my friends now stroller envy me change , thats fun . ; -	1
this product really great idea- it also well made . sadly , it worked 10 minutes our 3 year old daughter- she figured out how get it off . certainly recommended item those whose children don't like playing " houdini escape artist " routine .	-1
it wonderful deal price . i especially like safety feature t-bar holds child without tray	-1
this potty so small easy use go , making it indespensable tool potty training . it comes little carrying bag folds up so small you fit small bag , large purse , under seat car , just anywhere , so you it handy when kids need go . this way kids potty trained don't use large adult toilets public restrooms if they aren't comfortable they use this anywhere , if there isn't restroom nearby . refill bags could get expensive so we just use generic plastic bags they work fine too	1
easy assemble , solid wood , no damages , nice color good price .	1
smell these wonderful . they very soft not crumble irritate like huggies wipes . package very convenient diaper bag too because it closes completely so wipes don't dry out	1

i spent hours online stores comparing cribs my grandson . very hesitant purchase something this big online , especially after reading some reviews it coming damaged , but when i saw price , cheap shipping , i figured it worth try . i am so glad i . crib arrived time , perfect shape , packed very secure , not scratch . directions easy follow , all parts included , we it up hour . ( even two old grandparents . ) my daughter spent almost $500 her crib , i think this one more sturdy better looking . haven't chance put our little guy it yet , but so far i believe we very happy it . i plan getting round teether covers top rails , since i don't want him scratching it up his teeth ! would recommend it anyone , especially this price .	1
i received this gift my baby shower . i 2 pumps hospital 1 pump wic . avent one one i liked best i am still using it . it small easy use . it also nice because you attach bottle or throw away containers , or use collapsible liners it comes . i don't pump lot or often , so it perfect me .	1
this jumper great . my son doesn't really like jump it , but he love play attached toy . plus it loops straps so i attach my own toys it too . i bought it thinking he would spend long time jumping away , but it turns out , it just portable " exersaucer " he plays ( which great travel , or just place him play ) . i bought some others market without toys , he would very bored . maybe my next child use it actually jump ? ;	1
my granduaghter only 5 months , but i am sure we get great use out this walker	-1
leaking : put pieces wrong or over tighten , they leak . pay attention assembly so you put small plastic pieces exactly they came out it won't leak . hard find : local stores/markets rarely cary avent line products . i would guess it because they don't sell . they probably don't sell because they're ... expensive : finally found avent magic cup market . it $8 one cup . since then , haven't able find any any price my local stores . we're raising our granddaughter she drug baby . change doesn't come easy her it very hard teach her anything new . after trying every cup market ( reason i only purchased one time ) , this one finally trick	-1
we several toilets so i bought other potty seats intially so i didn't carry up down stairs . handles must user get cleaner take seat out without touching icky stuff . boy cup this one not removable user . one other model i , cup didn't last day . this ring far most stable . reviews it unstable , i wonder if foam supports put . addition , your child supposed supervised bathroom ! good grief ! they shouldn't leaning over anything ... hand them book ! chafing ? how long kid sitting there ? overall excellent seat . i ended up replacing all potty seats house this model .	1
