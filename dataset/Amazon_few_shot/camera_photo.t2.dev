i bought this lens my canon 30d after reading every professional review i could find . i knew going this lens wasn't perfect but , supposed better than 18-55 kit lens . i liked range it provided image stabilization . i shot pictures this lens extremely dissapointed . pictures not sharp all colors dull . i thought it might my new camera first because i couldn't imagine quality would this bad . i ruled this out after i used my canon 28-105 lens i my canon film slr results much better . digital focal length though , my old lens wouldn't suffice because 1.6 focal factor . later , i decided tamron 17-50/ 2.8 after reading reviews . salesperson professional camera store guessed my pictures very soft when i told him i this canon lens . he said , " let me guess , you'd like try tamron 17-50/ 2.8 . " he said this very best lens buy price range take it home try it . i could return it no questions asked if i wasn't satisfied . he also said he hadn't one person return it yet . my first images this lens great . they sharp way more vibrant color . there absolutely no comparison all . i hesitant buy third party lens but , my fears instantly eliminated after seeing results . this first review i ever posted amazon . i so dissapointed i wanted help others not make same mistake . after spending $$$ digital slr , it would waste not get great pictures it because lens . before taking chance buying canon , yourself big favor try canon tamron local store .	-1

i too , loved camera , despite small lcd screen size , until it got infamous white screen death this particular camera known , which usually occurs after warranty expires ( 1 year ) . photos outside great , poor low-light photos though , but i paid $100 it ( $20 coupon it $80 ) . small lcd screen means it takes less battery power , so rechargeable aa batteries lasted long time . white screen death temporary solution : turn camera off , quick rap your knuckles " cybershot " logo front camera . then turn it back . repeat if necessary . it'll probably happen again , but it beats buying brand new camera if you're vacation don't time bargain shop	1

hoods offer several benefits photographer . primarily hood shades lens stray light may result unwanted discoloration or hazing image , or appearance lens flare . shading your lens helps improve contrast image quality . hood not required eliminate these problems , any item used shade lens provide same protection stray light . hood convenient it built offer protection while ensuring it not inadvertently find its way into your image . photographers often state protective abilities hood reason one . this hood solid conical two inch long offers some protection keeping moisture wind blown debris off lens element . there nothing more irritating than reviewing your images find dust spots or other flaws . when place , hood protect lens impacting solid objects . replacing damaged hood usually cheaper than repairing or replacing lens . this hood manufactured canon 85 f/ 1.8 usm ef , 100 f/ 2.0 usm ef , 135 f/ 2.8 usm ef , 100-300 f/ 4.5 - 5.6 usm ef lenses normally not included lens when sold new . amazon often suggests purchasing one your lens , worth considering . since hood wider than lens ; it easily stored attached reverse position . this doesn't add length lens , but make it wider inch . inch may not seem like lot , but tightly packed camera bag , it huge . fortunately canon provides storage case lens used addition your camera bag . while protective benefits exist , they secondary limited . i find impact hood my image quality more convincing reason use hood . considering impact image quality low cost compared my other camera equipment ( except lens case ) , purchasing hood money well spent . pros : improves contrast image quality offers limited protection lens cons : takes up more space your camera bag store len	1
i started d50 loved it very begining . i felt ready step up next level , but didn't think i ready d200 . when i heard d80 , i read everything i could . biggest selling point fact it same internal workings d200 more consumer friendly d50 body . i don't use all mode setting find myself shutter aperture priority most time , but it nice others there when i don't want think or time fiddle settings . camera image enhancements amazing -- but word caution . vivid +2 definitely give you vivid shots -- if not too much so . i've this baby 2 weeks imagine it my camera next couple years . compared canon 30d ( which i thinking ) or even new 400d ( i haven't actually held one yet ) , this nikon . batter life , i recent shoot where i took over 800 shots 3 hour period . battery half that quite bit lcd viewing . this level both canon nikon offer great equipment -- you can't go wrong either . just get one each your hands , snap few shots , go one feels best you	1

i've this camera three years . i bought it new , when it cutting edge very expensive . i put 128mb cf card it . first , i say i never slightest problem this camera or software . i've probably taken upwards 5000 pictures it , it all over country . software installed windows 95 , 98 , 2000 xp i haven't any problems it . camera solid , performs well , takes good pictures , battery lasts pretty long if you disable lcd viewfinder . if battery life big deal , one could purchase second battery rotate . all said , i am little disappointed quality pictures camera . they razor sharp , color balance perfect , focus great . when taking pictures people , however , it shows every flaw subject skin . scratches , oil , freckles magnified come out looking horrific . it requires extensive photoshopping fix flaws . other cameras taking pics same subjects turn out looking much better . i also say it takes very long moment camera its digital image processing time you press button when camera actually takes picture . time shot taken , something ( especially squirmy child or sports play ) invariably moved it not exact picture you wanted . i'm going buy real single-lens reflex ( slr ) take baby pictures , but i'll keep this travel camera	1

i viewed concert photos taken s2 number different photographers they absolutely took my breath away . saw output other cameras comparison they didn't even come close . i using canon a80 prior while i happy it , my first round photos s2 proved most impressive . while you use this point shoot , this camera you should spend some time learning so you get most it . although s3 latest version camera , i'm not sure you get much more money	1

i received one these christmas ... so i've it 6 months now . i've taken thousands shots it , both canon digital rebel xt ( 350d ) canon eos 20d . bottom line ... i really like lens . although you must learn optimize its use 200mm . specifics ... 1 ) 200mm ( max telephoto ) , you see some blur if you don't use high shutter speed hold it steady . this means just placing your camera green " point shoot " mode , or even " " mode may not give you fast enough shutter speed keep blur unless you bright daylight . so .... here my technique : 200mm you may want bump up your iso ( film ) speed 400 or 800 , then use tv mode ( canon settings i'm talking - manual shutter speed control ) get fast shutter speed . i also hold end lens ( petal filter ) my left hand lean against solid object or good foot stance - or use tripod . all this not any sort lens defect ; rather , it typical using long tele lens not image stabilization ( ) . you get canon , but ready lay down some $$$ carry multiple lenses ... more later . 2 ) noisy autofocus . yeah , true , it louder than other lenses , but so what . it not any louder than fake autowinder sound my rebel xt makes . i find its focus quick accurate - except low light . although , i say my 20d much better than my 350d this lens low light . but , honestly , i don't think low light autofocus any worse than canon 18-55 kit lens i initially ised . it hunted lot too low light , often would not lock - necessitating manual focus . perhaps it camera , not lens . regardless , manual focus sigma works great low light , or , keep autofocus , you use external flash ir focus assist it locks right up . other than tamron , you not find versatile lens this one , especially this price point . optical quality great my lens . you better - but two lenses . my solution this kind range if $$$ no object would canon ef-s 17-85mm f4- 5.6 usm canon ef 70-300mm f/ 4.5 - 5.6 usm ... this would add image stabilization 100mms more range , but much more cost , you would carry two lenses . i specifically bought this lens compact , one lens solution . if you read all reviews you find , general consensus sigma better than tamron 18-200 . plus , end barrel not rotate , so you use circular polarizer . show me lens better bang buck one lens solution , i'll buy it . until then , i love my sigma	1

i originally gave this camera 5 stars . when i windows 98 it wonderful but i got new computer last november xp usb software sooo ... not compatible xp i found however you just buy card reader solve this problem . new drivers cannon site not help all but try them if you want they made me use backup software . adobe software also wonderful 98 but it not let you print correctly xp so you forced create your document then either print it windows or export it application . but it takes gorgeous pictures 2.1 mp camera	1

i've looking digital slrs ever since canon came out its 10d . since then , there so many so many companies . i've always canon user . i 2 eos bodies-the elan iie 7e . also canon ix , its aps camera which i still ( its small viewfinder major disappointment ) . anyhow 30d came , its viewfinder small too . camera still too large me , i just wasn't sold . now nikon d80 . it narrower than canon 30d , what breathtaking panoramically big viewfinder . such delight use . 2.5 " lcd seems fit perfectly back : nothing bigger or smaller would righ t.t he pictures fabulous . i bought 2 gb sandisk ultra ii card , which i thought would fast . it takes half second picture come lcd , but i'm not complaining . 2 gb big card . it hold 500 photos using normal jpeg , large image . i'm sure 1 gb would faster . canons , onboard flashes never would use advanced metering external flashes provided , but nikon d80 , i see such perfectly illuminated photos onboard flash . 18-135 lens something i jumped . 28-200 35 mm size quite huge range , yet lens not massive . i thought hard image stablization you could get canon 18-85 lens , but naaah , 30d just not measure up so i dropped idea . there always such things called tripods !! entire camera , lens battery feel just right , not too heavy . lens excellent . kit fits nicely into relatively small lowepro bag . this truly camera worth waiting years . 12 or 14 mp models sure come couple years , but i doubt they make bodies any more compact ; file size large enough it 10 mega-pixel . d80 so perfect shape i doubt nikon much better . this one fantastic digital slr . raj	1

i quite annoyed when i found my d70 come out box dust lens . place i bought it would only send it away nikon cleaning , but friend same camera advised me get dust blower showed me how i should able blow dust off myself . first blower i tried didn't enough power dust remained . i almost decided take camera get it cleaned when i read review suggested this one . i took chance , after 15 minutes trying , checking , trying again , i finally dust free sensor ! this most valuable piece equipment i purchased my camera , i recommend this anyone similar problem	1
i never take my uv filter off my lens unless i am going immediately put different filter . there basically two camps out there , those feel you should always use uv filter protect your lens dirt scratches those feel it waste time only degrades your image . well , i tried going without one awhile then dirt started build up front element my very expense lens . although you clean front element lens , i feel much , much safer wiping my comparatively cheap uv filter time time again rather than chancing any actual lens damage . i think nearly unquantifiable loss image quality you may suffer uv filter , it well worth extra piece mind it gives me	1

when digital cameras first came out , i , like many people swore i'd always loyal film . digital could never take place film . i'm not convinced it replaced film completely . there still something i love putting roll film camera , shooting away , sending film processed , seeing results . i also know it bit expensive . i know argument quality always paramount discussion , but digital cameras improving this regard , most manufacturers assuring users while technology always improving , we point where good investment made digital slr it not outdated soon buyer purchases camera . so i figured now time get digital slr . i loyal nikon user nearly ten years , owned nikon n60 , n70 , n80 . my first love , still n70 ( i've told person who sold me camera he thought i only person who loved n70 ) . i purchased n80 only after my n70 cost too much repair , but i've enjoyed way my various nikon cameras handled all sorts situations fact they simple use point shoot if i don't time use specific controls , but it also options more creative artistic purposes . my nikon cameras allowed me capture family moments ease majestic landscapes , wildlife shots all sorts other things i can't resist capture forever . i decided purchase d70 since it close what i've already experienced nikon . many ways it works similar way n70 80 , except it digital rather than film version . like film versions midrange nikon slr , it dial allows automatic setting , portrait , landscape , sports , close-up , nightscape , night portrait modes , ability select aperture , shutter speed or manual controls . camera auto manual focus abilities . photos easy or technical photographer desires . controls easy use , though it takes practice comfortable . personal level , camera passed halloween test , niece birthday test , fall foliage new england test favorite scenic spots test . only real difficulty i've camera trying capture stained glass windows dark setting . auto focus not worked all i'm not thrilled manual focus these shots , but this point i'm sure it photographer not camera . i one suggestion anyone who purchases this camera . manual very confusing . it uses all sorts symbols more distraction than anything else . i've luck " magic lantern guides " my other cameras , but not yet used it this camera . i purchase nikon d70 field guide ( david busch , wiley publishing ) which helpful . it quick reference anyone already familiar nikon photography general but it also provides introduction novice photography .	1
don't disappointed because this isn't lithium ion battery . this battery kicks butt !! it lasted me 3 days non stop shooting . i started think battery never going die ! course reality set eventually charge it , but it lasted forever !! only drawback it takes 2 hours charge :( other than , it lasts you all day night	1
nice quality , but overpriced . nice job protecting front lens , reducing glare some situations	1
pros : - reduces flare ghosting when shooting bright light . - helps protect your lens dirt scratches . - somewhat protects lens case fall . better break hood than front element . - makes you look more like you know what you doing helps keep others carelessly walking front you . cons : - increase lens movement windy situations , kind like sail boat . - takes up more room your bag , even when reversed they still add diameter lens . - people take more notice you , help blow your cover if you trying keep low profile	1
slightly smaller than charger comes s(40 , 45 , 50 ,... ) series cameras digital rebel series cameras . seems charge same time . feels bit more substantial , but that not saying much chargers come those cameras seem pretty flimsy . i can't give it 5 stars because it nothing more than chargers come cameras ( which i lost )	1
i bought this flash my canon 30d because numerous promises canon makes how it performs all 30d automatic manual functions ... they right ! spite it relatively small size , it most powerful flash i've used any brand . replaced non-canon brand flash supposed work 30d but didn't , i could not more delighted 580x . whether you're shooting av , tv , , or modes , you not disappointed its performance . it expensive ; but it worth price if you rely your flash perform your camera capabilities	1

power-2000 xp-333 charges batteries pairs , one led per pair , not described . xp-555 charges each battery independently slightly faster ( 3 vs 4 hours ) . xp-333 charger very lightweight , xp-555 slightly heavier . they work 110 or 220 includes plug adaptors round european type plugs . i used xp-333 usa overseas . power-2000 makes several other charger models well . xp-333 555 aas 2500 mah , there xp-33327 xp-55527 versions now available 2700 mah batteries . aaa batteries charge faster they hold less charge . aaas power-2000 currently come 850 1000 mah capacities . i believe these capacities aa aaa power-2000 other nimh makers twice great or maybe more than alkalines . i recall , some years ago duracell copper top aas 1100 mah . i not found recent figures web , but got old figure calling 800 number duracell packages . duracell ultras appear bit higher mah figure , but i not know . 1.2 nimh vs 1.5 alkalines seems make no practical difference i am told , i believe it correct , alkaline voltage drops rapidly under 1.5 after initial use while i understand nimh holds its 1.2 value some time .	1

this camera really great . i knew i liked it before , but i immediately began appreciate this camera all more when i ended up rebel xt " loaner " while my 20d repair . not xt bad camera , it just doesn't really compare 20d . 20d nice feel it ; it fairly large , which great since i somewhat large hands . features great too . image quality awesome . i don't really need go into all details , most other reviewers excellent job . let me just say it great camera worth five stars . only complaint i camera it doesn't spot metering . ability your light metering off single point interest would great - they add it 30d .	1
first all it took me few months decide what lens buy because i so much research . my choices canon 70-200l 4 , 70-200l 2.8 70-200l 2.8 . after much investigation i opted not buy 4.0 because i knew i would shooting dim lights needed 2.8 . so save money i bought 2.8 non . lens great i travelled utah it . all great until i tried shoot deer full zoom . every one came out blurry could not use . apart it fantastic lens . result i decided fork out 2.8 lens it amaizing . it same optics non but handheld really works great . like some reviews it not make every shot focus but certainly most them picture quality amaizing . fast focus , great colours . fantastic . if you afford it buy it def worth it because lens heavy you shake bit , which noticeable full or close full zoom . hope this helps	1

i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1

this point shoot , so don't expect it act like dslr or even ultra zoom , but what it , it fantastic camera . it starts up quickly focuses very , very quickly . af assist lamp helps this . flash strong image quality very good . lcd smaller than most competitors upper range price bracket , but screen sharp very clear . aa batteries great because they're cheap easy find . i hate it when i'm trip want shoot lot , but tethered wall socket charge battery . movie mode wonderful . true 640x480 resolution 30fps ( only pro duo card ) limit card . i like take my movies , edit them program burn them dvd . 480 lines resolution tv quality it looks good . only real downside this camera its bland styling . other companies making hot , slim , metal cameras look good difficult hold , but this camera plastic body sturdy easy carry one hand . it pleasant weight it , even if it little too wide fit shirt pocke t.t here several websites dedicated reviewing digital cameras depth they give you technical numbers compare other cameras . since i'm just guy occasionally takes photos , i only talk my experiences . i like photos this takes , i like way it holds functions i like clarity smoothness movie mode ... you really can't compare sony camera movies other companies ' movie clips ; sony wins , hands down . sony knows how cater their consumers this camera won't disappoint ! i highly recommend it	1
maps excellent , bought this my 10 year od daughter some wording inside bit beyond her this time but she grow into i	1
this camera wonderful . it fairly priced everything i need it . i d50 stolen am almost glad because i could replace it this one . continuous shooting capabilities make more easy live action stop-motion frame capture . if you want it everything you , it so very well . it also allows you full control camera . i cannot say enough weight . i decently sized hands , more large than small but still thin camera size doesn't feel small . i love this camera . i wish it guard screen , but you can't win them all . only drawback this camera i cannot use one my brother old lenses autofocus because body camera course doesn't autofocus engine . i rarely autofocus anyway , so i'm fine . plus it won't affect new lenses i buy	1

nikon p4 one best point shoot cameras market . there very few no instances where p4 not perform hoped . many different scene modes , selectivities , vr , many other features give this camera broad range capability which pictures turn out great clarity . pixel size picture taken varied so one take very sharp picture fit around 250 1 gig card or around 600 smaller pixel images 1 gig card . this allows great selectivity pictures not force one invest 4 gig card just take day worth pictures . camera takes clearest pictures i seen point shoot digital camera , color quality amazing . overall this best digital camera i found , i would recommend it anyone market . if i find anything i not like , i update this review ! if you any questions or anything contact me , i glad try answer them !	1

i this more than month now . installed 256 mb sd card , currently loaded 800 photos , configured my albums based trips occasions . i set photo frame slide show mode daily auto off settings . 1 week ago , i bought product , pandigital ( 7 ) w/ 128 mb built memory . philips far better picture display where pandigital acceptable photo display . when you look closely or stare photos , you immediately see philips not any grainy reproduction . it also elegant slide show transitions ; pandigital needs work their transitions . you just patient when transferring files your pc photo frame , i find myself hitting reset button more than i really would prefer . i find this no harm my pictures . this resolved just your pictures displayed straight or transferred your card . i just chose pc method because easier management what i needed transferred .	1
i found this product worth money , if you go ne where else you pay more . instant focus works good never problem any part binoculars falling apart , it great starter item someone ..	1

i not purchased this item ; however , i wanted inform westwindtalker2 how use these binoculars ( or any other normal pair binoculars ) . first step , take off your eyeglasses . second step , look through binoculars stationary distant object , close your right eye adjust focus until object focus your left eye . third step , while continuing look same object , open your right eye , close your left eye adjust diopter correction until object focus your right eye . fourth step , open both eyes , adjust distance eyepieces so image seen single object adjust central focus knob .

i using this frame display 2000+ my digital images desk my office . here my comments : pluses : 1 . excellent brightness , contrast , color saturation , viewing angle . mustek frame uses lcd tv type panel much better brightness , contrast , color , compared computer monitor type lcd panels . trade off lower resolution . mustek frame resolution only 480x240 vs . least 640x48 most computer monitor type panels . but my experience actually seeing images this frame while mustek made right trade-off use tv type panels . i compared mustek frame frame apparently uses computer display type lcd panel . other frame much better image details when viewed book reading distance . but viewing distance 3 feet , images mustek frame much better . images other frame dark . color not nearly vivid . viewing angle also much limited compared mustek frame . 2 . excellent transition images . transition fast smooth compared other frame . negatives : 1 . strange display mode . mustek frame native display format 16:8 but displays only 4:3 images . you two choices display 4:3 images . one use only center part lcd panel display 4:3 images leave two sides wide screen blank , much same viewing normal tv images wide screen tv set . other choice images stretched out horizontally fill width screen , distorting images significantly . making subjects pictures short fat . much better choice would crop top bottom 4:3 images make undistorted 16:9 images . it strange mustek frame not offer this choice . so you either full screen display distorted images or partial screen display . neither looked good . solve this problem , one pre-distort 4:3 images 1:1 images stretching pictures height wise then cropped top bottom stretched images make them 4:3 . musteck frame display these pre-stretched images undistorted 16:9 images . this fair amount trouble take each time you want display any new images . there some free software tools excellent job batch processing images stretch crop them mustek frame display . two i found best faststone batch resizer batch resizing stretching images , bimplite batch cropping stretched images . i used three- step process . first step , all images resized 1024x768 using faststone tool preserving aspect ratio . this makes all images , regardless original size aspect ratio , 4:3 images . second step , images first step batch resized 640x640 forcing aspect ratio , this using bimplite since faststone tool could not aspect ratio change . third step , 640x640 pre-stretched images cropped down 640x480 using faststone tool . i found 640x480 images slight better quality than 480x320 images mustek frame . i don't know why . overall i am happy display quality mustek frame . i wish mustek would provide firmware update , if , provide display mode cropping 4:3 images 16:9 instead stretching .	1
this camera execellent beautiful crystal picture sperverb stereo/surrand sound makes this camera one best .	1
i bought this so we could get better look birds our backyard . we keep it kitchen window , find ourselves using it least once week peek feathered friend who visiting . nice clear lens , pretty easy find objects through them . certainly job we need it . don't buy this if you your birding out field - these not particularly portable nor leightweight not meant ; buy binocular specifically made purpose . only complaint , it minor , i find lens caps flimsy little hard use . we generally just keep them off	1
i bought this use kodak easyshare digital camera . it works great ; however , i noticed batteries put ' strain ' battery compartment camera . batteries must bit too long compartment . eventually , compartment closure break . knowing this , i don't know if i would buy this battery again . other camera battery compartment might little longer therefore , not this problem	1
i just doing cr review digital cameras decided add my comments amazon ( i always check amazon reviews items i'm thinking purchasing ... thanks amazon ! ) . i purchased my dsc-w5 little over year ago very pleased it . main reasons i decided purchase this camera its small size fact you could get underwater housing it . i've other underwater cameras but i found this one great above below water . housing so small you use it beach/pool or big waterfest , songkran , thailand without worrying getting it wet . other things i've really liked since i purchased it manual setting ( good underwater sun sets ) ability use standard aa batteries ( this saved me many times when my rechargeable gone dead ) . i also purchased zoom lens ... it helps 3x zoom . when using zoom you sometimes get black hole effect edges , but you just work around it or crop it later . i've thought underwater filters but sony very proud them ( ie . expensive ) . i just use photoshop action elements called underwater i got adobe share site color correct pix . video good also . i've used it underwater high quality setting gives you pretty good video even my 50 " hd tv . it eat up lot space 1g chip , but what you want ... ( may need order bigger one if they're now available)friends mine liked my camera so much they've purchased w7 . thing i'm hoping sony continue line so you purchase accessories future ( underwater housing , i olympus/5050 underwater housing , but after year or so you could not find replacement accessories so i buy new camera ( ie . w5 ) . only con camera red eyes flash so close lens . but then i use elements fix jiffy . other features would make it even better ( sony you listening ): more manual settings . i would like it infrared capability other sony . feature would great don't understand why companies not added it would ... time-laps photography using video or still capability .	1
i recently purchased this scope amazon . i read many reviews suggestions decided go firstscope 114 because it seemed most scope i could get least price . i considered some cheaper models same features , but i'm glad i chose this one because differences quality would ruined my experience . it took 2 weeks receive my scope amazon , but you can't beat free shipping ! scope well packaged , only casualty during shipping wingnut tripod broken wing . i contacted celestron , they immediately sent me wingnut . great customer service ! setup easy , just follow instructions . i scope together looking jupiter next night ( there clouds first night ) . i live city lights combined humidity make it hard see any stars naked eye summer , however images crisp clear through 10 20mm eyepieces i could see 4 jupiter moons distinguish bands crossing its surface . first i little disappointed german equatorial mount . it seemed very shaky i hard time following objects sky . however , i quickly realized i not good job balancing scope mount . it properly balanced , scope movements smooth it very stable even high magnification . i purchased 5mm celestron ultima lens well i pleased images i seen so far . i would definitely recommend this scope anyone looking get into astronomy . i forsee many more hours years enjoyment my firstscope	1

while sony vx2100 better low light , this camera holds it own very well . price , it impossible beat . great picture quality , 3.5 inch lcd solid build quality . most cameras this range still plastic body , but magnesium alloy body ag-dvc30 rugged feels great . i've used it regular family shooting filming plays . so many choices manual settings . can't say enough . here great forum it . http://www.camcorderinfo.com/bbs/f13	1

i bought these bird watching yard . focus them little stiff but i see well them any other binoculars i used . overall they seem good product money	1
basically , 70-300 ed perfect complement 18-70 kit lens nikon series . it worth because 1.5 mag factor which means it actually 105-450mm , which gives you plenty reach . add teleconverter you get 900mm (!) . general consensus it also better than 70-300 lens , although if you're budget or don't plan using telephoto much , extra $250 might better spent elsewhere ( like 50mm 1.8 prime and/or flash ) . this mid-level nikon lens ed glass decent build quality -- not cheap , but not tank-like either . lens extends way out 300 mm , you twist manual focus ring ( which bit stiff ) get it fully retract . plastic lens hood big cheap feel ( not lined velvet like tokina ) , but reverses carrying around . still , it nice sharp good bokeh reasonable value -- if you want better bokeh , go long prime . no macro capability like cheaper sigma apo variant but sometimes lenses better if you don't ask them too much . optical quality pretty consistent through entire zoom range , which good thing ; definitely nice piece glass , although not head-turner . it not quick lens 4- 5.6 , but what you expect $400 ? 2.8 ? yeah right . steady grip , it usable handheld out 200mm ; beyond shake noticeable . rubber grip ring balances nicely objects without worrying scratching finish braced shots . if you plan using it handheld fully extended , consider vr version , although you'll still want tripod longer exposures . 70mm bit tight wide end , but passable portraits . non-macro , it lets you get reasonably close shallow depth field . no noticable lens creep . not super lightweight , but not too heavy either . doesn't take up much more room bag then 18-70 . middle-of-the road most categories , except optical performance , which above average . good nature or wildlife w/tripod , or law-enforcement/private detectives , handheld " stakeout " surveillance shots ( which don't require perfect clarity ) . if you plan using it sports or action low light , good luck -- use speedlight tripod/monopod , set up spot , lock focus , wait subject come into view . wouldn't recommend it tracking quick-moving objects beyond 200mm . 70-300 ed super-sharp stopped down 5.6 -8 , beyond performance didn't really improve ; images just got bit more resonant . bottom line , you get some nice long shots this lens , which should good enough casual enthusiasts prosumers . it not pro lens , but then again , it doesn't cost what pro lens . you might able find it used fraction price , but it might worth it get warranty	1
why ? because i never recieved item i ordered . i recieved " globe trotter " charger . it charges okay but runs hot	-1
very easy operate . this camera takes beautiful pictures outside . lighting right inside	1
i really love this camera , yet , there few drawbacks , i would liked know prior purchasing : 1 ) it take time initialize finalize discs ( must plugged not moved so ) which isn't horrible , but somewhat annoying . 2 ) drawback battery life which pretty short ... although it lasts long 30 min . discs . 3 ) side camera just says dvd r/rw , but you must buy -r -rw discs +r +rw don't work ( learned after buying 5 discs wal-mart [ ... ] . ) i assumed either would work since camera doesn't specify either side . 4 ) thing odd camera says it 4.0 megapixels , all reviews manufacturers descriptions says it 4.3 mp ??? i'm sure it doesn't make much difference , but it bit misleading . 5 ) i also total 4 dvd players my house , only one play these little discs ... after i burned it regular size dvd , only one played , but it different dvd player , so go figure ??? all all , though , i really like this camera . i love still pics it takes i love sound quality which stereo !!! it sounds so good surround sound ! there lots neat features this camera software ... i made little halloween video added titles fades such made it look " old " . if you'd like see it here link ... it fairly short , but i got lots compliments it , i'm no camera expert !!! [ ... ] just copy paste link if you'd like see what you this package	1

there one imporant detail this camera , every time there scene transition image freezes half second , when your watching satellite image broadcasat gets momentarily interrupted . this not shown if you replay camera , but it after you transfer your video your pc or burn dvd . this mentioned manual normal , i even contacted sony customer support , they told me same thing . i believe you not like it . i returned mine , i dissapointed	1
easy open close , durable , sleek design , all around great case your canon	1
i looking this traditional look photo frame quite long time . i search no more . i found it . i love this unit it very user friendly . pros -- nice frame design clear widescreen . fast slideshow . pictures don't distort like others . internal memory store up 20 hi-res photos . on-screen menu shown buttons . best all : last memory ! cons -- buttons top just few . no cf .	1
unlike no name gereric batttery this one fit my pansonic digital still camera perfectlly works well . can't comment battery life compared pansonic brand yet	1
this lens one nikon " best bang your buck " products . it very good telephoto zoom , unbeatable price , most amateur photographers find it quite satisfactory their needs . would i like $5000 telephoto ? would i like vr ? sure , but this best way there get very nice piece long nikkor glass tight budget . d40 owners , forget it , this not af-s lens	1
this camera lot going it , quality great low light sensitivity which important me indoor shooting . i get used cradle thing i don't normally stream live pc so not big concern me . camera compatible xp sp2 , just because driver doesn't microsoft " blessing " it still works perfectly . still imaging capability little less than i expecting , flash very close lens which forces you remove any kind additional lenses when using flash . i didn't find small zoom range very limiting but all my camcorders , wide angle lens must if you don't want force yourself up against wall trying get everyone video when shooting indoors . time lapse feature great ! also very good speed contol zoom lever , it very smooth . i wouldn't mind " couple " quick access buttons unit itself rather than use touchscreen menu each time , but able customize quick menu helps make most commonly used features more accessible . battery supplied gives me little more than hour constant use , certainly need one ! no memory card supplied unit either , that consistant though other sony products . overall i'm very happy this camera , it replacing previous model sony which quit working just over 1 year warranty so i didn't think twice before buying 4 year extended warranty	1
i really love my first digital camera ! i searched i searched i finally found what i wanted . pictures crystal clear , movie playback exceptional - you only hear what you're supposed , no loud background noise or static , no muffled noise . pictures come out so clear after you take picture you zoom 5x count pores your face ! i love it ! i don't think i could ask better camera . i hope this camera last me atleast 4 years or more or until i graduate college . if one market afford it , get this camera ! there cheaper cameras but if you want get camera , get good one , doesn't mean it expensive , but my opinion you get what you pay . thanks reading . happy buying	1
my sony dcr-dvd 105 fits exactly this bag . not big but just right	1
it alright first . i looking relatively cheap camera occasional picture taking . outside pictures okay , but indoor pictures horrid . however , after while , battery life drains too fast . honestly , invest better camera even if you want cheap one . this one doesn't last more than month	1
this cheap shotgun mic , also known boom mic . compared camcorder built-in mic this mic uni-directional , so it less susceptible ambient noise . naysayers here don't like it because they don't know what expect or how use it properly . you need read manual follow instructions , silly . sure use it one listed compatible sony camcorders ( although i also got it work hitachi model ) . sound quality same sony camcorder built-in mic -- that why i said this cheap -- but you imemediately notice improvement . trick point mic front end sound source . if i more money i'd bought sennheiser , but 45 bucks , this not bad all	1
i got digital keychain my wife , so she could carry pictures our 3 grandchildren . i download mac software tao website load photos , but everything then went pretty smoothly . my wife really likes resul t.t he hardware gets 5 stars - it works advertised , photos look pretty good very small screen . software gets 3 1/2 stars . it crashed once , but since then it stable . it good job letting me crop pictures ( which important , since only closeups useful small lcd screen ) . it took some trial error find out best way use software : 1 . select each desired photo , edit it add " collection " . 2 . transfer collection keycain . 3 . save collection file . 4 . when you later want add more photos , not open old collection . just start aother collection add new photos . then transfer additional photos keychain . if you add photos original collection , then transfer , you wll end up two copies your original photos keychain	1
bag pretty good , but it bit tight digital camera i bought . not flaw case , but not best ultra zoom type digital cameras	1
this printer awesome . it easy put together detailed instructions . it worked perfect first time . wasn't sure i could it , but i !!! i would highly recommend this printer	1
i am very pleased this camera . i especially like light meter tells you how many apertures you away correct exposure . i am using this my photo class easy use	1
good case compact camcorder . it very compact construction very good . it just enough room my sony camcorder(sony dcr-sr100 ) . external pocket large enough two or three extra batteries . don't expect fit any other accessory	1
these binoculars amazing they completely crystal clear perfect size you going hiking or walking . i would completely recommend this product	1
you can't go wrong buying this seller ! item described . i am very happy my purchase !	1
these great little binoculars i use quite often . they so compact lightweight i grab them whenever i leave house - whether it boat ride around lake or just quick ride . i don't see quite well when i leave my eyeglasses it take little bit more adjusting get focus right eyeglasses , but they great pair binoculars price . i am very impressed quality them .	1
it unclear first how slip battery charger , however , once i it charged battery very well	1
there no instructions this tripod amateur i found it bit puzzling how attach binoculars this suppposed support - binoculars don't stay pointed angle i want . i may missing something how use it , so i'm going try get help web or telescope store . other than it seems like nice solid tripod	1
bought these binoculars my husband . he loves them . they very powerful he loves way they feel - not too heavy . he look stuff across creek amazed clarity things he sees	1
i just received this camera gift . i love idiot-proof menu . instruction guide actually readable . it feels like film slr , size perfect smaller hands ( my boyfriend finds buttons controls bit too cramped ) . image quality great , though i've not used it wide variety settings ( yet ) . feature which i love this camera flip screen . this appears most " advanced " digital camera this feature . artist model , i shoot myself alot . flexible flip-screen allows me get odd angles self portraits . my only complaint auto-release maximum 10 seconds ( making complex self-portaits difficult ) . i got remote shutter accessory , so hopefully this won't pose too much challenge my self-portraiture	1
only previous paper i used kodak paper ( some years ago ) , now no longer readily available . this paper not seem corner durability handling i used recall other paper i used	1
first i could not believe 3 hour time limit true because smaller batteries didn't even last 45 minutes using eye viewer . my surprise , this battery lasted over 3 hour limit i used tv viewer film . i sports videography i need something wouldn't run charge every hour becaue tournament action every game back back . this beyond what i wanted i ordered two when i really only needed one ! i must say this new battery i am not sure how long it takes charge start degenerate , etc . this good buy good price	1
i love this camera . color great , so fun makes me feel unique . screen great size , it takes great pictures . good red eye issue . menu great too , when you scroll thru things , it tells you what it so you don't memorize it all . takes fast pictures , but not one after , like i hoping . but it open fast . don't fooled big memory , you still need larger card . depending size pic you want , you take 30 50 pics memory alone . but all all i love this camera it great buy	1
gives camera whole new selection images all tele settings . excellent macro addition well . it looks cool too	1
i say , some things other reviewers written some truth them , but this battery much better alternative than using 2 aa batteries , regular or rechargeable . it retains charge longer than nimh type if put constant use . it great value compared just running through standard batteries . charger seem lightweight , but i don't see how matters when it charges battery efficiently , which it . nutshell , it worth money spent	1
i heartily agree first reviewer detailed accurate review -- but i'd like add i indeed buy red dsc-100 , it beautiful colorful masterpiece ! plus , it'll easier find , amongst all my black equipment !! thank you sony !	1
anyone wanting explore field photography , this camera ! i past experience olympus equipment , but this first digital side . i am impressed ! money not issue , but i still purchased factory refurbished camera . word street says refurbed products given 500% q.c. , therefore more reliable item . course , factory warranty only 90 days instead usual 1 year , but most reputable dealers give their sale additional year ( ask ! ) . , purchase extended warranty ; you never know . i 500+ shots so far , all i say wow ! olympus stood up tall proud this camera , you too if this camera you choose !! any accessories you decide , make them olympus well	1
i actively looking new digital camera since middle december 2006 . i am real nut when it comes gadgets , domonths worht research , comparing different products , before i buy anything . i simply want best , if it involves spending $40-50 then it . after months researching , reading every single review there , looking pbase , e.t.c. i two finalists : sd900 f31fdcriteria : 1 . camera small ... fit into jeans or shorts pocket2 . camera pretty fast3 . camera great battery life4 . most importantly , image quality superb compared other cameras its class . sd800 looks great paper , 7.1 , 3.8 wide , , fd , nice lcd , small ... it also felt pretty good when i played it store ... extremely fast . however , when i went pbase looked images people posted ( lot !!! ) i couldn ; find one single shot i liked . everything blurry unsharp , so even , i started getting headache looking screen . i truly dissapointed , especialy since rave online reviews ... but i understood reviews relative ... perhaps ( casio cameras :o )i looked all other cameras ( all them ) . panasonic nice ... but it too bulky , very plain . sd 900 felt great , super fast , awesome lcd , great looking camera , fd , 10 megapixels , fairly good photos , nice colors . however i spent exactly whole week comparing sd900 f31fd ... f31fd just beat it completely terms picture quality . if you go pbase look yourself , fuji always better . much sharper , high iso kill sd900 , tomy eye , colors more natural . battery life more than twice better fuji , it slightly shorter ( slightly ) . also , it cost less than canon . finally , i mde my move , bought f31fd . i received my camera today , i must say it super product . pros : 1 . exhudes quality when you hold it your hands , very non-flashy quality looking camera2 . pretty fast all functions . very responsive zoom , almost instantaneous , better than sd900 . 3 . i thought menu pretty well put together . 4 . i took almost 100 photos , quality unbeliavable , all pictures very sharp accurate colors , white balance works awesome . 5 . fd works perfectly well , just expected . cons1 . there small plastic door covers output input conncetions . it made out this plastic rubbery material , you sort stratch it out way plug usb cord . i definatley feel person who designed this door drunk when he , because camera tht great , fuji should either left ports open , or design somethig much better . i really feel this plastic door might break . i try update this review i go . but i must say all time i spent doing research paid off very well . i not regret buying this camera , this best camera you but its size-class .	1
my order received within few days -- price ok	1
i really like this camera , first time camcorder buyer it works great ! i issues low light capabilites also hd quality , but other than if you pick one up used or $450 it well worth it . it fun camera cary your pocket point shoot small clips . love you plug it via usb drag . mov files	1
this camera what it says it : it takes 16:9 pictures video 10.2 mp pictures ok resolutions video . it takes decent video , if you put it tripod . built-in stabilization worthless video mode you'll get palsy type shaking no matter what you . other words , this not replace your camcorder . picture mode , it good job most outdoors/indoors settings if you're not too picky lens distortions around corners highest resolution . this especially obvious if you take pictures where vertical objects appear near left or right edges frame ( like stop signs , light posts , building edge lines etc . ) all all , decent buy home use . not something look into if you'll frequently printing your pictures posterity or use professional publications	1
usual orion nice optics price . would work much better xt 4.5 " mount base . i've experimented this scope taking mirror cell out installing altitude bearings xt 4.5 . then installing xt 4.5 base mount . balance not issue such short focal length . high power views now easy track plus height liile better . if you love your starblast order xt 4.5 " mount base orion . probably under 100 bucks . my xt8 base 110 shipped . only thing you'll dig up used altitude bearings somebody . well worth work . i not suggest attempting this unless your absolutely sure what you make it work , drilling holes bearings , alighning bearings evenly side side , etc . but results grea	1
after purchasing based previous reviews , i bit underwhelmed after recieving this tripod , but what else you get $13 . if you plan using this video or time-lapse work , i would recommend finding thicker , sturdier model . i very small dv camcorder ( canon elura 100 ) am unable pan or tilt without jerking picture . also , if you raise telescopic part more than few inches , it becomes very shaky . all knobs locking parts totally plastic , so it wouldn't good use cold or rough use	1
i bought this camera last december houston . didn't enough time test it while there , but recently went trip island near coast salvador ( i'm brazil ! ) . i never saw such crisp , live , powerful pics before ! decided test its features found myself stunned quality power this little camera . i'm not professional photographer but my pics turned out best-sellers among my friends . i took 500 pics three days not even one came out bad shape . great cost-effective deal : not too expensive . amazing picture quality ( 10x optical zoom 7.1 megapixels ) . works wide range batteries ( aa , lithium dual pack , rechargeable )	1
i bought this rangefinder golf , but thought it might also work hunting . it small enough i keep it my pocket pull it out when needed . i tried it heavy brush , but find mixed results close range . you get good results objects beyond 50 yards utilizing " ignore close objects " function . i pulled it out rifle range today during snow shower pleasantly surprised get reading 101 yards my target bench 1 yard back firing line . snow not affect results rangefinder all ... probably more effect bullet path	1

i just got this camera last week my parents early graduation gift ( i'm fourteen ) i cannot put it down . i used nikon this camera kills it . there so many options this camera i love color accent color swap . i took picture my dog then turned her blue . pictures all come out really clear time shots quick , there setting change time shots camera ! but my favorite part , far , 3 " lcd . it makes all pictures sharper clear . i looking canon sd630 but i know somebody who it i personally think this one better due fact this one new model it less bulky . i'm very happy my camera i hope this helps you when looking camera	1
this digital picture frame great value . frame itself quality look it operation aspect it easy use . picture quality good well . only reason i give it 4 stars speaker quality ... not great but adequate , which not really issue me since i wanted frame primarily displaying pictures wedding . overall , great value quality product	1

i found sony i-link most suitable sony hdv camcorder . i use fx1 1080i recorded signals , others could not match sony high data transfer rate	1
i think this optical instrument should mandatory all golf courses . just ipods obviated cds , this device completely obviate need yardages sprinkler heads like . here my normal round without bushnell pinseeker : i drive out fairway -- hopefully -- then find sprinkler head . there i pace it off my ball . i get yardage , but that center green . my home course i go pin sheet which crude outline green four numbers green -- back left , back right , front left , front center . now , assuming we're playing back left number , i some speculative math determine how far back left pin , add yardage ... you get picture . what waste time !! bushnell zeroes flag gives me exac t-t o-the-pin yardage every time . not get cheaper versions optics not good it almost impossible lock flag -- you terribly disappointed if you get under $200 one . one factors slope not usga legal . i just finished round famous riviera c.c. i caddy . he calculating yardages both me my partner he amazingly accurate , but time he wasted pacing off yardages sprinkler heads ... whenever someone hit it right or left eucalyptuses he relied heavily my bushnell yardages . he not spot-on his distances . this far best new thing i put my bag . it little pricey but then no one thinks spending $400 new driver nothing improve their swing . one thing bushnell really refine my iron distances . i'm single digit handicap this beautiful little instrument just fantastic addition . i don't work company i think their cheaper products garbage . but this little guy beaut	1
canon xl2 showing up alot complaining reviews , complaints realted it less than perfect imagery . what ive seen , fact dvx100b hard heck find says alot which one better . i find it very odd great number these cameras sold numerous retailers brooklyn who go names like express , photosweep , camera city .... seems like one dealer using multiple names varied prices . if you need dvx100b , its best buy established dealer . but no one beat 24p quality this camerta . better deal than new hd cameras which don't even 24p adjustment	1
olympus 740 great camera . it easy use auto mode also gives opportunity set camera specific shots if one chooses . only drawback it very difficult see screen bright sunlight . i am enjoying 740 wonderful results	1

good backup battery available . used it after other battery ran out power when away recharger	1
if you looking good small camera , no intentions ansel adams , this good camera choice . i travel alot , this camera perfect because it fit my pockets or small purse . it also takes pretty good pictures	1
this camera takes awesome pictures , even long distances infinity mode . just got some pics moose 1/2 mile away . only complaint i battery usage . i've camera powered probably 20 minutes total , it shut off due ' low battery ' . testing batteries indicated ~ 80% power left , so i don't know if there flaw camera power sensor or what .	1
i took my first pictures ever using this film it came out looking all right . i suppose it wasn't crystal clear , but probably my fault . i also think it problems low light . my fault ? probably . who knows , it nice get it developed target , though	1

very easy use , customers should informed when purchasing lenses adapted required .	1

million words written this thing , this not attempt comprehensive review , so look above or dpreview-com complete info . i looked canon , nikon , pentax sony dslrs . sony makes sense if you already bag full minolta lenses , which i don't . canon nikon put their image stabilization lens , which makes their ' good ' lenses significantly more expensive . canon eos not backward-compatible their old fd lenses , which i -do- bagful . pentax backward-compatible all k-mount lenses made since 1970s , even take 645 6x7 lenses , adapters . sooo , i set out ease into dslr ownership k100d , then started reading reviews , it bunch little things made me want k10d . viewfinder actual prism , not mirror cage like cheaper cameras , displays backlit , low-res mode ( 1800 1200px ) exactly what i want certain applications . 10 mpx , i point shoot if i , crop ( somewhat ) more later . controls more ' classic ' camera-like than ' scene modes ' beginner cameras . not say this would worth price difference everyone , but i bought k10d , pentax 12-24mm / 4.0 lens , am very happy both . digital cameras use less image projected lens , so your lenses ' longer ' than they would film camera . downside : ' journalist lens ' , buy 12-24mm , which equivalent 18-36mm film camera . upside : my old 50mm / 1.4 now equivalent top-of-the-line portrait lens i never felt i could afford . pentax plans introduce 2007 16-50mm / 2.8 50-135mm / 2.8 , which sound fantastic - but let see what they cost before we get too excited . meanwhile , sigma , tokina , tamron offer some very adequate alternatives . camera lens together pretty heavy , just like older slr , led screen cannot used live viewfinder - no image gets sensor while mirror down - so you hoist camera your eye compose shot . no problem , i'm used it , it common all dslrs . (( my personal feeling slr platform just . it hard see need mirror box digital camera , which use actual sensor compose shot through lens display it back . future top-end digital cams probably lot flatter , like old rangefinder cameras . look olympus e330 or panasonic dmc-l1 see what direction i think we should headed . )) said , i am very happy pentax k10d , it behaves it supposed , affordable ( barely ) 12-24mm rectilinear lens unthinkable just few years ago . this camera ton half features capabilities , i am still sorting them out . there definitely learning curve if you get most out camera , but there also two full program modes , including ' green zone ' , so you start shooting right away good results . pictuers come out great . colors , brightness , contrast need almost no adjustment or photoshop-ing , which not true any other digi-cam i ever owned . happy this , until next big thing comes	1
i sony hi-8 camcorder ten years now , genereally pleased it . however , i wanted go digital . i didn't want spend too much money , certainly not my first digital venture . i lot online reading , got impression hdd cameras didn't perform too well , mini dvd limits your time , so went minidv . i camera just over week time writing . pros : good clear image . audio quality . nightshot plus . ilink . small size . ease use . 40x optical zoom . cons : sony accessories , particularly batteries far too expensive . i shall looking 3rd party sources . no headphone jack . no accessory shoe . cannot control playback except via touch screen lcd . no firewire cable supplied . cannot charge batteries off camera without purchasing seperate charger . comments . it comes some basic editing software cd , but i cannot comment this , i adobe premiere 1.5 , i am using this no problem all . if you want transfer your video into your computer , you need firewire cable . usually pc you need 4 pin 6 pin one . you buy them amazon much cheaper than local stores , so i recommend ordering one if you decide buy camcorder . all all , i am pleased it so far terms video audio quality . one annoyance . if you buy battery , you also need buy charger , power supply you get camera only charge batteries whilst they camera . this isn't much use if , example , you want charge battery home , while you use fresh one outdoors . extra chargers around $40 , well cost battery course . time you buy extra battery , off-cam charger , case , couple filters , firewire cable , you almost double cost cam itself !	1
my husband got this me present i love it . easy use .	1

this tiny camera fits pockets , purses center consoles easily . such , you more likely this you than , say , your digital hasselblad ten lenses . if aliens land street front you , you get shot your s3 , not big camera home . small camera also discreet . people tend react when you point big impressive looking camera them , but hardly notice small s3 rectangle . it not attract too much attention itself or me good thing . there two ways use this camera : one simply keep it automatic , shoot lots shots well-lit scenes delete bad ones . this very effective technique used even many professionals . automation hard beat . or , one actually read understand manual practice all functions again again until it all becomes second nature . there lots modes like portrait landscape , even exotic ones fireworks such . each mode specific automatic settings optimize results . full automatic just fine most subjects , but if you want something special , shot could really something , then it worth time get into proper mode . how i using s3 results fine . some reviewers complain blurry shots . no modern camera blurs anything still well-lit . blur results slow shutter speeds relative camera shake or subject movement . s3 little lens requires slower shutter speed compensate , allow all light needed sensors capture image . handheld shots slow shutter speeds blurry any camera . we used seeing big serious cameras tripods little carefree cameras used handheld . actually , it more likely little camera should one tripod . addition their small lenses , their light weight small size make them harder hold still . note , too , flash freezes movement eliminates blur . however , tiny cameras small flashes not much range so not work prevent blur longer ranges . my first twilight photos s3 attempted me holding it against trees , pressed car roofs , etc . only good results came when i used tripod fired it off using self timer so human hands not all involved . usual daylight shots people , scenes things not problemmost my prints 4x6 really very sharp well exposed either automatic or manual modes . i avoid shots not well lit or too far away flash . prints generally much better than what i used get 35mm . it reasonably fast little lag time or waiting images loaded . camera itself metal very solid precise . s3 comes little dock ac plug charge it usb cable downloads your computer . some people not like idea you take dock you recharge download road . me this not problem dock very small anyway it better all those connections dock rather than tiny camera . i perfect luck so far nikon photographic products tend trust brand , so i bought s3 over some other very compelling models . nikon also very good job programming exposure , focus , white balance , etc . i thought maybe 4 stars because little light camera use vibration reduction all modes , but really effective full time vr would likely cost more i not missed it anyway . if you need what this camera lacks , then you step up bigger much more expensive dslr . you spend more , carry more get more . it works way film it digital well . i would like dslr also , but s3 excellent camera lot options make great photos it would get lot use , even if i elusive digital hasselblad , just because it would always me	1
i bought pink case my mom , i bought her new hp digital camera christmas . it so cute , camera fits it perfectly	1
i took long shot buying this thing because little or no online information it . hopefully this gives you good idea what bag like so you don't aimlessly search internet its product features - like i . i wanted bag genuine ( canon ) held all my stuff so i wouldn't separate bags each individual item . cpb-100 case plenty room all my digital camera accessories : camera ( powershot s70 ) , printer ( cp-220 ) , cards ( 3 compact flash cards ) , battery charger ( cb-2lt ) , all 6 my manuals , printer cleaner , printer charge chords . all items fit into slot some sort - they aren't randomly tossed into bag . there 4 compartments : very large , extra padded , zip compartment ( large , padded 2 slots ) your printer some other large accessory ( i put my printer chords here ); large , zip compartment 3 sleeves ( i put battery charger printer cleaner first , camera second , 3 memory cards third ); medium , front , zip compartment books or flat accessories ( i put my 4x6 printer card holder 4 product manuals ) . there also small , velcro compartment back which i put 2 more small 3x5 manuals into . i still extra room ( though not much ) place more accessories . quality very durable water-repellent canvas front straps appear faux leather - front straps clip shut magnet clips . shoulder strap padded shoulder rest extend plenty your height . bottom 4 plastic plates keep it upright , keep it getting dirty , when placed ground . i fit bag perfectly my accessories . i'd recommend bag if you close or equal amount items i - unless , course , you want haul around extra bags some reason : ) . good luck shopping !	1
dock makes transferring photos charging camera battery snap . if you don't dock you don't know what you're missing , but it great addition . i've owned many kodak products satisfied each every one so far . this dock accessories no exception	1
since i really only few small gripes , i'll list them first ! indoor quality isn't great -- even ' fix ' listed below -- colors mostly washed out so picture looks nearly black white , depending how much light available when you adjust white balance , it almost take sepia tone appearance . also , low-light situations , camera seems ' search ' something focus , causing subject blur out over over . other than , i've very happy my purchase . i lot online searching thru models here amazon , read tons reviews many different cameras , this one seemed most positive feedback . pros : excellent outdoor daytime ( well lit ) indoor shooting . amazingly smooth zoom ! even 32x detail amazing ! very easy use out box , easy understand menu ! excellent design , great attention detail ! very small light ! love 20 gigabyte hdd memory ! very easy pc interface , quick transfer files . power producer works easily windows movie maker . packed features i haven't even discovered yet ! needless say , i really am not disappointed my purchase . anyone who thinks they should able get feature-film quality small , compact camcorder less than $500 disillusioned naive !	1
i just needed case my camera ( s90 ) , i wasn't going pay 40-60 dollars some leather case . inside case feels like blanket , except it happens paddded . it won't stop stampede , but any common bumps ( inside car/bag ) should cause no problems . front pocket netted sleeve , kind like ones behind car seats keep magazines , etc . it good because it keeps your batteries memory moving around too much . my camera pretty sturdy itself , but i getting tired it flying around my car unprotected . no worries now , i get carry extra pair batteries me convenient place . i give it 4 stars simply because it its job , it case , it protects my camera . if it some ridiculous padding would allow me throw camera around not worry , then i would give it 5 stars . if you don't need case diamonds it , this fine buy	1
i normally prefer purchasing canon or sony when i shop around cameras . i bought this casio primarily gifting relative ( novice photographer ) , so i not worry reviews barrel distortion i came across many forums . price i paid , i am happy product . form factor excellent 3x optical zoom decent . barrel distortion plainly visible many photos , which reason i believe this camera phased out more expensive z7x series . other than barrel distortion , i am quite happy product itself	1
this very cool camera it really good design . it 7.2 megapixels it anti shake . very good kids adults who new photography , or good anyone who just wants nice sleek design very good photo quality	1
this lens sharp primary lens . it only draw back need side flash	1
wow ... this such great case . fits my d40x tightly , but still room extra memory card , etc . material very good , well . great deal , great case	1
just described panasonic digital camera . excellant constuction , good fit , handy all battery chip storage	1
when you buy product designed meant fulfill certain needs , just expect best performance out those features . pc55 camera everyday home shooter , easy use made best sony quality one smallest mini dv camera ever created . if you thinking buying this camera don't hesitate one minute , this camcorder one kind , it gives you pretty much flexibility video quality regular camcorder but amazing bring-it-in-the-pocket size all coolness attention it brings ( let it your best ice breaker , believe me it works like heaven ! ) . i work camera store let me tell you : we haven't received one return this model during time i've worked there ( 8 months ) , which proves high quality sony built into this model . i using mine few months now all i say " product great ... period ! " . let get real , 500 bucks you paying it not film quality kind movie you get picture ( you need spend least couple thousand dollars ) but portability worriless no need big luggage camcorder used past " ( some times people don't realize motorcycle couldn't compared truck or vise versa ) . picture shooting option , well let see ! camcorder videos digital camera photos , if you want them both one package , brings excellent quality , you'd spend lot more money than if you bought them separately , let me explain you few words , average photo quality mini dv camcorder 1.3 mp or lower ( same quality you get out your cell phone camera ) honest you , manufacturers add this option just give it extra feature same time take more money out your pocket , tape less digital cameras it happens same way , video sound quality very poor ; so why bother paying more camera both functions excellent ( there quite few out market now , starting around $1200 models similar size ) instead buy two little cameras , one each use , half price . if you looking cool , high quality durability mini dv camcorder smallest size available its kind , sony dcr-pc55 your best option . finish , i just want wish you all enjoy , more than product , unmemorable moments you live your loved ones because this little fellow	1
got my hands one these babies this weekend no-budget short film . loved it . so easy use , picture great . it true , finished look not " cinematic " , which fair criticism , but price it great if you're looking upgrade high-def digital picture . watched playback 16:9 widescreen tv before editing it beautiful . however , you can't rely auto-functions . tried using auto-focus auto-iris start , but ended up doing both manually most part . small complaint considering real filmmaker shouldn't using them anyway . otherwise , great camera	1
just got camera what i've seen so far it wonderful piece equipment . my only complaint amazon misrepresented battery type saying it , " powered en-el3a or en-el3 " which not true disappointing anyone who upgrading camera use those batteries ( ie d70 ) d200 uses en-el3e which doesn't same fit en-el3a or en-el3 . aware this if you upgrading	1
panasonic sdr-s150 wonderful camera . i am extremely happy it - recommend it everyone . popular mechanics magazine named it best its class - i completely agree . i bought mine end september 2006 usingit every day last 3 months . sales person jr store recommended it me , based customers feedback - i am grateful him good advice . camera makes very decent videos . excellent optics , 3-ccd , true image stabilization their job . videos bright , sound excellent . but most important me how easy it work cameraand video clips once you made them . one use cable software provided camera , but i like things simple . i take sd card out , insert it into a$10 usb card reader - copy files onto my computer mouse . then i rename clips - i change extension mod into mpg . these clips true mpeg-2 format , which same format regular dvds . so many dvd players natively play thoseclips without any editing or converting . also most computersyou simply double-click clip make it play . if not - youcan dowload one many free or low-cost software players . i like vlc player ( just google vlc player ) - it isavailable both window mac it free . i made our grandmothers very happy . i burn collection video clips our baby regular cd ( yes , cd , not dvd ) - mail them . they play those video clips computer or dvd player ( portable phillips good choice ) . camera very easy operate . built-in battery lasts ~ 70 min ( use spare one or use included power supply if you need more ) . camera also makes decent still photos . i many more expensive cameras home ( photo video ) , but i found once i bought this camera i use it almost exclusively . partly becase ease convenience . this camera i don't need huge disks , powefull cpus , lotsof ram , or hours video editing . it makes your video productionvery easy fun . camera comes its own editing software . i prefer use adobe premier elements ($99 ) . there also some good software macs . so i easily make videos titles menus , ormake mp4 or flash videos ipod or web . cons : 1 . no input external microphone . but built-in stereo microphone very good - i tested it making recording concert violin - then extracting audio analyzing it using adobe audition software . recording very clean , because there no motors camera . 2 . compression artefacts visible when you making fast movements camera . this rare , though . camera mounted standard tripod . it very light small . overall - i really enjoy it .	1
this camera exelent camara . it plenty effects , plenty modes , plenty scenery options . image quality 3.2 megapixel , but its quite good . pictures you take without flash end up getting bit blury , where if you take it flash , it comes out exelent . sometimes it takes long time picture get taken out flash , sometimes it happens imediatly . but all these flaws only my version . but if you looking good camera great price , this your best option	1
love camera though still trying work details using color various settings . ease basic use wonderful . pictures excellent but what i like best compact stylist package . paid only $180 circuit city made investment bearable .	1
camera all features you could want : - shoots great video- excepts 4gb sd cards- record d1 resolution @ 30fps ( i confirmed it my video editing software)- usb recharge ( or ac adapter ) all included ! - tv output- led lights ( yes , they actually useful ) . - digital photos actually good . - 3x optical zoom videos really nice , but keep mind , these not meant replace professional more expensive camcorders . videos sunlight very good . low light shots not good , but not worst when you compare it other offerings . just sure you least 60 watts light . compare video other camcorder hybrids under $200 , you can't beat this one . there no indication how much space or minutes you left shoot . its annoying , but if you buy 2gb sd card , camera run out batteries before you run out space . led lights fact useful . don't except them light up room . its not because light not bright enough , its because lights create small patch light . hey , its better then nothing . sound nice clear , not muffled like other model , is-dv2 model . but here comes biggest issue ... loud noisy focusing . i'm not talking zooming feature ( 3x optics ) , i'm talking when you move camera new subject . camera constantly consistently auto-focuses when anything changes view lens , but it makes such loud noise mic picks it up . it ruins video . unless if your rock concert , your going hearing scratching noises throughout your video . yes , it loud distracting . it makes scratching like noise . camera takes few seconds focus , but every time you move it slightly , or your subjects move , camera tries focus again , it makes scratching sound . i believe its because mic so sensitive , it picks up vibrating mechanical focusing unit lens . there no option " lock " focus . they , would least remedy issue somewhat . aiptek should resolved this issue even before manufacturing it . if i ceo/president company , i would very embarrassed . i understand these " cheap " cameras , but $200 their not exactly cheap price . they should least fixed loud focus issue before selling it . i really liked mz-dv features , i thought i could live focusing noise . but every single video i shot annoying noise , so i ended up returning it . i would avoid this model until aiptek releases better model , or replaces noisy mechanical focus . other model , which same mz-dv , except it lower megapixel rating , aiptek zoom dv , same focus noise issue . so i would avoid model also .	1
