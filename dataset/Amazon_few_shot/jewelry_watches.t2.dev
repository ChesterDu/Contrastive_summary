i got this well under assumption it wasnt high end watch . after wearing invicta while this feels like gum wrapper my wrist . when i received it , i noticed small scratches all over crystal . nothing deep , but they really pick up glare . atomic signal , i am unable get it pick up one . memphis , tn , i think i should range , all my atomic clocks sync up fine . i tried it facing 4 different directions also tried it outside eliminate any interference house . still no good . basically i spent 30 dollars cheap watch doesnt even backlight . lesson learned	1
heart bracelet came off after second day wear . i not recommend product , but delivery service well	-1

believe it , this stunningly beautiful watch no one guess price unless you tell them . it gets more attention than my gold rolex ! weight , it normal stainless which means solid feel you know it there . if someone wants flyweight watch why would they buy stainless steel ? it reliably functions exactly described . you'll love this watch . buy 5-year extended warranty $25 enjoy i t.p.s. if you need remove links , just put smoothed paperclip vice push pins out . no big deal	1

i just ordered received this automatic watch winder ( garinin model win2gr , two watches ) used it week ( i am using it wind invicta automatic breitling automatic ) . unit pretty well all plastic , " cheap " - yet " solid " - look feel . still , it work advertised , this , not appearance , primary reason i bought it . so , price , i give it one thumb up . few minor points note , however . first , i large wrists , so removable expanding watch restrainers not expand enough restrain watches securely their slots . this remedied placing two 1 " self-adhering felt pads ( available local hardware store ) top surface each restrainer . but this then created secondary , though less serious , problem : front door winder now not close all way ( comes within � " fully closing ) . not problem unless you live exceptionally dusty environment . second , some reviewers noted noise problem this unit . however , i found mine runs very quietly . i keep it next bed , bottom my nightstand , quiet night i just barely hear low purring sound motor inside unit . even then , you really focus your attention order hear it , , my view , only picky critic would find this soft noise least bit disturbing . finally , there switch selecting direction which watches rotate : either clockwise or counterclockwise ( they linked , so both rotate same direction all times ) . what not made clear why winding direction important . if my watches supposed wound only one these directions , how am i know which one it ? furthermore , how i control winding direction when i am actually wearing watches ? finally , what if invicta needs wound clockwise but breitling should wound counterclockwise ? i arbitrarily selected one directions moved ... both watches still work just fine . closing , note there some humorous statements one-page instruction manual . unit identified " time tutelary " ( which name also appears logo front unit pictured manual ) . what " time tutelary , " anyway ? instructions state , " please pull off adapter when winder not using , " , " this product provides maintenance or replacement service within one year purchasing date . " i know what meant here , but still , this case either poor english or poor translating ( or both ! ) . further warranty statement itself , note there outlined box bottom manual which stated , " invalid without representative official stamp . " problem , there no stamp box ( or anywhere else matter ) , so only reasonable conclusion there no warranty this product . i also ordered second winder , garinin single-watch winder , model win1brg , present my son . i mention this note operation manual accompanying this unit states , " using timer recommended this product . this ensure your watch wound properly extend life your winder your automatic watch . average automatic watch should wound four hours day . " ( note no such statement accompanies two-watch win2gr winder . ) first , this 4 hours-maximum-per-day claim true ? second , if winder automatically rotates one hour then rests next three hours , it winds your watch total 6 hours per day , so extra two hours winding really all detrimental watch ? , if eliminating those two extra hours winding each day ( using timer ) actually " extend life your winder , " it doesn't seem say much quality designed-in reliability product ( not mention adding expense hassle ownership ) . bottom line : if you want quiet two-watch winder works advertised , but don't want spend lot money ( don't mind plastic look ) , this winder should trick .	1

i bit hesitant buying this watch replacement my stainless fossil i've many years , but after wearing it awhile now i'm really happy purchase . i'd read watch difficult read all but perfect conditions , but i found this completely false . i've no problems whatsoever reading dial all sorts different lighting conditions . other problem i've read other reviewers concerned band , namely difficulty adjusting band band comes undone easily . while it not easiest thing , i didn't find it overly difficult adjust band . within five minutes quick look skagen website , where directions readily available , i band just right length . i also haven't any problems band coming undone it feels very secure .	1
