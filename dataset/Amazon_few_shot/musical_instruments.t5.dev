i using shure sm58 microphone over two decades live performance . it simply best affordable microphone available lead or backing vocals . it so durable , you could literally use it hammer then perform sweet ballad no ill effect . i never one break down hundreds shows . my current primary sm58 couple dents rough use rough venues but sounds just like it brand new . only reason i've ever replaced one because they stolen . if you're just starting your professional career , this microphone you need . if you're seasoned veteran music biz , you've probably already got one your gig bag . get shure sm58 , don't use some crappy thing costs half much , you won't get enough level into board . your sound guy thank you , they know just exactly what expect . any other comparable quality microphone cost you least twice much	1
