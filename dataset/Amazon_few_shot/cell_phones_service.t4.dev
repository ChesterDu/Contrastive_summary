t-mobile worst customer services . sometimes , it company mistake they still blame it customer . since i started my plan , i problem reciving my bill time . so , company start charging me $5 late fee four consecutive months . also , when i tried adding additional features such their text-message-bundle , change account not take effect till two days later , i charged 10 cents each message i used these two days , it costed me additional $4 . every time i tried complaining their customer services , they just wouldn't listen . i am starting get feeling they just trying maximize their profit . more than once , if i stay long-enough line , they put me mute so they don't listen my complaining . i feeling i am treated like dirt not like customer . i worst customer-services experience t-mobile . also , reception not best country . i friends who using same phone one i but different network , they getting services places where i don't it , they pay same amount money	-1

i've previously subscription cell phone services variety providers , but found i rarely used number minutes i paying . prepaid phone service seemed like way go , sti mobile sounded like good alternative because price competitive minutes don't expire . i signed up shortly after received my samsung phone . it arrived , however , defective - port recharging phone damaged . per sti mobile web site , i contacted them within 14 days arrange replacement phone . this resulted number email exchanges customer service . first one , rep told me i mistaken , must sent wrong charger . no offer made replace charger , strangely , which included part package deal . after additional emails where i reassured her i fact right charger ( i took phone local merchant , who showed me charger i shipped worked identical model phone - it port shipped phone defective ) . this point , rep apologized told me i would contact samsung replacement phone ! this entire process took several weeks . short , i guess you get what you pay . if i shipped working phone sti mobile probably would met my needs , but i turned off poor customer service since found prepaid phone provider	-1

this phone case worse one ever treo 650 . yea color great but , if you just tap it ground or anything color comes off wit ease . screen protector not great either . piece plastic over screen .... you lift it up so now you piece 2 cent plastic over five hundred dollar phone . not smart . now there someone who likes this cheap piece plastic over screen protect it . quote " it attaches easily i especially like screen cover - most cases don't this ( if you drop phone crack screen , you're hosed ) . " well this statement . insurance !!! if you invest five hundred dollar phone then you must insurance it . so , i guess you not hosed end . final : i am very disappointed cover recommend you invest product ( leather ) . i bought this item hoping something different . sale price really what it worth . six bucks .... $6.00 $500.00 phone .... my bad .. i really should tough this one this warning others . how cheesy ... i tough i getting deal	-1

i wouldn't buy this unless it emergency , because it one those chargers reports errors , makes your phone start beeping non-stop when it charging . i don't want this because i like charging night , other chargers don't this ( i guess what it it starts fluctuating power wall , like switching off , when battery fully charged .. so it beeps if it plugged over over ) . when i first got it , i trying carefully plug it into my phone -- i didn't want damage little metal things inside my phone or charger . it wasn't going smoothly it didn't match up or seem fit inside all . so i went day without phone i more research see why heck they'd lie it fit my phone . finally i got fed up because i couldn't find charger anywhere where i live i tried forcing it . finally it fit ! but i shove it .. who knows if it damaging my phone . but it charging so i happy ( my cell my only phone .. so i cut off world ) . then i tried getting it out couldn't figure it out ! i jimmy it off , broke off one side hooks helps it secure itself . i able put it back , finally learned routine so speak , taking it off , but it cheap . it very cheap . so , charger works , but it very hard use it isn't convenient all . i don't recommend it unless it emergency . me , it	-1

after owning 3 blackberry over years , i made switch blackjack because camera ability add memory . compared blackberry , microsoft operating system very cumbersome ( me ) somewhat frustrating set up initially . plus side , blackjack good battery life , screen excellent it best reception i've ever experienced . reason i only gave phone 2 stars because after just 3 months moderate use ink ( ie : numbers ) began wearing off keys . it point now where phone pretty much unusable , especially when it backlit . i called cingular first , who passed me samsung where , after 2 hours phone , i told my only option send phone ( my primary source communication ) their service center wait 3 weeks . my surprise , they went say , their discretion , they might also charge me repair . i've read comments these reviews people complained service i always just assumed they exaggerating but now i've encountered this , i feel it worth considering . if you're thinking blackjack , i encourage you aware , one , ink may inexplicably wear off keys , , you may well your own when it comes service . i feel it reasonable expect device expensive this remain functional least 3 months if not , company who sold it should assume responsibility making it right .	-1
i think this pretty good earpiece ... granted , i've only used one other ( it flimsy little thing came w/ my friend nokia ) , but this one far surpasses one sound quality comfort . where my friend would fall out my ear , this one ( once i got it figured out ) never comes loose . second , listening people my friend , i would turn up sound hear person well , then they sounded muffled distorted ; but my jabra i actually turn down volume my phone they sound crisp clear -- moreso than when i'm not using earpiece . finally , when my friend calls me uses her earpiece , she sounds distant muffled ; i've no complaints people i'm talking using jabra , , fact , my mom said it sounds better when i use earboom than when i don't . ear gels bit hard get used . they oddly shaped ( you see picture ) , there six them total -- three them each ear . lots reviewers complained fit comfort ear gels , while others claim these most comfortable earpieces they've used they fit perfectly ... i honesly say i've both experiences . when i first got this unit earpiece kept falling out everytime i would turn my head : * very * frustrating . i tried pushing it into my ear hard i could , i tried holding it place my hand , but only seemed defeat purpose hands-free earpiece . nothing seemed work . i thinking returning it . i thinking throwing it into traffic i-95 . then one day , somehow , i came realization you sort twist it into your ear -- little poky-out part stuck fold your ear next ear canal ( not fold top your ear ; if you it'll just pop out again) -- then * voila * it stays put . matter o ' fact , it'll stay put so well it'll little bit difficult -- even * painful* -- get out again . i imagine people different ear sizes , different patience levels , lower iqs might different experiences than my own . but all i say once i this little bugger figured out , i golden . i love this thing almost never talk phone without it . admittedly , it bit difficult get into your ear -- i'd say it takes upward 2 seconds get properly ( before you're good practiced it ) , which may not sound like lot , but it long enough not recognize somebody voice or hear first sentence they say , or whatever . * very mild * frustration . but like all things good pleasant , it takes little practice get it just right now i it so i answer phone , slip earboom my ear start conversation without missing beat . fact , i find this earpiece so comfortable i forget it until i go scratch my ear or something ! other complaint i saw here it not compatible nokia phones . fact , it even says right package it not compatible nokia . that funny , i nokia 3589i it works just fine . they make two other models earboom ( one which clearly would not worked my phone ) , both which claim nokia compatible , * neither * those works my phone ! confusing ? yes ! problem it doesn't work * all * nokia phones . while browsing store i noticed ones claimed nokia compatible list phones it works , but it didn't include mine ( it included one , numerically speaking , very close my model : 3590 ); which piqued my curiosity . so i went friendly manager store i he opened two different packages me let me test both them . one them worked , other didn't . strange part it we couldn't see visible difference two units ... then one us noticed one them jack two small black stripes around it ( that this one , if you look closely picture you see them ) , while other one ( one marked nokia compatible ) three . hmmm ... curious . so my advice either know your phone well ( , little book handy ) or ask help before purchasing . all all 4 5 stars . i'd give it 5 stars performance comfort , but take it down notch extended period getting used it confusing packaging . addendum : several months later little piece foam fallen end boom so any sound wind becomes almost unbearably loud person other end ... living windy providence , this bit annoyance . also , while i problem where earpiece would cut out seconds time so i couldn't hear person other end line ( , likewise , they couldn't hear me ) unless i jiggled little jack . this * very * frustrating . ** now , some reason , i'm not problem anymore . i'm not really sure if problem due my phone or earboom . either way , it something buyers should aware	1

i recently purchased this motorola hs805 headset find it more than adequate . price , it worth every penny . ability using aaa batteries puts it above all other headsets respect . nonreplacable rechargable batteries gimmick . once they finally die , your headset useless . too expensive send away repair . so you throw your headset charger away buy new one . good company but not you . depending your ear structure fit either formfitting or loose . reading other reviews here one infer this . me it formfitting . also you may infer bluetooth telephone or device it pairs would make difference performance . some reviewers here felt this headset low volume or allowed some static . me others , we experienced no such problem . best bet check return policy if you find it doesn't meet your standards . but if it works your device , you headset goes 16 days standby 22 hours talk time 1 aaa alkaline battery !. you never bothered charger unless you use rechargable aaa batteries which pretty good idea . if it also fits your ear comfortably then you winner	1

if you own , you know battery life standard battery horrible . this charger also slot 2nd battery , which great . so i charge my phone standard battery , extended one verizon sells back slot . never worry battery life again . also , it makes wonderful stand phone , when hooked usb cable , you get data conectivity too . only downside , it won't charge extended battery until phone fully charged .	1
