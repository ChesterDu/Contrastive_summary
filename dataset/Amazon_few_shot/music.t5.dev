man , she get anymore stupid talentless . she needs spend some undeserved bling bling some singing lessons than her skimpy outfits . all songs this album totally unlistenable ! she completely lacks power , vocal range versatility . jennifer lopez represents everything wrong music today . she gets recording contract because her good looks success her acting career . just because your great actor/actress doesn't necessarily mean you sing , too . some actors/actresses able achieve it , but not jennifer lopez . she needs quit music business while she still . please stick acting ... oh , wait ! i forgot , she can't either !	-1
it people letting their personal beliefs block receptors brain signal bad music ? ive listened many bob dylan albums , every one gem . freewheelin ' my favorite , but so what ? it doesn't matter which ones we love , because we all know what bob dylan worst record , its saved . im not one question this man beliefs or anything like , bob dylan deserves all respect universe , but could it bob dylan made transfer christian music help us all see how bad it ? could he made transfer make mockery christian faith ? almost certainly not . but only seriously bad album could planted these seeds my brain	-1

live alive good enough buy my standered ..... i really think this recorded poorly but songs it really good if you play it your car , or bigger speakers so you really hear everything much better . their many good songs included this complination live performence spanning performences montreux jazz festival , austin opera house , dallas starfest . this recordings all 85-through 86 . jimmie vaughan appears willie wimp , love struck baby , look little sister , change it playing guitar , string bass . i think worst song entire complination voodoo chile(slight return ) which kind weird me say because i think truely best song stevie ray played live but this case its not . other than i really think what it it average live performence .	-1

i wonder why robin felt need release this album . it collection bee gees songs but barry not consulted album or selections songs . robin need money he continues throw same songs out fans ? how many copies these hits we really need own ? i don't understand why some songs would even considered ' love ' songs why solo releases if it called bee gees album ? i thought cover strange it didn't contain picture bee gees , maybe because robin failed yet again consult his brother , but wants fans believe it joint effort . sorry robin , but fans know it wasn't . if barry involved , he would mentioned it his web site plus offered album fans buy . lack show barry site shows fans once again you tried mislead people just fatten your wallet . i hope all bee gees fans robin gets over his anger his big brother realizes he just isn't capable doing it his own . this album , why waste your money ! get out blank cd make your own album , i guarantee you come up better song selection look all money you saved .	-1

gershwin lived short life but pieces he made marvelous . his fusion jazz big band creates unique sound very pleasing . listening rhapsody blue , or american paris always gives feeling big bustling american city its prime , full rich color glamour . uneven , busy syncopated rythyms brass percussion add sense workaholic society america during its time . it old timely sound it all makes gershwin so songs irresistable ear . cuban overture sounds equally robust majestic , complete native cuban percussion , quot ; porgy bessquot ; suite , while operatic huge proportion , doesn't stray far its jazz roots . chicago symphony played music gusto vigor , james levine thoughtfully interpreted each piece utmost care way gershwin intended it . i highly recommend this piece anyone fine taste big band , all-american sound . all music i've heard , gershwin music sounds most american them all	1

i've always rejected term " fan " it derived creepy word fanatic so what you call someone who entire perception music changed one band one album never same , crazy ? then commit me . cheap trick debute album flew face everything wrong rock music late seventies ( frequently still ) , pompous , arrogant overblown . one fell swoop boys rockford changed all rules like sherman sea set scorched earth policy would make general proud . what said robin zanders vocals this disc , ballad tv violence he caged banshee relentlessly tearing our ear drums making us beg mercy more , while mandocello he takes us some dark melodic place shows us how feel his pain . rick nielsen master strokes song craft bone jarring riffs gave all us junior high geeks reason beleive maybe , if we ate our vegetables said our prayers , we could grow up guitar hero just like rick . ah , bun ., coolest cat behind drum kit uncanny knack impersonating sound jack hammer concrete , nuff said ! oh sweet growning moaning tom petersson twelve string bass , while rest world trouble only four strings , tom single-handedly informed wanna bass players everywhere maybe it time put damn thing away get real job . cheap trick everything right sex pistols , e.l.o. , sweet move same time made it painfully clear what they lacked , it made us realize what we missing everything else we listened . it greatest non-live , live performance ever captured tape . tunes irreverent , mind numbing , singable , screamable perfect start finish . dare yourself not sing he whore or oh , candy it just resolution you can't keep . if nasa mind shoot one cd into space representation everything right good american music this would one , who could resist higher intelligence belting out hot love ?! truth out there it cheap trick . over twenty years cheap trick reminded us it time get over ourselves little this , there very first album , they've shown us throwing caution wind little scary sometimes but it always one hell ride	1
where this one fits : slow wonder follows new pornographers ' mass romantic electric version , but precedes twin cinema . it transition frenetic power-pop first two np albums deeper , more timeless quality their latest . without burden np " sound " live up , newman stretches , writes ballads pink floyd-y space out songs ( though always concise ) , if anything gets more pet sounds-like his musical arrangements ( gorgeous trumpet " come crash , " driving , rhythmic cello " town halo " ) . newman , quite obviously , very prolific his batting average stunningly high . it okay me if he mixes solo albums his np output , using them places experiment new kinds songs he thinks maybe his np fans won't cotton . but this album full hits , just melodic just many " how he ? " high-wire assemblages melody , rhythm arrangement np delivers . if you like new pornographers , you'll joyous hearing " table , " " mystery drug , " " secretarial " my favorite " town halo . " a.c. newman rapidly becoming most valuable pop artist planet , keeper great tradition pop/rock songwriters nearly died out .	1

although new cast recording faith prince helped me understand show much better ( its surprising how song i listened this original album suddenly seen much clearer light ) . this all mostly because new recording includes dialogue leading into it ( underscoring ) . i would disagree anyone however , who said judy holliday mostly remembered her acting comedy she brings this role not her singing . her singing beautiful her emotions thorougly felt . quot ; party overquot ; amazing deserves far more credit one best score . quot;i'm going backquot ; also terrificly , her voice varies incredibly just one song . quot ; long before i knew youquot ; quot ; just timequot ; also terrific whoever it plays jeff not lack all his vocals . he sings songs so smoothly ... they just flow right him . there also great ensemble numbers quot;it simple little systemquot ; , quot ;d rop namequot ; quot ; midas touchquot ; sooo cute . i'd say if you buy this cd love it ... or already know you loves this cd ... buy new broadway recording faith prince new understanding it . although i dislike how prince sings quot ; party overquot ; ( song you go full out vocals .. she speak-sang much it ) . but course , many tracks new recording wonderful ( its lucky many original arrangements kept ) song quot ; better than dreamquot ; should listened .. i just love it i dont recall it original . anyways ... i defiently reccomend this musical listen singers out there who looking new material quot ; party overquot ; wonderful song perform	1
wow , it took quite few years cd release echelons dropped . it could not come greater time too . now , i finally keep my album echelons archive section my record rack ! debut album against channels joy division some early rem ( raido free europe days ) suggested ... i prefer see them all joy division but not too dark . although all their tracks stand-outs , it lie loud clear my most requested tracks play while i spinnin ' my college radio station .	1

i must say when i first heard " kick push " i thought myself this guy really something talk because he such metaphoric rhymer his delivery very strong so i know i buy lupe fiasco debut album " food liquor " . after listening this album beginning end i not all disappointed but indeed this album really let me know there still few rappers out there still kicking rhymes issues we deal everyday life instead hearing these other mc dont rap anything except cars , clothes , jewelry , women . i would recommend this album anyone fan real rap because this album open your eyes alot things life . my 5 favorite tracks : 1 . " cool " - this song basically young man who died(not literally ) but he able come back life try make change better but same time he chose live his life same way he lived it once before . song very metaphor deep . 2 . " he say she say " - this song little boy who doesnt visible father it affecting him deeply . 3 . " hurt me soul " - this song talks just any issue you think women degraded rap music , drug dealing , crooked cops , government not offering black people welfare overcharging healthcare , johns prostitutes . song also very nice hook . 4 . " sunshine " - this song this girl he falls love club eventhough he not looking love he cannot resist it this girl . 5 . " pressure " featuring jay-z- very nice concept it lupe standpoint eventhough im not big jay-z fan he still put down nice verse . other songs i like " just might ok " , " daydreaminin " , " kick push " , " i gotcha " , " instrumental " , " american terrorists " . i would recommend this album anyone who true fan real rap because it not disappoint you all !!!!	1

one things makes movie `marie antoinette ' so great brilliant soundtrack put together sophia coppola who i swear modern day genius . this two-disc album offers some great music just sit back enjoy , starting siouxsie banshees track `hong kong garden ' ending cure brilliant `all cat grey ' . disc one standout track whole reason i purchased this album strokes `what ever happened ' which plays one most pivotal scenes film , course track runs throughout majority trailers promoting this brilliant film . other choice tracks include both tracks radio dept ., especially `pulling our weight ' course `i want candy ' . i love new order track `ceremony ' `concerto ' . second disc full some most peaceful recordings placed together one album , aphex twin `jynweythek ylow ' `avril 14th ' standing out favorites their haunting atmosphere . dustin o'halloran `opus 17 ' just plain stunning his `opus 36 ' well . much different feel than first disc , this second album serves such delightful treat , both albums meshing perfectly together deliver one kind musical experience . worth every penny	1
amazon worst retailor buy any goblin or dawn dead music . they repeatedly told me zombi soundtrack stock . when i tried order it they told me they out stock yet their site said it stock 6 months after ! i order tower.com ( who awesome ! ) amazon not great site order i am dissapointed them . this cd so worth it , so don't discouraged this site ..... serch around if you buy it	1
i didnt most remote idea i going like this album this much . my only experience band clint eastwood recently feel good , which even though i thought it great i wasnt too crazy it . but i recently watched whole demon days album played manchester opera house ... oh man ! i totally blown away ! performance waas amazing , i totally loved songs , all energy coming stage makes you get up your feet start singing too . god ! i wish i could there ! i buy cd , love kids guns , dirty harry , last living souls . even soft mellow songs amazing . i talking friend when i started watching dvd i put phone down . if you like something different , away ordinary , catch damon albarn this time	-1

i abide amazons guidelines not criticize particular reviewer . " sinner " very few weak spots i also like contrast rockers slower songs . i especially liked re-make " 100 ft . away " . i seen joanie touring behind every album , even her first , andregardless crowd/club , she holds nothing back . high spots include " . . . " , riddles , watersign , baby blue , everyone knows , bad time . blazing guitars , signature growling vocals , ( soft/caring when necessary) -- all jett constants . i could go but there really not bummer album . if you waiting 1st-class jett album , wait no longer . wait over . frosty prim/veteran live music goe	1
i'm going critical here because all people review tend fans album their reviewing . i've got all roots albums say this middle road . i would say it first album modern roots phase where their style differs creating modern but same time retro feel bottles bells sampling . " dynamite " , " ain't sayin ' nothin new " , " love my life " " you got me " all chilled great songs but don't flow like tracks such " episodes " or " proceed " previous albums . if you like cutting edge 1999 hip hop then you love this . if you don't then you'll still like it if you open your eyes it	-1
" beatles sale " sounds very much like transitional work . though uneven terms structure ( least half tracks cover versions ) , introspective nature " i'm loser , " " no reply " " i'll follow sun " pave way greater glories . overall record would stronger if group deleted " mr. moonlight " " what you're doing " -- two obvious throwaways . still , flawed beatles album better than none	-1
i love this cd ! music wonderful reminds me particular parts movie . great movie , great soundtrack	1
how dooes one cope music so life-affirming , yet twisted fact bradley never lived see it released ? or his band literally own world shadows next year , far less talented musicians aping sublime sound commercial acclaim ? question i've wrestled nigh ten years now . sure darkness creeps " same end " " burritos " , nihilism " april 29 1992 " . light brad radiated his soul outshines every last bit it . " pawn shop " painful reminder all-too-real cost heroin addiction . can't help but wonder where they might gone next , each succesive album evolution one before . speculation pointless . legend sublime grows year year , reputation this , their final album . need pick me up bush administration depression ? listen " caress me down " harken back better days . it it all so simple	-1
i picked up this one " waiting sirens call " same time ( fingerprints " high fidelity " , long beach ) . both albums great , but krafty bending my ear toward newer release . i must drug induced haze or possibly mesmerized some chick time this record came out , because i still republic infinite repeat my cd player time i picked this up , which 06 . but wait , i don't cd player - yes , reality i republic alac format all my ipods . big personal bonus me discovering my great grandfather lived manchester , which , course , nothing way record sounds , but it my 15min so what you care . great record . thank goodness it wasn't 8 years releases again	1
after listening quot ; subversive sounds lovequot ; i realized i should've bought stock frisbie instead horrible internet company folded last month . this band combination intelligent , inspiring , soulful lyrics outstanding musicianship truly classic harmonies . no need compare frisbie beatles , eagles , styx , byrds , or america - they're class all themselves	1
first off , ignore everyone says aly aj just spawn off disney entertainment congolmerate . though one sisters , aly , started her mainstream career disney channel tv show " phil future " then created this album her sister amanda , you should know these girls involved world music since very young age . unlike some disney spawns who just randomly decide " hey , i think i want sing " , aly aj their time coming . they writing songs since very young age . fact , all but 3 songs album written or co-written them . you should probably know i am 21 years old , way outside target demographic , but changing . i first exposed their music when my sister dragged me disneyland last august see them perform live . like most , i pre-conceived image my head disney girls gone singers . boy i wrong . first i ever heard them " rush " live , followed some more songs off album . i so impressed i bought original copy cd almost instantly . i myself seen them perform live 6 times well met them , i honestly say they real . live performances no pre-recorded or lipsynched elements it . they real stage . guitars played , songs sung , it sounds beautiful . it shame recent times , many idols their target teenage girl fallen victim presentation rather than talent . i say , more talent you , better presentation given anyways . note : even if you original copy " into rush " , i highly recommend buying upgrade . i already owned original , well japanese import i didn't hesitate one moment buy deluxe edition . if anything song " chemicals react " worth it . when song first debuted , it totally blew me away . other new song " shine " also one their amazing surprises . though not my favorite ( but far my least favorite ) song , i felt like this song sort like dipping their feet into pool before diving . way gauge response somewhat different style see if they want keep steering direction . i say go i t.t he remixes " something more " " collapsed " also give new feel album . " something more " feels more hard than its original counterpart . more agressive chords , lively beats used chorus well throughout song . pretty good margin , i admit " collapsed " improved quite bit . i already huge fan song before , but this remixed version gives new meaning song . it starts out roughly same , but soon after pseudo 80 style band backs up vocals instead more hardcore sound original . i love diversity song well unorthodox-ness whole layout song . if you too lazy read whole review just read this . buy albu	1
enjoying my purchase lot ; takes me " back day . " arrived timely , good repair . would order you again	1
i like these songs . 1993 these versions songs eagles released benefit preservation land around walden pond . country singers usually good picking up enough way song should it right . almost all these songs so familiar most audiences would know if rendition started fall apart , but all these performances so polished anyone would thrilled hear them . i only know greatest hits songs eagles concert , but final song , quot ; sad cafequot ; only selection this cd i not heard often enough know how it really goes , all songs sound right . i'm inclined pay more attention female vocalists than other kind , i'm glad some ladies got longer songs this cd , `take it limit , ' ( 4:32 ) `new kid town , ' ( 5:07 ) `already gone , ' ( 5:00 ) `the sad cafe ' ( 4:45 ) . four songs guys sing less than 3 or 4 minutes , but longest song `lyin ' eyes ' ( 6:30 ) diamond rio looks like bunch guys picture : lead vocals : marty roe , gene johnson dana williams background vocals . there some great lines eagles ' songs i like , when i could not remember final verse one those songs , today , this cd obvious pick listen because these singers not afraid clearer than originals . my mind digresses too much when listening songs everyone heard millions times , especially time song gets guitar solo , singer giving some country character these songs makes words stand out more than ever . if you ever appreciated songs eagles but got tired listening original versions , this cd give you 13 great songs all variety mainstream country music fans expect	1

many us " boomers " jackson browne one voices we hear our sleep , part sound track runs behind our lives , especially while we try figure out how we got where we which sometimes long way idealism we espoused those early formative days . solo acoustic , me , brings all home . here mature-voiced icon singing banner songs . here clean , crisp guitar work incredibly lean lush piano , distinctive its theatricality . like mark knopfler signature sound , when jackson starts playing , we know who it . multiple tunings , guitars voiced one song only , different sizes shapes , carefully chosen fit words melody , this more than craftsman-like , this song-writing performance taken new level , which i am grateful . some reviewers noted , only problem here there only 12 songs we hope vol . 2 way . also , some introductions less than helpful several aren't all interesting . only couple give some insight song follows . vol . 2 , take out commentary leave it studio ( unless it help us understand music ) give us instead two or three more songs	-1
i divide albums into three categories : 1 ) decent tunes , 2 ) songs listen while washing dishes 3 ) pure junk . mclachlan no " pure junk " here except maybe " ice cream " or whatever it called . but decent tunes category there only couple cuts which , example , you might want turn friends onto : " mary " " possession " . " good enough " " fumbling towards ecstacy " pass . these only songs hooks . rest songs nothing unless you just want hear pretty voice . i love her voice like wash dishes while listening it hooks or not . if you're obsessed sarah mclachlan then you would probably give five stars recording her singing ingredients label package cookies so read reviews fans who not obsessed	-1
don't get me wrong , i love brian stokes mitchell . his deep voice intoxicating beautiful , which why this cd such dissapointment . all his songs high not show off his wonderful low voice . mitchell should stick what he best it not covers songs made tenors . i hope his next album more fit his voice , i'll first line	-1

this cd incredible ride back memory lane ! listening this reminds me sitting math class , cyphers lunch just really loving hiphop , far cry way i feel it now . most other reviews summed up nicely how important this anthology culture tribe incredible influence mcs . you can't help but hear phife when you hear talib kweli just one example . but there one other thing no one touched . see much this cd reminds me high school , i still playing low end theory 3 years later college when diamond psychotic neurotics dropped ' stunts , blunts , hip hop ' classic . i still playing it because it hot just timeless . how many cds you say these so-called ' hiphop ' artists , you play something 3 years later it still feels good ? that what makes it real music , its timeless 10+ years later this entire anthology could keep real hiphop purist party jump all night , just keep it repeat .	1
robben ford " supernatural " now 5 years old certainly aging well . my favorite track bluesy " nothing nobody .

" " water wicked " co-written doobie brothers ' michael mcdonald plenty blue-eyed funk soul .

i must say i not like victory records . all . publicity they give their bands disgusting , lines like " pantera gone , metallica old " similar selling points bands just don't deliver ( see sinai beach , atreyu , etc ) . then , these bands forgotten label finds bands they think better than others continue this lame publicity stunt . mind you , victory records few acceptable bands , such euro-influenced darkest hour , goth stylings aiden , band i'm reviewing here , incredibly thrashy buried me . it my heart good see band actual talent make it big label respected ( misled youth , perhaps ) big victory records . when all others fail any staying power , btbam contains winning formula keeps you listening start finish . although , even greatest bands its flaws , all covered this review . let break it all down . lead vocalist/keyboardist tommy rogers quite versatile voice , able comfortably switch deep , guttural growling powerful screams soft , melodic singing , all while keeping soothing ambience his keyboard ( least during soft parts ) . his voice perfectly attuned music keeps purpose music his angry/loving/pseudo-poetical lyrics . lead guitarist paul waggoner above-average guitarist metalcore band this type , compelling , highly technical solos here there some heavy riffing fellow guitarist shane brown . together they put together some thrashy , dense riffs . while bass lines kevin falk aren't very audible amongst monstrous noise rest band , he few brief moments glory show he decent bassist . lastly drummer terry jason roe , who impressive skill pushing out some driving double-bass riffs without compromising his drum style , which impeccable . one few flaws this album repetition ; first three songs blend together into one long song , three songs middle break up monotony some soft acoustic numbers which seem rather long , then heaviness continues like it various interludes . while it sounds rather unfulfilling first listen , album grows you when you learn appreciate what it offer . bottom line : definitely better than most what victory records puts out market , strangely enough one least publicized their roster . if you're fan mathcore or metal general , you'll probably find something this album you like . this album brings shining ray hope hopeless genre . track selections : " lost perfection : coulrophobia " , " mordecai , " " ad dglgmut " 8/1	-1
like many other people my age , i slowly steadily replacing my old cd , originally issued back late 80 early 90 , newly " remastered " versions . i am audiophile , so good sound very important . most remasters bargain ! you get updated sound , new liner notes , unreleased photos , bonus tracks , etc . this 30th anniversary edition steve miller fly like eagle one best ! you get exactly what anyone would expect " special editon " remaster . updated sound quality , bonus tracks ( 3 ) , bonus dvd nice interview steve miller making of/recording fly like eagle ( 30 minutes ) modern performance steve his current bandmates recorded last year ( 2005 ) that over 2 hours long ! don't let other very picky reviewer sway you so called " poor quality " dvd . it not horrible ! what these people failed realize dvd not planned , it just happened , when steve miller himself saw it , he thought it captured " magic " one their better shows . so it decided it would released . dvd simply recording projection screen images used during their concert . i very happy see this classic album finally given updated , newly remastered treatment . it one best special edition packages i bought . let just hope book dreams gets same level attention their next release . would great	1
good " let me go " starts off beautiful string introduction abruptly switches in-your-face vocal . wetton still melodic touch , while downes carries him his pulsating key strokes . their harmonics spot-on . you tend think this song getting out bad relationship , but two commented it getting out record contract . " god walks us " inspirational ballad faith . wetton flexes his powerful pipes confidence conviction . added pan flute piano only enhance track . it sure jerk emotion or two out you . wetton downes keep spirituality theme going " i stand alone " . welcoming church organ section gives way driving aor rocker .

" comets fire dense . blue cathedral punishing wall noise . listening it i felt like one those explorers black white tarzan movies equipped machete inching through foliage . however , once you carved out your own path album rewarded you tenfold . comets unapologetically classic rock , but instead just breaking out old hendrix painting numbers they added some proto-punk echoplex . some thought blue cathedral more attitude than it songwriting , them avatar perfect rebuttal . here faces riffs robert plant vocals slowed down further reveal songs point where someone who hated blue cathedral might actually like avatar . don't worry , there still use echoplex , songs drawn six eight minutes length ( one exception ) , but comets traded some their feral energy more dynamic sound . benefiting most new dynamics bad acid sounding " lucifer memory , " song sounds like flower wilting . there certain cadence plugs chugging vocals pushing song towards its seven minute mark . it quickly become my favorite new song this year . while there still some rockers , such opener " dogwood rust " which sounds if its beginning should found somewhere before you pressed play , just closer sounds if it ends before song stopped , even these rockers sound less brutal than their predecessors . only " holy teeth " same long-haired head banging attitude blue cathedral , it only lasts three minutes ( only minute comets fire time ) . almost nine-minutes " soup smoke " pushes limits pseudo-tribal beats . instead punishing noise comets pounding repetition into our heads . just thirteen more seconds i think i would spiritual vision . only six minutes long closer " hatched upon age " proves it takes more than just length epic more than just noise crescendo . miracle album through all interplay instruments sometimes it just couple simple repetitive piano keys bring it all home . avatar easily one best releases ' 06 . very few bands bring me back feeling i got discovering classic rock bands middle school . but don't break out your eight tracks dust off old bong yet . unlike most bands , retro only half story comets fire . comets fire ultimately timeless . try i might , i cannot lump them all other seventies rockers , but their sound hardly seems contemporary . it if they've found some time wormhole so they rock across ages . i'm there , man , i'm there	1

i am huge garth fan , i all albums six his live concerts . i like pieces because song " red strokes " i don't really like music video it because i think garth could better what use video instead just red paint white room , because just thoes two things just scary when put together . but , i like song because it talks mainly love what color heart , he potrays it alot two people painting picture heart color they use alot red . he even talks how when your blue , color your heart blue when your jeleous your heart green . but when you love , your heart really red . general , pieces one garths better albums .	1

i caught act tour intrigued . i'll confess my favorite costello long " get happy " so this right down my alley . nevertheless , i'm so impressed toussaint compositions arrangements i need catch up his previous records . this funky very hooky record , well executed costello imposters . costello amazing artist who seemingly try literally anything . he wonderful thing here , bringing toussaint some well-deserved notoriety , scoring couple moral political points title track " broken promise land . " while neither those songs sublime best toussaint songs this record , they tie it back katrina disaster which brought artists back together . my early favorite costello composition this " ascension day " cowritten toussaint featuring just voice piano .	1
some may consider my review heavily biased , since i've huge jada fan since lox days , but i believe this album deserves more shine than its gotten . my opinion huge improvement over first album , cuts like " why " " air it out " really shows jada improvement his lyrical content . like first album , its still very much streets , but same time it now crossover commercial appeal well , without too corny like many other artists nowadays . even more , some cuts actually address viable social issues unlike 90% gangsta rap nowadays . jada his finest	1

i greatly admire pinnock style , directing skill harpsichord playing , but i don't understand variability sound balance achieved his many recordings dg . most recorded henry wood hall same " tonmeister " producers . example his recording bach violin concertos vibrant , full bodied great " presence " , whereas other end spectrum , last disc symphonies , 40 41 , really anemic , pratically no bass . i gave them +12db bass boost try compensate lack bass , but there hardly any difference low end response . order listen this disc , some extent prior two well , i reverted my volume expander used vinyl records 70 . my system very clean deep bass response handles telarc organ recordings great effect , so i not believe it . , i stated violin concertos great presence , point where i visualize bass cello players bowing their instruments . it may different microphone placement larger ensemble latter symphonies , without compensating different acoustic . when it comes archiv 4d recordings english concert , i not like them all . choir mozart coronation mass sounds like it piped down outer space , detached way ethereal . telemann suites not fare any better , thin anemic . don't think extended dynamic range lower threshold noise level helped any way . i should also add i every recording pinnock english concert , really best " original instruments group " out there . my humble opinion , pinnock should " sir " front his name	-1
i've listening ed harcourt since i recieved " here monsters " promotional disc 4 years ago , bought every album since . ed harcourt one best musical talents new millenium , sadly , yet find any sort recognition us . unlike " strangers " , where he tried his hand few poppier tunes , ed finds himself back where he started embraces his dramatic flair turning out very complete utterly satisfying album . like " here monsters " , ed orchestrates elaborate ballads complete horns strings , maintains his brooding style even his most upbeat songs resulting perhaps his most well rounded mature sounding album yet . he takes his songs all right directions , strays pitfalls predictable songwriting keeping his sound fresh giving album incredible replay value . " beautiful lie " like good novel all its chapters joined unifying theme . each song flows first last leaves you wanting replay album soon it finished . if i pick favorite song( -- seriously -- every song great)i would probably pick one " shadowboxing " / " until tomorrow then " /or " good friends hard find " . every track ed harcourt emotes his lyrics genuine passion binds his words his music together paint images sometimes haunting sometimes whimsical , yet always sincere . this his best work definitely deserves much more attention than its going get	1
this full-length concert recording contains several high points few stretches where program seems sag . disc 1 pleasant stew " new " material old standbys like " china cat sunflower " " truckin ' . " audience mildly rude when it not inert . this disc seems go forever , impatience reaching its apogee during weir rendition " me bobby mcgee . " disc 2 kicks off great pigpen showpiece , rascals ' " good lovin ' , " which becomes unrecognizable when pigpen band start funk it up . then nice long " casey jones " closes first set . second set actually begins disc 3 monster " dark star " everyone raved here . much spacier also busier than live/dead version , it ventures way , way out begins break apart when suddenly we're listening brisk version john phillips ' " me my uncle . " song ends loud resounding chord , inciting 15 or 20 minutes gassy " dark star " stuff . second " dark star " first don't really fuse together very well because second grows out preceding song - it doesn't pick up where first " dark star " left off . then , into " wharf rat " solid " sugar magnolia " close second set . sincere applause cheers audience now ! back disc 2 third set , which seems gratuitous light preceding hour fireworks . pleasant performances " he gone " " el paso , " then disc 3 again solid medley " not fade away " " going down road feeling bad " end show . ( encore , " one more saturday night , " glibly introduced " our latest single " which bob weir asks audience go out purchase . ) all , good reflection grateful dead this juncture their career - serving up generous heap mid-tempo americana-type songs , not skimping hallucinogenic bread butter distinguished dead their peers . this not ideal uninitiated - hundred year hall , same tour , more concisely edited version dead europe ' 72 show , europe ' 72 kind " greatest hits " this tour really can't beat - though it lacks 60-minute " dark star .	-1

cd arrived just otherday i'm glad it . those who like techno music , this ones you . it reminds me days back ' 80 when jan hammer(miami vice fame ) hot item .

surprisingly quiet moving score historical wartime epic , quot ; patriotquot ; begins aching solo violin , segues into fifes drums rich brasses williams so often uses , goes through 17 gently throbbing tracks heavy sense time place invoked . once again you wonder how one man immerse himself so thoroughly so many environments , distant deep-space culture quot ; star warsquot ; this thoroughly earth-grounded tale reluctant warrior , make music simultaneously unique each recognizably his own . this not so much music thrill , reflect -- perhaps good cd turntable you look through your latest book heroes 9/11	1

if you're reading this , you already know who neal . i listening neal close thirty years now , i my favorites , like everyone else . what you gotta realize neal shines brightest when he playing searing melodic solos over top melodic music . i love schon/hammer stuff , really love early journey stuff ( think quot ; spacemanquot ; off quot ; nextquot ; album ) , course santana , but c'mon , guys-his most consistently great melodic playing first bunch journey albums w/steve perry ; up time gregg rolie left band . reason because he playing top some really rich songwriting . i think his playing since those days great , there moments brilliance , but overall , blues stuff solo albums don't imho showcase his best attribute , truly genius sense melody . this release blows me away . songs some these reviewers think cheesy one thing common- they great songs . they sound 1000% better neals soulfully crisp tones icing them down . i think it took lot guts ( jeff beck type guts ) his part release this , i'm glad he . i haven't heard him play this good years	1
i've never understood slagging this album got most but not all quarters . its peaks outstrip anything face dances or new , truly lame endless wire ( pete lost his melodic muse , i'm afraid ) , compares very well who numbers who you ? some songs stand townshend best , including athena , known no war , one life enough , utterly amazing why i fall ?, which simply one best townshend songs who performances . entwistle turns some his best writing band well , it your turn dangerous . yes , there few turkeys ( cook county , one day time , excrable eminence front ) , but great songs make it worthy who album , imo	-1
read only moments ago , lee passing , i instantly thought back first time i heard blistering proto-punk " 7 7 " thingking how cool song , but not realizing just how groundbreaking record . unlike any band before them , especially multi-racial unit , love fused wildly disparate influences ( hard rock , folk , flamenco orchestral pop)to forge something entirely new mid late 60 while they never achieved any major chart success , thier influence still felt heard today . arthur lee also scores major cool points essentially introducing jac holzman music jim morrison doors getting them signed elektra records . while " da capo " widely criticized unjustly maligned only ' half great lp ' , ( 19 minute jam comprises side 2 indulgent but not nearly horrid some claimed ) music here still sounds fresh exciting instantly remind listeners what enormous talent we lost . music world just got little less colorful	-1

i strong sarah mclachlan fan up until she released surfacing . now , i like surfacing , but i felt it inferior her earlier albums . then , she took long break , like so many others , i thought " great ! she rested blow us all away ! " wrong , afterglow worst all sarah albums . it unimaginative , boring not musically solid fumbling towards ecstasy , touch solace . case point , last song album , dirty little secret , actually painful listen me . it awkward musically -- choppy discordant -- lyrically it only slightly better than britney spears ' attempt song writing , dear diary ( don't bother listening song -- it trash ) . said all , i like some songs afterglow : stupidfallendriftingthis just not justified purchase ( not mention justified wait 5 years ) . it almost like she realized some point , " oh wait ! i music career , don't i ? i better put something out quick so i support my family . " if i you , i would pick up her first three albums maybe surfacing ( it least better than afterglow )	-1
i think every great band moment time . david bowie its ziggy . beatles-white album , floyd-dark side moon . i felt green day their masterpiece american idiot . when all tracks perfect . no bad songs skip over when band just seems perfect unison . this cd mcr . its remarkable such young band . maybe it too soon it even . but it out there there no turning back now . this cd excellent . yes you feel so many influences , but all good ones my book ! this might hard follow up , toughest part this band . how you top this ? if you haven't experienced this cd , please . all these positive reviews must mean something ! i it home , car while working my computer . which how i felt american idiot . bravo mcr making music means so much so many . thanks your hard work . now start american tour already !!!!!	1

those you who frequently dislike glass work , don't too quick judge this one . those who love his work , prepare pleasantly surprised . glass taken healthily large step outside his esteemed minimilism style brought wonderful score fits movie perfectly . while maintaining his personal touch composer his repeated arpeggios , complex rhythmic metrical elements brilliant use or orchestration , he manages weave colorful melodies dramatic builds , after seen movie , i could not imagine any other composer providing well adept or fitting score . quite possibly one his best works date i cannot stress enough how perfect it this movie	1

this cd spellbinding rhythms more ethereal tracks - kind relatively slow-paced tracks artfully establish early ' moment connection music ' somehow liberates listeners soul artist vision behind musical track comes life we transported place . whole it unique blend familiar exotic - ethereally exotic rhythms wedded lucidly logical melodic lines . this often-tried experiment , here , quite successful . other tracks high energy - very inspired , all infused brilliant , pleasingly-structured , readily-identifiable sense jazz fusion . stylistically this may ponty singularly most cohesive work . given his output , spans well beyond his most prolific stint during 1970 ' 80 , may well saying something . i haven't heard everything him , but , if your looking something else , imho , gives " cosmic messenger " run it money , may i suggest " mystical adventures " - knockout his . if you look it like i , unresolved toss-up this magnitude nothing but blessing music fans general , fans jazz fusion particular or anyone curious know just what five string electrified violin . i also enjoy " taste passion " , " civilized evil " " enigmatic ocean " . any case , ponty arguably world champion five string electrified violin . not this instrument only feature merit album . ponty , this time frame , surrounds himself truly comparable talent percussion , incredible electric bassist , here , two superb lead guitarists . i don't truly know myself yet if this jean-luc ponty best album , but , so far , i say it my favorite . highly , highly recommended	1
cream blues band first , pretty durned good one . i feel free n.s.u don't really demonstrate band blues side , but they rightful psychadelic cream classics . blues kicks sleepy time time , pretty good original pales comparison some blues covers ( more those later ) . dreaming never ceases annoy me , so i skip it all time . but sweet wine isn't only ginger baker finest cream composition mile , but also one cream better tracks . spoonful ... all i say this one , " whoa . " six-and-a-half minute voodoo blues -- jack bruce sounds positively creepy , even laughing evily one point -- some great harpwork firey guitar playing midsection . if this isn't cream best tune , i don't know what . rollin ' tumblin ' excellent harp playing but annoying singing , cat squirrel dull , four till late forgettable . these other three bad tracks . i'm so glad totally mindless , but benefits ginger baker madman drumming . closing album out would toad , favorite mine . it pretty much drum showcase , baker pounding his drums like he caveman or something . necassary all cream fans , or blues fans general	-1

thin , reedy , weak voice caterwauling caterwauling nonetheless . finally , production adds some much needed depth masculinity this girl-pop trio . let face it , vocals this group previous outings spears-esque , or madonna-lite-like best . try they might , these ladies could never match dalle or love or hynde . but fridmann saved day injecting interesting set distorted textures saved these ladies themselves . this their only worthwhile record , man it good one	-1

there many albums which introduced new combined style music masses ( e.g. " you experienced " , " sargent peppers " , " johnny winter " " texas flood " some ) . this set way ahead its time . butterfield blues band made name itself their first , self-titled , lp great exponents revived blues power . edge this band , say unlike canned heat , they two black musicians howlin wolf band . sam lay , drummer , still considered one best chicago blues drummers ever bassist jerome arnold . this lineup impressive . unlike john mayall , whose album fired interest blues far side atlantic its pre-hendrix like overdriven sound up front guitar . however , pbbb people chicago , home urban blues , who grown up played all greats . butterfield , originally flutist , probably , charlie musselwhite , greatest ever white harp player-his style single note playing ( listen record ) very unique gives it true horn sound . he met elvin bishop university chicago started jamming . bishop , native oklahoman , blues fanatic start . he played traditional blues styles his gibson 335 freddie king , eddie taylor , luther tucker otis rush tradition . mike bloomfield , whose father owned club chicago , only playing 10 years when he made this record . he played jazz , blues fingerpicking styles well . mike took up slide fender telecaster became known around town his fabluous technqiue-similar elmore james . he hired play slide initial album " shake your moneymaker " joined band . ( however , he out whole time-i saw pbbb several times growing up ny bloomfield never line up ) . east-west bloomfield switched gibson les paul ( like clapton ) history made . his lines clear many his runs virtually seamless . amazing effort-one he himself never duplicated- like eric clapton bluesbreakers first lp . mark naftalin great job keyboards . jerome arnold plays bass soul ( especially notice his work " work song " similar duck dunn mgs ) . this band interracial , great thing blues revival they helped start ( like srv 1980s ) . they blues booker mgs . this set combines all genres music but basically shows world what willie dixon always said " blues roots , everything else fruits ! " . they impressive updated ( time ) versions many types tunes . " walking blues " course robert johnson tune probably because clapton " ramblin my mind " mayall lp . " mary , mary " tune monkees !!!!!! you believe it ! " i got mind give up living " b.b. king tune ( redone many times many different titles ) . which me always highlight record . it blues , but new wave type feel arrangement . butterfield sings , but plays no harp ! bloomfield produced his best ever blues solos- slightly understated perfect , especially intro .

behind " master puppets . " i could never get enough first four tunes here since album 1984 release bit disappointed group released new mix " fade black . " ( they should left alone . ) " fight fire fire " thrash-metal fave still rocks over twenty years later . what amazing fact band didn't suffer creative burnout after releasing this gem but , instead , churned out album introspective heavy-hitters " master puppets " mere two years later ( shorter album consisting covers : " 5.98 ep - garage days revisited " ) . they would continue " ... justice all " 1988 hit their stride so-called " black album " 1991 before going downhill - letting their fame go their heads ( sometimes i wish they would never agreed make videos . perhaps they would remained bit more level-headed ) . my personal gripe aside , discard what corporate radio deems suitable you listen metallica-wise run , don't walk , your nearest ( chain ) record store buy this gem . then yourself favor listen this masterpiece , making sure push " repeat " button cd player because once not enough . - donna di giacom	1

hank williams arguably all-time best american singer-songwriter he sings his songs better than anybody else . said , it interesting see what several modern singers collection hank songs . i think two interpretations outstanding . emmylou harris splendid " alone forsaken . " she turns song into folk tune merrie olde england tasty tuneful backing mike henderson mandolin mark knopfler guitar . i also thought keith richards ' tortured eccentric interpretation " you win again " better than good -- although i concede point reviewer jerry lee lewis song even better . tom petty , sheryl crow , lucinda williams also sing songs well . hell , hank songs so good anyone could sing them sound pretty good . smallchief	1
despues de lanzar el sobresaliente " all things must pass " el exito rotundo de " concert bangladesh " en el madison square garden , george harrison lanza este disco que en mi opini�n personal , es una excepcional saga despues de esos discos . partiendo con el gran exito " give me love " , que es un tema muy espiritual emocional de parte de george . " sue me , sue you blues " es una critica muy fuerte la situacion de beatles , pero pienso que principalmente se refiere paul mccartney ; tal vez esta cancion podria haber sido polemica junto " too many people " de mccartney " how you sleep " de lennon . " light lighted world " , " who see it " , " day world gets ' round " , " here now " " all " , tal vez sean muy parecidas entre si , pero esta la belleza solidez de george , principalmente en sus espirituales letras . " living material world " es como una especie de humorada que harrison lo hace magistralmente con su slide guitar con un destacado saxo de jim horn . " don't let me wait too long " " lord loves one " , son temas que perfectamente podr�an haber sido sencillos , principalmente la primera que es una balada melancolica muy pegajosa . " try some , buy some " , muchos diran que es el tema mas debil del disco , creo que todo lo contrario , tiene excelentes arreglos cambios de notas musicales muy complejas , con una solida produccion de phil spector . en cuanto los bonus tracks , est� " deep blue " ( lado del single " bangladesh " ) de 1971 " miss o'dell " ( lado del single " give me love " ) , que son excelentes canciones , principalmente la �ltima , que tiene un sonido country-folk lo bob dylan . la remasterizacion de este disco es fresco , limpio nitido con un espectacular sonido , en comparacion con la edicion de 1991 de parlophone que suena muy pobre . al final , creo que este es un disco que obligatoriamente tiene que estar en la discografia solista de harrison , junto " all things must pass " " cloud nine " . rating : 5 estrella	1
absolutely great ! album sade you shouldn't miss . flow , all our love , sweetest gift my favourite ! can't stop listening it . she just knows how make me feel so good	1

when i first heard commissioned child , i found their sound strange unique . however it subconciously left impression me . years later , i rediscovered this dynamic group release their reunion album ( i pleasantly surprised learn fred hammond part this group . he one my favorite gospel artists ) . it great seeing them all together matching faces names voices . they performed many songs i liked past , i surprised they ones sung them . after hearing reunion album , i grew more interested commissioned , soon started started buying their early albums . music took while grow me , but it , soon i looking more . i started looking albums contained hits performed reunion concert , hits such " let me tell it " , " secret place " , " please you more " , " i can't live without you . " i recently bought " state mind " , i got hear " i am here " ( original beautiful ) , " let me tell it " , " everlasting love . " i also bought " time seasons " few weeks later , it interesting hear how they changed over years but their message still same . i particularly like way they seamlessly combine scriptures their songs . they truly anointed lord . songs this album didn't affect me quite way previous ones , but i believe it only matter time . i particularly like " testify " , " psalms 84 " , " clean heart " ( i kept playing one over over ) , " walk right . " this their last studio album , their music blessing 20 years . i like commissioned i hope they're not group . it would nice if they release new studio album their 20th anniversary , but i know it must lord timing , so i am willing wait longer if necessary	-1

meat loaf legendary songwriter jim steinman collaborated 70s produce ground-breaking album " bat out hell " , 1993 produce follow-up " bat out hell ii " . , several other albums released , these more obscure albums still managed produce some memorable songs . this great double-cd collection contains all meat loaf most memorable songs , including " paradise dashboard light " , " bat out hell " , " modern girl " , " i would anything love " , " i'd lie you ( that truth ) " . steinman superior songwriting shines through , meat loaf trademark rock opera sound various instrumentals backing vocals evident each song . although steinman didn't write songs many meat loaf post- " bat out hell " albums , songs these albums contained this collection very good . i've fan meat loaf many years , i am eagerly anticipating release " bat out hell iii " , due out soon . meantime , meat loaf fans truly enjoy this great collection his most memorable hits	1
it finally came . took long enough , but i got it . i'm listening it right now . gutterflower 2002 studio album release goo goo dolls . what my take ? opener , " big machine " , easily one best , most explosive tracks goo goo dolls ever cut . i'm fairly well familiar song , i've downloaded it previously ( itunes ) , but it worth noting it still awesome . it guy who fallen hopelessly apathetic girl who destroying her life through her carelessness , should expected johnny rzeznik , it lyrically honest edge . " think me " all right . because it rzeznik , it head-and-shoulders above your average alternative rock , but it doesn't really stand out brilliant song . third song , " here gone " , i also downloaded listened previously . " big machine " , it still great i think i appreciate it even more now . johnny rzeznik proves he might best vocalist modern top 40 music lyrics quite affecting , even if subject matter nothing new ( girl closes off because past relationship crash , guy tries keep things together somehow ) . " you never know " features robby takac vocals therefore almost unbearable . when johnny rzeznik good he , why can't he sing all band material ? takac isn't too bad when he doing backup vocals , dizzy up girl " bullet proof " , but lead ... he terrible . truly . " what scene " rocker number works well ; gutterflower thankfully full these . it pretty solid song , i enjoy it fair bit . drummer mike malinin shines here ; percussion section very well . then comes " up , up , up " , terribly regrettable takac song , but still better than most his other lead-vocal tracks somehow ( very least ; doesn't say much ) . he doesn't too poorly bass here , though . " it over " very cynical title , you might noticed , lyrics hopeless : after breakup , girl moves guy desperate still needs her . again , despite cliche , rzeznik cuts through it well-crafted honesty his message . that probably why i like this band so much . then there acoustic song , " sympathy " , also downloaded track probably best song album . addition it one best damn music videos i've ever seen , it great song thought-provoking lyrics interpreted multiple ways . way i look it narrator trying fit crowd , or certain person - rzeznik , probably his now-ex-wife - pretending someone he not , now he agonizing over what he given up fake different life , he sorry , but he just can't anymore because it all lie . sympathy strange , though , because he breaking away ... that not bad thing . he realizing he can't live like it time change , he doesn't need sympathy people or person he pretended order get them . " what you need ? " underrated uptempo , aggressive rzeznik tune . lyrics suggest fragmented relationship made desperation , such relationships wont , now falling apart because high tensions emotions . gutterflower very bleak album beneath sheen , owing johnny rzeznik problems his former marriage - it seems emotional catharsis this way , which makes it seem all more honest actually focused . third takac song , " smash " , would pretty good if he wasn't singing it . unfortunately , he . fourth last takac song , unfortunately placed directly after " smash " ( also takac ) , could not redeemed anything save perhaps vocals steve perry , elton john , or phil collins , who seem able sing anything without making it sound lyrically awkward . worst song album . " truth whisper " closes out gutterflower less musically intense level than way " big machine " opens it . it not all catchy , but it all right malinin some nice cymbals going here . it may grow me ; many initially unassuming goo goo dolls songs tend . overall , not good 1998 instant classic dizzy up girl or 2006 let love , but fairly solid offering nonetheless , marred ( always ) voice robby takac cropping up little too often ( one song = too often ) . i already three best songs my hard drive , but it good other songs like " what scene " " what you need ? " album itself	-1
i first came into contact jim malcolm songwriting via poozies ' rendition quot ; neptunequot ; sublime infinite blue album . my first impression it beautifully worded -- lyrics song could read poetry , so facile flow words so lovely imagery -- poozies ' combination moving , melodic arrangements kate rusby melancholy voice gave me very good impression song . so i started listen jim malcolm own recordings , his writing rohallion not disappoint . man sure way words , his melodies strong . however , album hasn't touched me same way poozies track -- malcolm low , even voice lacks dramatic flair , his arrangements rarely build any kind emotional surge , resulting expertly constructed tracks somewhat flat , little too laid back my taste . i still love way he puts together song , however	-1
fratres my favorite this cd . it so crisp , so cutting , so absolutely gorgeous it nearly makes me cry every time i hear it . i used hate violin music . i guess i'm getting old , ( i'm 21 ) because this stuff just absolutely cuts my heart . it not overly complicated music mushes around , it like bared knife , simply elegantly lifting out your innards , higher , domain . buy this cd	1

... but every now then there spark something truly great , cheyenne kimball , if she learns lessons debut album well , should bright future world pop/rock music . based merits first two tracks alone ( " intro " " i want " essentially blend together into one pretty wild tune ) , cheyenne knows far more blending harmonies than most wannabees display half dozen albums . this isn't say day come perfect debut ; 13 tracks , " intro , " " i want , " " hello goodbye , " " breaking your heart , " " full circle " real standouts ... remainders certainly solid performances but they " there , " pop quality that hard dismiss . however , cheyenne definitely future world music , after listening this first adventure hers , i'm definitely interested watching what come up'n'coming on-the-edge-of-rock songbird	-1

i recommend this album those curious magnetic fields but intimidated sprawl ( cost ) quot ; 69 love songsquot ; . quot ; charmquot ; warm , yet detached , study country idiom evokes constant loss loneliness transient lifestyle . music composed unique creative synthetic textures cast over common chord progressions , listener familiar country music 60s 70s recognize many familiar melodies themes . vocals reminiscent dispassionate ian curtis or johnny cash . i no qualms calling quot ; charmquot ; essential magnetic fields recording -- i bought this album 1995 not exhausted it yet	1
when i ripped these cd put them my computer listened them , my heart sank . first , sound so incredibly loud , comparison other cd , one turn down stereo significantly even carry conversation . led me run files through what called wave editor , which shows digital files viewable format . what i saw confirmed what i heard . all tracks recorded zero decibles , maximum any digital sound file . if it louder than , sound clipped there modest significant distortion . i may getting too technical you guys , but old days we vu meter sound could crest into red ( above 0db ) ok -- not digital music . above 0db , file portions simply not heard . 80% music each track file 0db . simplify this you quiet portions each track louder portions each track compressed so each approaches or exceeds 0db . what i saw sounds tha instead peaking or approaching 0db well above value . so instead good zig zag file pattern , one sees big blot red . when i went back listened sections above 0db , you could hear noticeable clipping distortion . lowering volume using any digital sound editor certainly makes cd set more listienable , but not remove distortion clipping . high compression mastering 0db now mistake some cd mastering plants doing . i'm not sure why . audioslave red hot chili peppers two other examples artists doing this make sound appear punchier . sound standpoint , this set sucks . rip capitol vinyl versions or buy japanese versions , both which give you more honest sound greatest rock group ever . i am so disappointed this set .	-1
only just discovered this band i am very impressed . i love this type music after listening this album i can't understand why i only just come across them i wish i could found them earlier ! music classy classic but still very modern you tell how much these guys love playing this stuff i only imagine how much fun their live show must . playing together their sound whole well belanced even when they spread out into different sections well improvised solos their musical understanding each other shines through band just blends togethe	-1
bottom line : if you like tom middleton dance mixes ( sound cosmos , trip ) or jedi knights ' production , you're going love this ! buy it ! ok , this not much like other global communication releases , but that no reason such animosity . legal reasons , duo tom middleton mark pritchard cannot use name jedi knights any more ( remember george lucas guy ? ) . previously , jedi knights their avenue releasing their space-funk oriented material , their popular global communication moniker reserved techno-ambient musings . so , this managed confuse some people , which unfortunate because this album really deserves high praise . this not ambient album , but it superb example sweet booty-shaking tunes these guys also known . just glance track list alone should awake shivers electronic music fanatics , since it features tunes dabrye , trickski , one , vince watson , shur-i-kan , balil ( better known black dog ) well new tune tom middleton himself ! album also ventures into some excellent hip-hop seems disappointing other reviewers , but i am enjoying it lot . however , i feel album just keeps getting better it goes ( although dabrye rule ) end , we're into some sugariest detroit-styled techno you ever hear . it expertly mixed tunes you won't get any other compilation/mix , you know it love since it got gc name . what more you want people ? oh , way , i love 76:14 too , but doesn't mean you can't enjoy other types music well .	1
let get things clear before we begin , i'm black guy trapped white boy body ... i'm actually trying raise money get racial surgery . just kidding ... but i'm not kidding when i say how much i love power funk music . there just something so amazingly raw this music . so much today music overproduced underdone . it just leaves you feeling like , " what crap i just listened it ? " other words , it fast food ears ... this other hand feast soul . it leaves you feeling satisfied , delighted , funked up ! it collection songs you just can't help but smiling when you hear them . issac hayes , curtis mayfield , parliament just few " shining stars " this cd gives you there many , many more . i may white , but i'm not dead . this just terrific stuff . only reason i'm giving it four stars because song " word up " . i got my white butt kicked while song playing background ... it not cameo fault happened , i just happened wrong place right time every time i hear song , i freak ... not good way though ... anyway , it all good , right ? right	-1

wow , they actually put this " anti-classic " cd . seriously , this very bad album . practically none " superstars " sing , other than jimmy hart , they mostly stuck dumb novelty songs . not they fare too well when they sing " serious " songs . nikolai volkoff decent baritone voice , but his thick accent renders " cara mia " unintelligible . probably worst singing here roddy piper , although captain lou albano gives him run money . if you fan bad celebrity singing , you should get this album	-1
bruce springsteen always remembered nebraska , born run , or born usa . nebraska my favorite out those three , but here my second favorite . tunnel love bruce examination his first marriage there some tearjerkers here . he should given respect this album , like dylan blood tracks , his personal opus . favorites include tougher than rest , cautious man , ain't got you , tunnel love , two faces , brilliant disguise , one step up , when you're alone . highly highly recommended	1

always - intro , using woman/rap metaphor like " kick it beat " best part . good upbeat tempo . add-a-cipher - his statement crowd size , cuts dj flo fader , first two guests . deal wid it - this one those songs which , j-live fan hearing it like , alright , that cool message , but you wouldn't want one your mainstream friends hear it because they would say he just crying over his life which non-gansta begin . get live - worst song ep , which means its worth listening it comes around rotation but you wouldn't skip . it problem chorus which just yelling get live !, but verses hot dope always so you can't skip it because chorus man , ' cause you'll miss good stuff . car trouble - second guest appearance here wordsworth , who doesn't rap but plays rider j taxi/rap industry metaphor . 9000 miles - when i first heard this i didn't really like it , i skipping it some , but it grew me , now it my favorite . when you're listening this first time , don't let refrain turn you off because message perfect when you're sort mood , i put it " world hopeless " folder " nights like this " all above . skip proof - outro . verse too short , just like whole ep . beat nothing right home , kind reminscent " don't get it backwards . " buy it . peace . note - i mentioned best part , which j first album , which you can't get amazon , so i hope they won't mind my suggestion getting it off www.sandboxautomatic.com check j website whoever he signed today because there usually link , he www.j-livemusic.net	1

if you ever read insert this album , band admits they trying red hot chilli peppers , primus , mr. bungle all rolled into one , but considering they still teenagers when recording all songs this album you cut them some slack . fungus amongus showed potential these guys . today they thrown away most talent they once order make it big . even though make yourself solid release , it showed signs band selling out . their two latest releases pretty lackluster . its just too bad theyll never make album this quality again . so heres how id rank all lncubus ' albums best worst1 . . . i . . . . . 2 . fungus amongus3 . make yourself4 . crow left murder5 . morning vie	-1

though people may mention this first concept album , what more important me it poking fun music industry . just " rock " becoming serious music rock journalism beginning , who decided some fun idea space straight songs such pop perfection " i see miles " " commercials " such " heinz baked beans " . yes everyone trying live up sergeant pepper but who obviously fun tongue cheek aspects this album , unlike stones ' " satanic majesties " which except few songs dated arrival . also " sell out " quintesintially english , not maudlin ballads small faces but closer kinks equally valid pre-punk roster . additional tracks essential . they should there beginning . each song totally different . fun psychadelia " armenia , city sky " , mocking societal conventions " tattoo " soundtrack charles dickens movie never " silas stingy " ( anyone who thinks john entwhistle " just bassist " obviously forgets his classic morbid ditties completed albums ) . cynicism nascent rock industry getting spot top pops all unique time without descending dated art rock zappa . play this back back fall " this nations saving grace " you may find some uncanny similarities	1

zach braff better musical inclination than i . i must admit . what amazing this soundtrack how it strike note anyone remotely into any music . it like refreshing garden state volume 2 . it step ahead , more ambitious but wind around music same . mind you , there no " new slang " or " one these things first " i've only heard this cd some six times but i know i like every song it , soon . chocolate sounds better this album than it snow patrol album ( some reason ) " star mile " star song record . it guy who leaves this girl who one who loved him when noone .

" warning sign " surprised me . it somehow makes things look majestic . excellent . cary brothers ' " ride " album " caring creepy " . el savador good , too . however , " reason why " just plain boring . " prophecy " give me short attention span . one three best tracks cd " arms woman " i mean , wow ! last kiss basically cumulation diverse talent meant diverse moods which might come under one bracket . you hear these songs day your first child born , day your girlfriend breaks your heart , night when you're feeling dull life seems happening somewhere else . it like book which unlike many shelf . this meant neurotics , too .

pink floyd now mythical band , released " dark side moon " early 70 today considered land mark one teh greeatest records all time . " wish you here " album came afterwards 1979 also magnificiant double album " wall " . although it hard compare them , i think these 3 albums all 5 stars masterpieces their own without making further analyzations . " wish you here " concept album dedicated pink floyd fouding member syd barrett left band cause mental ilness just after album " saucerful secrets " releasd ( although he appeared sessions ) sadly left us good june 2006 . it jazzy prog/rock influenced album great melodies 5 songs where 2 last over 10 minutes . david gilmour guitar play fantastic all through album when he get chance jam long periods roger water craftmanship compositions always fundamental great floyd album , even richard wright co-wrote some songs , it would take 20 years until he would again . it starts " shine you crazy diamond part 1 " which so long it cut 2 parts , originally it 9 parts but not newer records . first opener second closer , originally there song called " shine " used concerts , but it changed current title made much longer aswell . actually part starts long jazzy gilmour solo which one his best , only end waters joins sings some lyrics ( related syd ) there great saxophone solo dick perry . song title also echoes syd barrett name shine , you diamond . you say there several parts 2 " shine " songs ( 9 correct ) which all diffrent each other . song number two called " welcome machine " classic pink floyd song wonderful special effects , synthesizers guitars . song talks their bad experiences music industry , hence they even changed label " wish you here " . third song " cigar " more straight rock then other songs it " just " 5 minutes long , it feautures piano , synthesizers this time very funky blistering guitar solo david gilmour . it also suppost deal their experiences music industry . " wish you here " also got little less special effects magical sounds , basically it song where lyrics focus , gilmour plays accoutic guitar waters sings always , " wish you here " got one their best hooks great riffs aswell . it deals loss syd barrett waters inner feelings alienation depression stardome . perhaps this band most deepest song them all , says alot . second part " shine " closes album , it uses far more special effects synthesizers , but once again fantastic solo gilmour . perfect closer one most magical albums all time . overall , one greatest pink floyd albums . only 5 songs appear it , but they all excellent their own cause they all significant meaning they express so many diffrent kinds feelings , musically this takes you world it long , often somber recordings influents jazz prog . rock . concept album dedicated syd barrett 1946-2006 . rest peace	1
perales immensely prolific composer , catalogued over 450 songs over his 32-year career singer/songwriter . yet his productivity only surpassed his gift composing incredibly profound poems , all which he later envelopes lovely melodies . anyone who followed his trajectory since 1974 , when he released his first album , knows too well perales ' career spanned three distinct epochs . 1970s , socially-conscious perales challenged materialism social hierarchy his day via gems such " el labrador " " ecos de sociedad . " later , when his pouplarity peaked 1980s , he became somewhat more commercial his love songs , such " el amor " " cuando vuelvas . " today , he evolved into artist who no longer needs sell his music ; rather , he much more interested perfecting his craft composer . he admits his official web site , he hopes his best song one he yet compose . this jazzy-tinged album musical gem , yet radical departure stylistically past efforts . perales opted let music speak itself selecting exceptional musicians only few musical instruments . jazz-flavored arrangements , you'll treated flamenco guitars some surprising basso nova stylings . " como llenar mi tiempo " beautiful tribute his wife , wherein he admits her , her absence , he incomplete . " lo que fue de los dos " tragic recount long-term marriage , which both spouses severed passing time loss passion . " una cancion para la paz , " perales returns one his recurring themes : quest peace reconciliation . this composition , he joined brazilian choir , first this seasoned artist . there so much said this terrific collection , yet i am limited space . if you fan soothing arrangements , poignant poetry , melodious songs , this album you .	1
read previous reviews , i almost not buy this album . even what juliana herself written her webpage not encourage me . it not lo-fi everybody seems think . ok it rawer sound more edge than some her recent stuff but it still very good . ths ound not bad it not seem cheaply made all . ok , she plays lots distortion but she allways . songs very beautiful she really come across one ebst songwriters around .	-1

don't believe anybody who think cocteau twins enya-wannabe or something . this 1984 band true originals . there very small siouxie banshees flavour some their songs , but meanwhile this post-punk era music very hypnotic . somtimes this style called dream-pop . sound cool icy absolute amazing . when i hear liz . i feel like snowflake center snow-blast . when i hear song called lorelei tears goes down my eyes i just don't know why . listening this album good you karma !	1
this album hardy velvety voice ranges over wide variety styles . album begins fun , danceable pop song pure late sixties style , quot ; comment te dire adieuquot ; . afterwards , hardy veers slower songs , making beautiful renditions leonard cohen quot ; suzannequot ; , georges brassens ' classic quot ; il n'y pas d'amour heureuxquot ; ( mas-ter-piece , incredible piano arrangements ) jobim bossa nova quot ; sabiquot ; ( french quot ; le msangequot ;) , well singing couple very sweet own compositions , quot ; quoi sert ? quot ; quot ; la mer , les toiles et le ventquot ; , which demonstrate her talent songwriter . towards end album she includes lively french jazz tune , quot ; etonnez-moi , benotquot ; , which stands oddity , but quite fun . recommended all lovers sixties stuff	-1
i introduced beatles this cd when i maybe 14 . it first time i ever heard beatles . i liked their sound so i illegally downloaded rest their cd . this cd pry one most kids subjected trying pass this great sound into next generation , they could better job especially first five songs . first five songs would good songs nsync perform . i just imagine justin timberlake singin " i want hold your hand . " they should replace first five songs more songs showed pure genious beatles . songs like george harrison masterpieces " here comes sun " , or " while my guitar gently weeps " . psychodelic songs like " lucy sky diamonds " or " strawberry fields forever " would better selections , especially decreases heavy drugs kids use now adays compared 60 . " norwegion wood " , " saw her standing there " , " free bird " , " here , there , everywhere " would much better selections then there early boy band music . they included some great beatle songs like " ballad john yoko " spectacular " hey jude " . i understand this cd could not possibly included all their amazing music , but they should made better selections showed off their complete range . it quite possible this only cd beatles young people ever here . they should given better selection their music .	-1
this album not type person who wants not listen hard want they're hearing . if you don't like complicated , intent listening requiring music , this not you - don't get it . but if you like stuff this perfect you !!! if you're thinking buying it now , read . if not , go review or somthing . this really amazing stuff . lines , though they may not seem glimps , beautiful . this album transition point modern jazz you almost feel miles searching new things play just while listening . i'm not great reviewer but what i'm trying say , " get this album becuase it really amazing , beautiful , interesting , other things " get this !!!!	1
rather surprisingly , this great album . i don't think many ' 24 ' viewers rate callery music vital series , it almost always plays background colors scenes without containing hum-along themes grandeur heroism . but cd callery score reveals itself complex , extremely varied worthy more than casual listen . great liner notes comments each piece it usage series . recommended	-1
gy ! unlike anything else i listen , yet they've never fallen out my rotation very long . this pretty impressive thing , way i listen music tends sorta streaming or cyclical , so things i listen bring mind something else i like so i go listen so forth . this tends mean bands i like bit different or don't fall into typical genres i listen tend fall out rotation without my really intending them . gy ! probably most different or incongrous band i listen , but they somehow manage never forgotten very long . ' yanqui u.x.o ' my favorite album their , it probably one my 10 favorite albums all time . it good . many noted , this album bit different their earlier stuff it lacks samples found sounds , tends build slower , generally calmer overall . this makes it take bit longer get into , or it me anyway , but once you've really listened it thoroughly i think you'll find it their most consistently intriguing album . certainly , gy ! hardly ever got boring before , but their sound wasn't tight , lotsa outros intermediary passages which may somewhat interesting themselves , but didn't necessarily add whole composition all much . everything here seems tie together bit more cleanly . sound , overall , more desolate then before , but still plenty emotional power . ( moreso then any other band i've heard , matter fact . ) still , basic sounds still their : roaring , wind-like guitars , some slowly chiming , repeating guitar lines , simple cyclical string sections , pulsing bass inexplicably yet undeniabkt moving drums . 5 tracks , this album 3 main compositions . opening one , ' 09-15-00 ' weakest them , but it still fantastic . opening movement slow , dreamlike simple melodies chiming one over . real power song , comes 8 minutes prominent strings combining their electronic howling create their patented gy ! waves sound , this time particularly dark hypnotic variety . sadly , closing quarter track least interesting bit album , some more minimalistic stuff doesn't really add up much melody or atmosphere . it decent stuff , but not up their standards . first half ' rockets fall rocket falls ' more classicist gy ! , building crumbling again again . second half more reflective their newer style , incredibly slow building perpetual bass/percussive thudding tremolo guitars/strings . i'll admit it , i find this portion bit dull initially , but i've really gotten into it since . it got some very nice woodwinds it , extended prelude makes it all more moving when it really kicks up volume . ' motherf --- er = reedeemer ' best composition album , best thing i've ever heard them . first track it , 21 minutes long , some most low-key stuff they've , but it got melody textural variety make it all work . first 10 minutes , though low-key their standards , still pulse energy some nice string lines driving , bass cymbal drum patterns next ten or so minutes , some their absolutely most minimalistic stuff , minutes what really shine , however . it mostly just slowly cycling , 3-6 note guitar lines , some windy atmospherics behind it some beautiful , sorrowful bass lines . eventually it allows bit volume string howling guitar combination punctuation desolation periodically , allowing some most powerful , moving moments i've ever heard any band . i've listened this so damn many times , but it always gets me . volume finally kick again final track , some most sad yet triumphant music gy ! ever made . it perfect punctuation mark album whole , provides nice bit hope overall dreariness . writing review this tough , cause i don't like get all pseudo-poetic everyone , but that really all you if you wanna talk gy ! . individual parts their compositions tend simplicity themselves , but no one else dream understanding texture tone emotion way they . it all comes together make some most beautiful ethereal music you're ever gonna hear . get it .	1

when approached new revival kander ebb bob fosse defining classic cabaret hit shelves i knew moment i saw it i couldn't miss out . however , upon hearing it first time i initially somewhat disappointed . natasha richardson one thing cannot sing far i am concerned however she brings boldness into cd more " acting voice " which describes lyrics us oppossed belty musical theatre pelt . it certain richness it but definitely not something rave . don't expect liza minnelli . allan cumming ' portrayal sinisterly perverted emcee my opinion surpasses joel gray attempt both film original broadway production . exact amount camp , seedyness , evil cheek cumming creates truly unforgetable character amazing voice amazing looks he almost steals cd . this good thing considering emcee appears practically every song . however , ( me ) highlight cd michelle pawk amazing vocal talents her two songs- " tomorrow belongs me " " married " . her brassy portrayal evil villainess fraulein kost steals record not missed . mary louise wilson lost her touch somewhat but still belt out her main numbers maintaining same sass style she always ( despite her age ) . astounding , " blow you away " male female ensemble , enseemble numbers such " willkommen " , " money , money " " tomorrow belongs me " ( amongst others ) pleasure listen . other artists include : ron rifkin ( disappointment ) john benjamin hickey ( his amazingly great singing voice wasted but few lines ) denis o ' hare ( good always . i may only 14 but take my advice buy it ! tis truly great listen	-1
i grew up listening my mom play " teddy bear " , " phantom 309 " etc ., i think they some most interesting heart wrenching songs i ever heard . even today " daddys girl " reminds me times i spent my own father , who passed away last year . red sovine put into words so many years ago what many people felt still think today	-1
this cd played nearly every single weekend we're still not sick it ! all songs just awesome , excellent dancing energizing dead party !	1
i not make comparisons nick drake lightly , but alexi murdoch tunes " time without consequence " rightly compared pink moon , river man , or other legendary drake songs . alexi quiet , confident performances , sung hushed voice guitar ( mostly ) minimal instrumentation , beautiful , haunting , soothing without boring or saccharin . but while alexi murdoch terrific cd may reflect drake style he also clearly his own performer , experimenting different sounds approaches his music . his voice not deepest or strongest you'll hear , but doesn't matter when what conveyed emotion beauty . this cd feels like private performance worth revisiting , few weeks since it released i listened it dozens time keep hearing something new interesting each time . loud world , this cd whispers your attention genuinely deserves it	1
... or you just paranoid ? you sure ? you even know whether you awake or dreaming ? such atmosphere created this minimalistic , dark work . it though you trapped deep underground some pitch black cave , yet place you far too surreal situation quite simple . while not quite desolate or dark lustmord other work , this definitely not anyone looking upbeat material . fact , this album probably more introduce dark ambient genre more people than any work recent memory , deservedly so ; it engaging piece ( all tracks flow together if they one ) it certainly one best its kind . these two guys should definitely collaborate again . if you like this cd , you should also check out ' cold summer ' lull , , course , lustmord own ' heresy .	-1
other than obvious hits ; highlights include power equality , if you ask , i could lied , righteous wicked , naked rain sir psycho sexy . frusciante begins evolve band begins break new ground ( they continued over years [ it makes you wonder what if hillel slovak hadn't died ]) . cool party vibe throughout disc , not all dark melancholy like some later albums . bssm all around great album even 15 years later ; other rhcp albums remastered , so why not this one ? we miss you " huckleberry " , thank god john :)	1
me , thing seperates very good albums great albums consistency -- i listen entire album without wanting skip any tracks ? i've found only few albums like , but this one them . despite title , there actually 11 tracks here , each one quite different last . but album works , very consistent . i can't name favorite track because they're all very good , though my least favorite would " it probably me " -- though i don't dislike it enough skip over it . if you're new sting , this album i would recommend picking up first . not only it my favorite sting album , but one my favorite albums , period	1

here some thoughts i regarding ray davies ' thanksgiving day ep : 1 . title track reminds me lot otis redding . i imagine him covering it . i especially enjoyed horns . i look muscian credits see if they memphis horns ( surprised see they weren't ) . 2 . i also enjoyed other three tracks , although i preferred original version london song , since i felt , words reviewer bluegrass state , it " rocked " more . 3 . not it anything ep , but i think it interesting when ray started out this country , his labelmates included dean martin trini lopez now they include white stripes . 4 . speaking reviewer bluegrass state , my feeling ray , well any member any group , every right perform release solo , especially since dave released solo projects past . i'm looking forward ray album next february , which this ep good taster . ( note : mention reviewer bluegrass state referred negative review deleted who bascially said ray selfish pursuing solo career instead getting kinks back together brother dave " rocked "	-1
this album isn't babe party all guys flock around . this album cute girl plain dress no make-up you ask out when you finally realize you've great time talking her last two hours . solid but unflashy musicianship supports songs personal their specifics , but universal their feel . mostly just electric acoustic guitars , bass , drums , they stay out way , letting edwards ' breathy voice carry melodies you find yourself humming days later . if you like fist-pumping anthems , you bored this album . if your idea first date going clubbing until 3 a.m. , don't come here . but if your idea first date sitting coffee shop talking hours , then here your coffee shop .	-1
remarkable irs compilation just released , question presented ... could this cd good one ? i am not going compare this cd one , irs cd heads above this one , but because music era simply better or because songs this cd don't cover period expertly more recent best ? i feel fine covers six year period ... this one adds decade figure . yes , rem , but out albums more frequently irs than band its current run warner brothers . but you five albums plus irs best , warners 7 cds worth material , which one main problems , music r.e.m. changed great deal throughout period critics who maintain music not all play cohesively together correct . much better compliation would time best r.e.m. 1988-1996 , or all r.e.m. albums feature original line up . seperating non berry songs into future possible best part iii disc would created more central focus band their most univerally popular era music much stronger album overall album presented here should looked something like this : 1 . " man moon " i no problem this song first cd it prime example stipes writing bands playing this time , plus it aftp which central album middle era rem put out . 2 . " great beyond " released out era presented , song feature r.e.m. top later stage game . this song work well following prequel song before it one few times eras mix well . if i break rules , i would leave this song . but i also think it would work well " third " best cd , one where r.e.m taking look back their catalog . era where they movies inspired songs they made . taking this song out i would replace it " country feedback " song which flow nicely following " man moon " like " radio free europe " signature song after opening mood setting track . 3 . bad day , this little bit cheating their part . it clearly irs years , which perhaps why i like it so much . it deserves some kind best . or , they could saved it put it opening track around sun , perhaps setting better tone entire album . i feel fine doesn't need any new material its best portion it benifits greatly it . take bad day out , base album around it it wouldn't feel out place . perhaps here would good place more up tempo green number such " pop song 89 " . 4 . " what frequency , kenneth " . fits right here . 5 . " all way reno " , not bad song , but clearly out place , its rather lounge vibe . move it third best put no exuse leaving it off " drive " here . 6 . " losing my religon " all better after " drive " nice one two punch . 7 . " e-bow letter " leave it here . great song . 8 . " orange crush " ditto . 9 . " imitation life " this song works , one few blends , i think its great song but integrity , put " bittersweet me " here instead , one many naihf songs skipped . 10 . " daysleeper " again good but more later day , why not " world leader pretend " overall mood ? 11 . " animal " i am tempted say this worst song here glaringly proves point two eras don't mix . take it out go back out time " near wild heaven " yeah , let mills mix things up little here , this discs " rockville " 12 . " sidewinder sleeps tonite " some critical this song ( even band ) , little too close " shiny " but it must moment this disc . it would weird without it . 13 . " stand " can't leave this out even if many fans hate it . call this required part disc . 14 . " electrolite " always little iffy me but popular highlight new adventures so it stay , many love it . 15 . " all right friends " belongs second disc i feel fine . here , it feels forced carrot thrown out place warner brothers . 16 . " everybody hurts " worthy must . 17 . " my most beautiful " love song , clearly off up though representative beach boys faze they would fully explore reveal . more fitting song would " you everything " overlooked song green . 15 . " strange currencies " sets up closer very nicely . 18 . nightswiming , great ending album . so album should without much altering would consist : 1 . man moon 2 . country feedback 3 . pop song 89 4 . what frequency , kenneth 5 . drive 6 . losing my religon 7 . e-bow letter 8 . orange crush 9 . bittersweet me 0 . world leader pretend 1 . near wild heaven 2 . sidewinder sleeps tonite 3 . stand 4 . electrolite 5 . everybody hurts 6 . you everything 7 . strange currencies 8 . nightswimming so there you my opinion much better mix , like i feel fine , good mixture all cds ( you add more bang blame , leave maybe me honey if we match 21 songs ) still no shiny happy people . you left very worthy , if still slightly inferior sequel irs disc .	-1
alternative world beat ? psychedelic electro-rock ? i not imagine what hell this album . nor , when thinking it , sound layers seem like they would make compatable song -bulgarian(i think ... ) goth-enya lyrics rock-solid wall electric guitar . but , murky pool these influences rises misty vapor mesmerizing just any cd i've heard ages . this music very edgy , almost disturbing . unlike good chunk ebm ( stretch call it so ... ) , i think it really important turn down volume bit really take what this album . truthfully , i can't wait listen it again become once more lost mysteriously dark mix ... erm ... whatever this . rhea obsession stands alone	1
i heard mahler symphony #2 many time performance recordings . my opinion , none equals this fantastic effort mehta . it revelation beginning end . my first experience piece hearing bruno walter conduct new york philharmonic captivating performance long ago . introduction this apotheosis romantic music pales comparison . there very good reason why this recording never out print . it simply best .	1
this cd most phsychadelic cd i ever heard . what amaizing fact it achieves this feat without sounding egotistical . pitchfork write ok computer more revolutionary . pitchfork write all day , but it never make it true . every song this cd makes me feel emotion without even understanding lyrics , extent it almost makes me feel physically high . listening ok computer makes me feel too , but not extent loveless . ok computer not near inventive or wierd loveless ultimately not good loveless	1
there so many fabulous reviews this cd i agree them . i've billie holiday fan years own many discs her music , but i find myself reaching this one lot . it great collection songs her voice so sweet true here . she top form arrangements songs all excellent . whoever put this cd together knew what they doing . this definitely billie during earlier part her career there real lightness this music . ( her later music great too , but very different . ) most songs this cd classics even if you're unfamiliar her , you'll probably still recognize many them . there some crackling background noise some songs , since they recorded back late thirties/early forties , though it not bad most time you barely notice it . some stand outs " you go my head " , " very thought you " , " let it " , " way you look tonight " , just name few . i think this would great introductory cd someone who curious her would like hear some her music	1

power metal kings strike again black halo which one amazing piece metal mastery . opener march miphesto i enthralled this album its soaring melodies , driving beats intricate guitar solos ... i mesmerized . roy amazing vocal range really shown off here tracks like : haunting , soul society abandoned . all songs incredibly melodic catchy yet still make you want bang your head . one other thing mention here symphonic parts which give this album its epic feel really helps round out band sound . black halo one incredible musical journey one which everyone should take .	1
i am big fan cassandra wilson duped into buying this disc after reading reviews here elsewhere . i knew after first 3 songs trouble brewing they all sounded alike . indeed , entire thing suffers same muddy mix monotone vocals . what waste . no diversity song selection no vocal range . she should lose t-bone burnett her next effort . * note * she displayed this same poor judgment concert her song list	-1
quot;let get it , quot ; particularly this reissue , deserves no fewer than five stars . while alternate versions demos aren't essential original album itself , they still provide wonderful insight into how marvin gaye created this masterpiece . if you're casual fan , go regular edition ; if you enjoy gaye anything more than surface level , though , this cd worth your money	1
it interesting discover most low ratings this album got andrea bocelli fans who seemed threatened cd potential . it not really fair compare two artists honestly , they different leagues altogether although they share duet once ( remarkable one ... ) i first heard sarah brightman harem tour one experience unlikely forgotten . i thought harem pinnacle , but then i discovered la luna , pinnacle eclipsed moon . not one single song out place , all together , they lend this mystic feeling one round listening isn't enough , you just press replay button again again . i won't claim i know all background story surrounding each song . apparently , most cover some you taken particular dislike just single fact . except dido " here me " , i've never heard songs before i think sarah voice more than capable giving them justice . it really hard find standout song , because all them exceptionally . but if i'm gonna pushed wall forced just pick couple , la califfa very haunting heartwrenching . course title track , la luna . i wish i hear more-operatic version it just soothe my curiosity . eagerly awaiting her next thematic offering ..	1
most songs great ; i didn't know i knew them , but when i heard them , they amazing . couple left something desired , however . overall , though , it great cd	-1
if you don't sade " diamond life " or even if you , this " best " cd welcome addition any music collection . this unique singer continues haunt me like girl ipanema .	-1
it nine years since so so def ceo ( now virgin records ' president black music ) jermaine dupri released label gold-certified compilation so so def bass all stars , vol . 1 . since then he steered careers rappers da brat bow wow well releasing three other compilations showcasing diversity talent among south . past , all dupri compilations launching pads regional artists well critically-acclaimed albums . not so his latest effort , young , fly flashy vol . 1 ( so so def/virgin ) . poor attempt showcasing newest so so def signees , album falls short providing taste how innovative dope southern hip-hop . instead we given project full lackluster tracks , recycled concepts artists whose passion just not enough set them part popular players today burgeoning southern rap scene . newcomers young capone kid slim fail impress tracks like " i'm hot " tedious " 10 toes " . talented artists like boyz da hood slim thug repping heavily south , competition too fierce dupri newest draft picks deliver no originality . party joints like " gotta getcha " , which too short enjoyed , kp envyi " put cha hands up " both mediocre attempts club-friendly radio songs . " put cha hands up " just not get party started same way duo 1997 hit " shorty swing my way " . what could hot ode exotic dancers if it just little longer ( " gotta getcha " ) , clocks less than three minutes . but southern enthusiasts don't fret ; all not lost this lp there few tracks worth checking . " kodak moment " authentic down-south rider music featuring kavious , pastor troy ugk bun . addictive " i think they like me " ( remix ) made stuntin ' your ride worth listen just hear da brat scene-stealing bars . atl veteran pastor troy shines again " just fight " , which reminiscent his classics " no more play ga " " i declare war .

i thought i'd write review this cd . this great recording ocean night pounding crashing waves distant foghorns . i experimented this cd burn't it my hardrive using musicmatch than i downloaded it my rca lyra mp3 player just see how it sounds mp3 . it sounds great you hear every detail waves foghorn course you always take it off mp3 player . but it could relaxing walk nature sounds . i still listen cd though . i use lyra mostley music but nature sounds sound great too . since this recording 60 minutes long it take little longer download your mp3 player . it took it 2 minutes mine it only takes second music . but if you this cd , musicmatch or windowsmedia player mp3 player you may want try listening this while your walking	1
wow . i remember going cd store 1997 seeing two riverdales cds . quot ; hmmmquot ; i thought myself .... quot;they're lookout ! records they look pretty coolquot ; . well , 3 years i didn't think them until i found out they sounded ungodly amount like ramones , one my favorite bands . so , i checked them out , sure enough , they rocked . storm streets great , solid album i don't even own , but am obsessed it already . i there first one which rocks well , but storm streets seems so much more structered well-produced(judging songs i've heard ) . ever heard huntingtons ? huntingtons huge rip-off riverdales .... they sound exactly like them . i really like huntingtons , but riverdales get more respect because they came first . so fans screeching weasel , huntingtons , queers , course ramones , enjoy this albu	1
this one my most favorite commissioned albums ever . reason because fred marvin great singers this last project they together before their solo careers really took flight . i love this album , " dare believe " classic . " i'm learning " one my all-time favorites . " love way " " come home " two blazing , bumping tracks get you bobbing your head . then album goes urban praise worship last few tracks which uplifting spiritual . " draw me nearer " , vocally , commissioned its best . one add collection	1
this album huge transition cold . since their last album , " year spider " band deal loss both guitarists , let go their record label , public lashing tour mates evanescence scooter ward ongoing personal issues . lyrically this album compares well any cold previous work . it obvious scooter ward driving force behind cold lyrical poetry . if you're fan previous work , especially tracks " year spider " . cold sound really evolved their first album their second addition terry balsamo guitarist songwriter . music took great turn second album improved musicianship somewhat familiar nu-metal sound . although two new guitarists very talented , music this release definitely lacks some bite previous two albums . there no stand-out aggressive track album full softer melodic tunes . sure , there great songs this album ; " different kind pain " , " happens all time " , " feel it your heart " , " when heaven not far away " , " god song " , " when angels fly away " . album solid throughout , no filler all . songs those strong hard hitting introspective lyrics typical cold music , musicianship remains solid , sam mccandless again stand out drums . it just album feels like there no progress their last album , almost though these songs written same time , just didn't make last album . i think it obvious terry balsamo departure hurt band music writing department , they just weren't comfortable letting mike booth matt loughran cut loose writing . it shame , album solid , very good , but it fall short compared " 13 ways bleed onstage " " year spider " .	-1
yo , wassup ? this best soundtrack available buy right now , it got great mix dance ramp ; etc you should also buy video , thats even better than soundtrack	1
oo god , one more time ! this collection cream cream great american songbook rock'n'roll singer who contributes nothing all american culture . this rate #1 express my deep deception successful album series . over exposed material which treated so many different ways so many different vocalists artistry should treated respectfully . i am not dictator but i would vote law would impose respect some art expressions which represents treasure american culture . more than , series success reflects lack understanding music context people who should search entertainment more valid truer way . that deal : there truth missing , there sensation money-make production . mellow arrangements , neglectable performances , lacking creativeness . completely forgotten some years ahead .	-1
i find it strangely curious everyone doesn't think this best rb album ever . well maybe if en vogue weren't their record company , everyone might . but how everyone know when heralding single dropped two weeks before album . two weeks not enough time promote album , elektra -- shame you . never i heard mainstream music so well-crafted . time it took them complete this album more than justified . riding coat tails classical pieces brilliant concept : dance sugarplum fairies ; moonlight sonata ; habanera ; etc . it so unfortuante very few either still interested or even knew en vogue then new album . this effort , my mind , blew every other album out water . operatic height they soared this collection amazing : love won't take me out ; vocal complexity sad but true ; cute odd no , no , no . it would truly " masterpiece " it not ill-placed love suite , afterwhich makes me want turn album off ( it feels too much like end ) . while number one man alright song , it latin soul mar overall classical , vocal styling well-written feel this album . girlgroup aspect only viable comparison original en vogue destiny child . destiny child interesteing hear look , but comparisons always confounded me : destiny child not harmony group ; there no lead singer en vogue ; every member en vogue hit song singing lead vocal ; every member en vogue her chance sing her ass off . im not feeling new line-up or music en vogue , but hopefully they'll soon get original members back together studio , promised . i've ignored soul flower because i'm awaiting real en vogue return what sorely missed rb : rich , harmonized , classy music sings love , not sex . cindy ( no more kids , lol , we need you)max ( girl get it together)terry ( miss faithful can't it alone)dawn ( girl you'd better stop playin ' )	1
some want argue statement made title this review but i proudly stand behind my claim . others might confused , but rest assured , " nasty " good thing jazz-rock realm . i tell my trombone player he nasty after just every gig , he . nasty emotional reaction , like funky , comes only music ( i never heard nasty painting or nasty piece architecture , nothing concrete life gives you this reaction ) makes you all kinds nasty things , like curling your lip or dancing badly , or whooping or going " whoaaa " or howling or stomping ... you get idea , it like funky but even more pronounced energetic ... but anyway this album nasty ! miles assembled fantastic band this project , film score documentary boxer jack johnson . band comprised miles , john mclaughlin guitar , michael " nasty " henderson bass ( okay i made nickname up , but he ) , billy cobham drums , herbie hancock organ ( he reportedly stopped studio middle session bag groceries his new album show miles , miles insisted , recording happening , he sit down organ take solo . he it nasty . my only complaint steve grossman , saxophonist , not quite same league rest musicians but his contribution okay nonetheless . first track , " right off , " 25 minutes nastiness , heavy rock roll shuffle featuring mclaughlin most in-your-face guitar solo . few minutes , miles comes , key changes , miles takes what i would consider one his greatest solos ever ; he absolute command his instrument uses whole range blowing highly charged , funky-yet-out solo over persistent yet flexible shuffle groove . there one moment where miles trades exclamatory short blasts rest band everyone so locked it incredible . first eight minutes or so this track worth cost cd these two solos . that not say rest album isn't good , but it not quite good amazing beginning . rest " right off " features hancock organ well grossman saxophone remains healthily nasty throughout , exception reflective section spliced producer teo macero , whose contribution editing this album slightly more prominent than usual . this even more evident second track , " yesternow , " which almost cut-and-paste feeling probably more effective documentary than continuous listening experience without it . there one section " silent way , " just minute long , which miles solos himself over lush , memorable groove earlier album . i found effect this section remind me how much i love album , not one hand . but it still interesting contrast nasty first tune . this tough album place terms accessibility ; it really in-your-face loud , almost distorted guitar but there nothing particularly weird here would turn off casual listener . my friend , trumpeter miles expert , maintains this not jazz album but rather rock album , i would tend agree , though improvisation plays huge role making this music happen ( nothing written beforehand very little rehearsed ) . this actually great bridge into jazz heavier rock , better than any other electric miles which often acquired taste abstract side . jazz fans appreciate miles ' assertiveness interplay happening here ( this not lifeless or stagnant fusion could ) long they not closed-minded incorporation rock into jazz or jazz into rock . all all , first track phenomenal second musing , so this album comes together masterpiece one my favorites miles	1
like many performers who tragically passed away before their time , last twenty five years seen vocalist billy mackenzie elevated minor deity scores unquestioning associates devotees . but this first associates album recorded when equal talents fellow-associate alan rankine allowed showcase themselves . what talent indeed ! it rankine sublime guitar hooks bass lines caused me replay my old audio cassette until paper-thin these last twenty five years . affectionate punch remixed 1982 remix became official release . results disappointing . remix managed tone down rankine guitars almost inaudible level billy helium-high voice takes center stage . it over-worked effort they should left original alone . many years masters original version ' lost ' ( or destroyed mackenzie rumored ) , but second master tape found pressing plant europe few years back results breath-taking reminder why this album cherished me these many years . affectionate punch magazine real life changed face music then since stood test time . buy them both !	1

led zeppelin simply most overrated band all time who just bad nirvana acdc . they only made decent song " stairway heaven " . rest songs just stink !!! plant sounds more like big monkey than real singer can't sing all , he just screams . like good singers ??????? i recommend go foreigner , dire straits who equally greatest bands greatest singers lou gramm , mark knopfler . they billion times better than led zeppelin . don't listen five star reviewers this page , avoid this piece junk go foreigner insted . they legends , not zeppelin !!	-1
they're all here this cd . every one great hits defined one most talented rock groups history . it really strange hear what passes great music today , when you listen this . creedence certain soul-something real you hear it loud clear . talent ? yes , but more than . it just sort reaches inside you , takes hold doesn't let go . this one great cd	1
i agree people who said this isn't best stooges album . it isn't . out big three ( this , raw power , funhouse ) , it definitley worst . but it still good music . thing i love stooges they so original time ( superior mc5 , who we're they're " big brother " band apparently ... whatever ) . they're music sloppy , distorted , whiny , but there something inventive , spontaneous , melodic it too . whether or not stooges ( other bands like them ) fueled fire punk rock movement arguable , but they definitely drove rock into direction it hadn't yet explored . i think alone should merit respect all rock fans . album itself , highlights definitely i wanna your dog , real cool time , 1969 , little doll . but other songs aren't terrible either . even 10-minute track we fall , which i am not fan , still interesting experimentally creative effort something different ( almost sounds like pink floyd ) again they deserve respect . stooges made great music . period . it like nothing else anyone heard , much rock pioneering credibility led zep , black sabbath , doors . if you like funhouse raw power , get this . but if you don't any stooges , get other albums first	-1

just mention this review rca ' living stereo ' release , not later sacd compatible version . rca famous it ground-breaking work mid-to-late fifties when it came vivid , immersive stereo sound it reputation lives this day . i'm not sure if reviewer below experienced vintage classical recordings predating digital era . yes , they contain some tape hiss but it really insignificant what value performances themselves soundstage very vibrant . i personally listened recordings solti decca , jansons emi fischer philips these fine works bartok none come close passionate intensity interpretations or wonderful recorded sound these reiner versions capture . reiner account concerto orchestra , one most famous 20th-century orchestral works , everyone list truly exceptional . music strings , percussion celesta receives just kind wicked , eerie , powerhouse performance make you fan bartok life this piece particular . if you're going own one bela bartok cd , this one best choices market today . after you've ingrained this music into your mind , time miraculous mandarin , piano concertos string quartets follow .	1
this cd truely torture . you start track one course . after several months playing it over over again while rest your cd collection goes unused ( i'm not kidding this ) leaves you suspicious you may going around bend . finally , reason begins return you force yourself listen track 5 , reason you bought cd firt place . you break out again , soon discover track 10 , then track 12 . you feel pathetic because you don't know names songs , just your cd player shows only those numbers . i sometimes compare maysa anita baker , i feel there striking similarities but also very distinct flavors . some tracks little hokey , they no meaning me personally , but you tell they come very personal experiences she lived . oh well , i give her this opportunity , fair trade what she gives me rest this cd . thanks maysa , you babe	1
i wrote superb review two days ago , it posted yesterday now its gone , so i'll write review ( without insulting more people ).: van halen , one greatest debuts all time . sure , rock healthy this time : ac/dc just stepped into rock circuit making name themselves , led zeppelin recent album " presence " made it #1 ( i think first band ) , kissmania taking over america , boston debut became fastest selling debut history . also notbale tour acts like ted nugent , blue oyster cult , nazareth , legendary black sabbath , who weren't real succesful record wise but amazing status touring giants . but then punk occured real rock jeopardy . solution ? these four guys : david lee roth(had put him first satisfy his big ego ) , eddie van halen(who every public poll taken beaten likes angus young , eric clapton , yes even your beloved jimmy page ) , alex van halen(who pretty sick drummer ) , micheal anthony(who should nicknamed ' god backup vocals ' ) because these guys rock ' roll given second chance live , chance retard groups like clash shut hell up . i hate writing debut reviews , because you say what band introduced , which takes friggn forever , so i'm going write normal album review : 1 . runnin devil ( 3:32 ): introduction extremely loud music ! my brother woke me up this once full blast i ear damage ! quality this amazing , sounds like this song recorded just yesterday . while eddie solo not his best it still trademark wail it eddie so acclaimed . 2 . eruption ( 1:42 ): most amazing studio recorded guitar solo ever ! all three instruments featured here but most obvious eddie alex . alex drumbeats set path eddie amazing fingertap solo , much like metal blitzkreig kills everything its path (?) ! 3 . you really got me ( 2:37 ): they took good song made it better . listen old one then listen this , there definite improvement it , it like boys recreated song scratch . 4 . ain't talkin ' ' bout love ( 3:37 ): most popular song off this album , very kiss-like atmosphere it heavier riffs dave trademark falsetto scream . 5 . i'm one ( 3:44 ): big band back again metal form !! you see many people complain van halen destroying music , contrary : they brought music back ! this song perfect example how van halen resurrected old 50 music create unique sound . 6 . jamie cryin ' ( 3:30 ): probably first hair metal song ever created ( pretty good if it ) . 7 . atomic punk ( 3:00 ): this song created put salt wound punk music . you see van halen created this extremely heavy virtuosic song reveal kindergarten music talent punk bands world saying " we punk , times 1000000 " ) . i got eddie solo , which not only 100x sound punk solo , but also 100x speed . 8 . feel your love tonight ( 3:40 ): pop-influenced song , can't think anything else , it good listen . 9 . little dreamer ( 3:22 ): sounds like aerosmith influenced sound throughout dark atmosphere . ironic , considering it song succeeding where others say you fail . 10 . ice cream man ( 3:18 ): john brim cover , though many mistake it vh original song . i think acoustic intro both david lee roth eddie , kind interesting hear lighter side band after all their electric songs . then halfway through band turns their instruments create great climax soulful song . 11 . fire ( 3:01 ): intense closer , not very common van halen album . guitar work here one most copied sounds metal history . van halen ranking : 1 . fair warning2 . women children first3 . van halen 4.19845 . van halen ii6 . balance 7.51508 . ou8129 . diver down10 . unlawful carnal knowledge11 . live : right here , right now12 . van halen	1

ronnie martin back much anticipated new joy electric release , " ministry archers " , fourth volume band ongoing " legacy " series its first new subcategory entitled " moog dynasty " . " archers " , we find martin experimenting variety new sounds musical elements . most notable difference this previous joy-e releases rhythms themselves . instead simplistic beats hallmark martin classic sound , rhythms here more driving , heavier border edge industrialism . musical arrangements also tighter eloquently orchestrated . besides this , there two genuine experimental moments heard album instrumentals " hornets horns " " intricacies " which display sound reminiscent early tangerine dream . lyrics , they clever direct anything else released joy-e . end , while there many new exciting sounds heard " ministry archers " , album still sounds like genuine joy electric release ronnie martin greatest achievement yet . minor quibble fact " archers " only clocks 32-minutes total . however , there many albums run twice length maybe only two or three great tracks them rest mediocre . " ministry archers " thankfully no such album all ten tracks excellent . this makes short running time seem lot longer undoubtedly enjoyable listening experience beginning end . instant classic !!! standout tracks include : become murders , most terrible archer , you refrain , title track two aforementioned instrumentals .	1

magnetic field stephin merritt reminds me some other extremely gifted pop producers , or composer/producer/musicians , who gift us their own musical visions , skills enter recording studio deliver this vision which then shared listener . other such music geniuses , individuals such legendary phil spector , brian wilson todd rundgren , eclectic brian eno , indie cult performer east village pipe all come mind . all these men share common ability create music so breathtakingly beautiful it induce tears joy listener . it also seems case nearly all these individuals share common history struggling some inner demon , or personal pathology . case wilson east river pipe , drugs psychosis ; case artist responsible this fine record , sense loneliness lingering depression . it clear while stephin merritt appreciates love ideal state , elusive state mind , he also finds it very hard manage . fact merritt gay both incidental , well essential ( sense it pointing him toward certain types musical lyrical sensibilities past ); hence , there various dualisms stephin merrit t.t his - wasp nest one merritt other bands , 6ths - my favorites his records . i acknowledge greatness his later concept albums , johnny cash meets depeche mode brilliance charm highway strip , i greatly enjoy some magnetic fields ' earlier works . but here , merritt deep baritone , his gentle , subtle arrangements , sheer beauty his songs , gives me nothing but satisfaction . i wonder , there ever love anthem fantastic love lighter than air ? why it not hit , i'll never know .	1

this album like everyone said masterpiece . jeff mangum nasal whine not your typical singer voice , but it grows you incredibly fast . guitar chords simple but always convey proper emotion lyrics , i must stress , anything but nonsensical . they incredibly deep full fresh take love struggles life death . album inspired reading anne frank story , it easy detect pieces story filtering through , especially songs holland 1945 oh comely , which masterpiece itself . emotion this album unparalelled . it sparse yet powerful . also , lyrics not nonsensical . they complex figurative , but after struggling them enough listens , they begin make sense . mangum voice so perfectly suited this music because , frankly , lyrics would sound very emo if your typical pop singer singing them . give it chance . it may require multiple listens , but rewards well worth it .	1
well , guys jessica simpson thr worst worst . she sings badly she looks . this cd very , very , very bad . avoid wait new iron maiden cd which should out shortly .	-1
i agree all other reviews except i think they not address sound quality . listen , this superb collection classic band peak their powers . if you coltrane fan , then you dont need my approval , yes , yes , get this album . performances amazing . if you budding coltrane fan , definitely try other calssic live albums first , such " live village vanguard " or " live birdland " . sound quality packaging much better . said , eventually you become convert buy this album down road anyway ...	-1
when i first listened this album it wasn't good i expected it but i really it . it gives you taste what it like concert ( if you've never one ) true vocal abilities artist . michael his brother amazing voices but michael most unique . i really like this album . if you don't this album get it soon possible	-1
word classic gets thrown around lot reviews , especially rappers mcs who no means come close comparison ! don't sweat technique classic !!! masta killas no said date not . if you want real hip hop music , what better lp there give you blueprint it . lyrics beats this incredible	1
i bought this cd totally disapointed it no where it say not origional artists this very bad cd redone music even worse artists save your mone	-1
i admit , first listening , i found some aspects ms. belle interpretations these pieces disorienting . however , i listened these covers repeatedly , i now say i understand better what vocalist after . not i always agree her george duke , arranger/producer , but i agree their choices their totally new project enjoy my horizons broadened . ms. belle immense talent , superb technique , clear idea each piece , she delivers goods without faltering or compromise . i admire lot performer . her choices ask us reaction we free accept or reject what she offered us . when i first heard these renditions , i quite stand-offish , but over time i come appreciate them more more - almost point addiction - am grateful regina george their strength conviction well their superior musicianship . they not want us listen passive way , they waiting our reaction .. god , this really so , so good .... that true spirit which album should recorded . i'd encourage you get this album because it strong , powerful personal interpretations some great jazz standards regina . you may love everything it , or you may reject aspects her interpretations . but any case you not remain indifferent ; you enriched hearing these pieces clear beautifully personal way . important aspect why i love this imaginative , innovative quality music why this recording invaluable . it cannot said enough her backing band incredible , giving this album necessary push take it over edge . it success because it skilfully avoids categorized . regina courage break out traditional mould make successful cross-over , which some purists may not approve ... only time tell ....	1
early 90 , single " grey cell green " got lot airplay mtv . it catchy song band i never heard so i picked up cassette ( it 90 ) . rest album even better . " throwing things " stands one best songs never become single . " kill your television " standout . all songs extremely catchy , energetic pop tunes . unfortunately , bands follow up albums not much fun . but , few artists could put out album good this one . i since upgraded cd still listen it quite bit .	1
granted , they only need it one composition ( last one , " james bond theme " ) but still , without guitar it just not same . barry didn't compose this one so i suppose it bonus i shouldn't complain , really . rest music all cds fantastic . some stuff i heard before without realizing who composed it . very enjoyable , say least	1
this one makes sense , because fact kidz bop existence very , very scary . you know someone gonna say sooner or later	-1
i all 3 cds - wreck , rerelease , import . music amazing so refreshing . i keep 1 car , 1 home , 1 computer . see my site anna nalick dot com ! she so very talented- much more than any " star " or " singer ' out there today . she writes her own music lyrics ! rock , anna , we love ya	1
when i listened sample songs amazon.com " make yourself " album , i knew i get this cd when i heard song " drive . " needless say , it good choice get album . i listened morning view crow left murder before this one , so my expectations little different , but overall , make yourself good album listen o.o ne things i like incubus their diversity their songs ; sure , majority songs make yourself rock songs , but some songs here display how band tried experiment different genres . songs like " i miss you , " " battlestar scralatchtica , " " stellar , " " drive , " just name few . privilege one my favorite tracks album . i dunno why , but i like how vocals sound when track hits " find yourself back door " part . very good song . 9/10nowhere fast also good song . like privilege , this one rock track . although it few slow moments it , it then picks up fast beat again . 8/10consequence nice lyrics . this track shows what it like punished something you've , not bad song all . 8.5 /10the warmth tells you not turned off jerks society , instead encourages you hang nicer people . good lyrics , my opinion , good beat . 8.5 /10when it comes hard rock song , except little steadier than other rock songs this cd . not much else say it . 8/10stellar amazing-sounding song . listen echo morning view album you'll hear what i mean . there nothing else say stellar except it great-sounding song good vocals lyrics . 9/10the actual make yourself song ... bit tricky review . half it lyrics tell you yourself " making yourself . " it good beat well . only thing bothers me this song constant use " " -word throughout song ... this word doesn't even make sense this song . but overall it isn't bad track . 8/10drive undoubtedly best song cd ! it amazing vocals , lyrics , beat , etc . everything it amazing . you know those instances which you favorite song cd ? this one those instances . i listened drive sample right here amazon , my reason getting album . everything song perfect . you should buy cd just this purpose . lyrics explain why it important not let your fears " drive you " , you should " take wheel . " amazing song ! 10/10clean song interesting , yet good , lyrics . lyrics explain how someone tries use insults , yet insults always come out unharmful . other than , this song rock track . 8/10battlestar scralatchtica instrumental songs portraying full talent turntablist , quite amazing . this instance which incubus experiments their sound . 8/10 " i miss you " , my opinion , song some best lyrics cd . it also steady-paced flows smoothly . vocals also nice . 9/10 " pardon me " shows some fast-paced vocals , they sound difficult pull off . its lyrics also hold some meaning . 8.5 /10out under song heaviest beats it whole make yourself album . it also my least favorite track , because my opinion lyrics don't make much sense ( " resist p*ss wind , anyone who end up smelling " ) . 7/10my overall score this album 4/5 because strength tracks such drive , stellar , privilege , consequence . i would given it star if it used bad language less , if down under different lyrics , if make yourself few different lyrics later parts song . but meh ... those only few slight flaws . pay attention all positive stuff this album buy it , because it worth your money .	-1
what great song this . remixes also very good . my personal favorite cd single " 1 . sdp extended vocal . other remixes all very good also . great buy any madonna fan	1
i hestitated write review " purple rain " years because 1 . i listened this album 4 years everyday ( 1984- 1988 ) never knew what it truly . 2 . many ways it made most profund change me person . 3 . because underneath it sexuality greatest christian rock album all times4 . also greatest musical statment rock era . many ways prince revolution " purple rain " extension classic sly family lineup ( whom he takes probaly his greatest inspiration musically ) their second album together he leaves minneapolis sound somewhat instead punk/funk nu wave vibes 1999 he opts power pop like who kinks songs like " let go crazy " classic clash synth pop townsend -like guitar chrouses but lyrics start him either prayer thearpists chair traditonal gospel intro talking ' afterworld ' or insanity ( much like marvin gaye lyrically his best ) those minneapolis synths coleman dr. fink swirling vamping , song becomes power pop heaven guitar freaks lyrics which captures lust , salvation insanity it perfect guitar solos end it cathraic release siginals we not only listening soundtrack but it core christian rock album but it doesn't sound like newsboys , amy grant or dc talk album because unlike those groups , prince talks flesh ways these artists would never broach album . side one ( i it vinyl , cd tape ) after insanity let go crazy great pop take me u it great arrangement while appolonia vocally limited , she turns great performance this song prince great singer could overwhelmed her vocally but he stays her range " beautiful ones " only rb sounding song side one , beautiful declaration love his girlfriend time susanah melvion . his best smokey robinson/curtis mayfield/eddie kendricks falsetto he pleads great tenderness verse " if i told u baby if i love u baby baby baby we could married would coolin last verses he demands she makes chociedo u want him ? or u want me cause i want utell me baby u want me !!!! i gotta know i gotta knowcomputer blue probaly most song hendrix/funkadelic spirit lyrically musical exceution it wendy lisa sapphic intro bathing each other into most insane prince guitar jam it his sexual id run amuck musically lyric " til i find righteous one computer blue " revolution jamming prince plays some best solos i ever him play it eddie hazel - like first solo before breakdown into ernie isley-like second ( whom i think prince sounds like ) melodic solo til insane ending him screaming like banshee then it fades into most controvesial song whole album , " darling nikki " ( reason there parental advisory tags every album)is visit hotel see girl who ' sex fiend ' song while quite tame today still only gets played late night because lyric mastrubastion . i always thought guitars led zeppelin vibe time but i listened more black alternative albums it sounds like funkadelic it prime . side two ( i know i am still doing vinyl thing ) where you really see spritual side come out opener ' when doves cry ' musical artistic acheivement it lack bassline song sounds like sexual peacan woman , but it actually hwo one dominates or gives up control their interpersonal romantic relationships really cold dark lyrics lament " this what it sounds like when doves cry " even when prince not singing sex it bleeds through lyrics it really sad song many ways but guitar brillance keeps song lite . " i would die 4 u " great pop/funk song faith under quise sexuality god woman , man or something you can't even fathom . me my friends couldn't believe time prince talking god all those mainfestions chrous " i would die 4 u baby i'm star actually most classic minneapolis sounding song those classic keyboard vamps chant " doctor " dr. fink great keyborad solo then finale " purple rain " which he takes marvin gaye staple remdemption where he ties but impluses but marries them godly realm it lyrically double endtree you say he talk himself woman savoiur but it also power god into one life . after watching movie concert you realize years later this album it heart ode god sex like many his classic albums but it greatest christian rock album all time because unlike those christian rock bands , they never touch world they always trying run away those issues their makes their music nothing but empty platitudes unlike prince who like bob marley marvin gaye embraced scared profane came out masterwork ages .	1
where this one fits : slow wonder follows new pornographers ' mass romantic electric version , but precedes twin cinema . it transition frenetic power-pop first two np albums deeper , more timeless quality their latest . without burden np " sound " live up , newman stretches , writes ballads pink floyd-y space out songs ( though always concise ) , if anything gets more pet sounds-like his musical arrangements ( gorgeous trumpet " come crash , " driving , rhythmic cello " town halo " ) . newman , quite obviously , very prolific his batting average stunningly high . it okay me if he mixes solo albums his np output , using them places experiment new kinds songs he thinks maybe his np fans won't cotton . but this album full hits , just melodic just many " how he ? " high-wire assemblages melody , rhythm arrangement np delivers . if you like new pornographers , you'll joyous hearing " table , " " mystery drug , " " secretarial " my favorite " town halo . " a.c. newman rapidly becoming most valuable pop artist planet , keeper great tradition pop/rock songwriters nearly died out .	1
i , like other reviewers , stumbled upon this release absolute joy . ( far i know , there virtually no promotion this 2 cd set . ) i immediately bought it , went home , listened whole thing . i not disappointed . set packaged nicely two cd , two hours ' worth music . set always comes nice booklet beautiful pictures sarah during mirrorball tour , it also includes lyrics all included songs , which nice bonus one usually doesn't see concert release . usual , sarah voice stunning . fact , most songs this set completely eclipse studio versions ( " hold " comes mind first ) . there not many live concert cds i actually buy , simply because not every musician sounds good live , but sarah exception all means . it extremely nice now complete concert all 23 tracks . this set definitely worth price admission . sarah fans , this now essential piece your music collection , even casual sarah listeners highly enjoy this concert ( my mom loved it ! ) . one reviewer previously mentioned , most tracks " seamed " together , i too wish ( though it completely personal thing ) they would gone non-seamed approach this set ( most songs sort just blend into next ) , but please note you get hear sarah interact audience share her insights few songs several occasions throughout two cds . all all , get your hands this soon you ; it'll blow your mind away	1

what eye opener rest world . what beautifuland pulsating blend music .	1
i'm not bts fanatic . i've never followed them around country , looked up anything doug martsch personal life internet , or any other weird , obsessive behavior concerning band . i simply really like their music . i own albums " perfect now " ( their best , imho ) this one . all four fantastic , honestly any them could your favorite . " perfect " lengthy indie/prog rock . " keep it like secret " more loud indie poppish . " ancient melodies " pop , but dry production cool , low-fi feel . finally , " you reverse " all out jam album . bts stays fairly true many their past formulas ; up-tempo , obvious opening track ( going against your mind ) , radio-friendly ballad track 3 ( liar ) , killer lead single elsewhere ( conventional wisdom ) , mellow closer ( wait ) . this regard , it very similar " ancient melodies . " biggest change focus riffs . yes , some those riffs end up sounding like neil young , but remember their version " cortez , killer " live album ? band abvious affinity young , lot their typical sound indebted him , so no big surprise . end , lot sound album pretty similar . if you can't get into it track five , there little hope you'll like rest . but those us who enjoy album , it excellent music . overall : 7 out 10	-1
dylan goes country he it well . this record far too short . good songs here , but not enough them . it seems like you've just put cd player it over . but other than fact there isn't much music here normal dylan cd , i no complaints . dylan fine voice here , sort country , high pitched twang works very nicely . he tells these songs love loss such sincerity , such honesty . but then he attacks everything he way , so it should no surprise . this just wonderful , if bit too short , record	1
" cookie : anthropological mixtape " album released 2002 possibly artist most commercially accessible album . it fused rap soul subjects politics relationships . it also ndegeocello most explicit album . her last album " bitter " cannot compared any way this offering it completely different style music . i respect ndegeocello , she able change her style her own ease successfully make amazing album . 1 . " dead nigga blvd . ( pt . 1) " - great opener album which good message . her voice hard she raps this song . very good . 2 . " hot night " - catchy political song . it sung well ndegeocello raps also good . background music very well . 3 . " interlude : blah blah blah , dyba dyba dyba " - i don't like interludes so this one annoys me . 4 . " priorities 1-6 " - nice song . great opening nice message . 5 . " pocketbook " - i find this song weaker one album but it still great . i just don't understand why it main single because there better tracks album . still it good ( though instrumentation isn't great ! ) . 6 . " berry farms " - great song same sex relationship didn't work out because other girl denying she knew ndegeocello . great , everything great this track . 7 . " trust " - most sexual song i've heard ndegeocello . it good instrumentation ( especially piano ) ndegeocello vocals like silk . beautiful track . 8 . " akel dama ( field blood) " - acts more poem than song . i love it because it very well written makes perfect sense . this writing its best . " truly reborn you would gouge out your eyes cut out your tongue cry like baby thats snatched away . " 9 . " earth " - brilliant song . instruments good touch add song . ndegeocello sounds beautiful . 10 . " better pound " - great . little less serious than last few tracks placed good part album . it sounds quite spacey , like it belongs her next album " comfort woman " but works well here . 11 . " criterion " - good instrumentation but i don't like start where you hear her puffing cigar because it encourages stereotyping kinda lot everyone else . song developes though very beautiful . 12 . " god . fear . money " - great song funky feel it . lyrics so good make you think . 13 . " jabril " - my favourite track album it feels personal beautiful . ndegeocello voice pure easy listen ! lyrics amazing instrumentation great . this song alone worth purchase cd ( though rest cd also excellent ! ) . this could my favourite ndegeocello song overall which saying lot i love all her work . 14 . " dead nigga blvd . ( pt . 2)- not great first part but still very well . 15 . " interlude : 6 legged griot trio ( weariness) " - i'll honest say i've never actually listened this interlude because i usually don't see them worthy ! 16 . " pocketbook ( rockwilder missy elliott remix) " - not good original simple fact redman ruins song . overall i think this brilliant album . i only complain " pocketbook " remix interlude near start ( i can't really complain last one i never listened it ) . other than it nearly perfect album . i can't say its ndegeocello strongest effort all hers so strong none them sound same . i would strongly advise anyone buy this album any ndegeocello . i would advise you all start " peace beyond passion " though this album takes while get into ! mark- 9/10	1

most likely . danny elfman composed something here so beautiful , so overwhelming , so rooted fantasy but filled melancholy , not only it perfectly serve film but pretty much greatest film score soundtrack around . tracks such storytime , ice dance , unsurpassed grand finale leave you stunned . orchestra choir come together perfectly . if you don't this cd you missing out something very special .	1

first , i'd like say you don't need into " dark " or goth music love this . how i didn't know dresden dolls before buying this i'll never know . first track this excellent compilation , " coin operated boy " single video their first official release . it excellent take cabaret , dresden dolls often , it funny voice instrumentation excellent . amanda plays just enough form make it sound extremely fresh . me , best song compilation . then there nicki jaine , who i heard , her collaboration projekt black tape mastermind sam rosenthal revue noir . i really want full-length revue noir , second track truly excellent . i think nicki marlene deitrich/dagmar krause ( but not much acquired taste ) natural her style music , her solo track here , " pretty faces " very strong make you want buy her solo album ( which you won't find here , but i think you guess where look ) . next new artist me jill tracy . she amazing voice . there few almost too-typical goth ( or really dark cabaret ) lyrics , but somehow she pulls it off . hearing this song enough make me want her cd . i'd also never heard katzenjammer kabarett , i'm not sure if they full length yet . but they should , because their track simply great . they alter female vocalist voice , but only so it sounds distant , or maybe voice past . she sings very well , instrumentation definitely cabaret , though it somehow dark playful both . audra i'm familiar , i've never huge fan . first jarring part this male voice , altered very audra way ( though radio or just enough fuzz make you wonder where he coming ) . first take , i thought they should left this off album , but it really catches your mind . i'm not sure i'll buying audra album soon , but if someone plays me one good this track , i could wrong . just bit more beat , bit more electronics , male voice , track comes right time break up album keep it going . female vocals pretty balanced seem echo almost empty cabaret , piano work perfect song . she tends start quiet occasionally build stronger sound , so you listen closely . i'd never heard them either , but i think i need little more exposure . i hope sam , who i adore , won't too unhappy my next statement . sound this black tape mix great , admittedly , but lyric " knock three times your coffin if you want my love " just turned me off . it comes across catchy way , but lyrics whole seem too cliche . male voice great instrumental song well placed order , i'll say . this coming devout black tape fan , so you should just see this nit-picking , probably . not their best song . next track , brides , adds some different instrumentation without going into electronic world ( i think ) , woman voice fits this album . i wouldn't say it one my favorites , but again , it well-placed , you won't skip over it . quite frankly , i'd given up rozz williams quite while ago . but this sparse song , actually moving well-modulated voice simple piano , pretty damn good . coming near end , again , well-placed . thoushaltnot track , male vocalist , definitely weimar style cabaret poisonous tone . it ends album well , though if you this cd your car or auto-repeat let it go back incredible " coin operated boy , " i think you'll happier . all all , price this album one all time bargains . you may not familiar single artist here yet you'll love it want three or four albums people here . production excellent , artwork beautiful cabaret temptress perfect , i can't recommend this any more highly than i , which basically , buy it , you won't disappointed . probably projekt best sampler ever , if you're familiar them i am , that saying lot . i hope " dark cabaret " becomes term becomes genre , because it would make me very happy	1

this one best examples music produced west coast latter half 60 . unlike so many other " psych " albums this one holds together superbly - every track merit . songs wide range diversity - rocking " somebody love " , country " my best friend " , raucous " 3/5 mile " , acid laden " white rabbit " haunting tracks " today " " comin ' back me " . musicianship excellent singers both solo harmony work great effect - what voice grace slick this album . if you interest music want add classic album your collection then you could lot worse than buy this one	1
almost long i've listened arch enemy latest studio album , _anthems rebellion_ , song " dead eyes see no future " my favorite piece band . fierce rhythms drumming ( one daniel erlandsson best performances , i think ) , grim vocals ( i still can't get over how effective angela gossow voice , knowing it belongs woman ! ) , one most amazing guitar riffs i've ever heard my entire life ( bridge , when michael amott soloing ) , all only few things i like song . so when i heard it going lead track ep release , i course psyched . granted , ep seemed like it'd something only hardcore arch enemy fans ( myself included ) would want go out their way get , but when i received this christmas 2005 , i no idea it would this good . after title track , there three live performances " burning angel " ( my immediate second-favorite song arch enemy - i usually don't pick favorites ) , " we rise , " " heart darkness , " recorded during paris leg their _anthems_ tour . live performances definitely seem better setting angela . her voice deeper , harsher , more menacing , not mention she uses ( or least these songs , used ) lot more range her voice . this only bodes well naysayers who whine angela not right voice death metal - just wait until they release album , she'll no doubt real monster ! then there song covers . starting them off megadeth " symphony destruction . " i've fan megadeth few years now , when i heard this song going covered arch enemy , i nearly fainted . like any good cover should like , it retains much original song message overall vibe , but adds it ; arch enemy guitars add crushing brutality now-famous riffs created great dave mustaine . drumming overpowering , course , angela voice simply scary . she follows original song vocal patterns well , too - this obvious when she pronounces " acting like robot " " mrracting like robot , " just like how mustaine . i'm not familiar band manowar , so i can't really judge cover their track " kill power , " but nonetheless stands well arch enemy song . " incarnated solvent abuse " cover song grindcore heroes melodeath forefathers carcass . because michael amott used play guitar band , it makes cover interesting nostalgic tribute . finally , there video track " we rise " included multimedia section cd . considering cheap price , this album far more than average ep . i'd recommend it anyone looking get into gossow-era arch enemy , well any fan band . it quite treat	1

butthole surfersin 1983 surfers born their debut ep . record starts off delightfully vulgar song shah sleeps lee harvys grave . it then takes 180 degree turn entertaining hey , followed butthole classic " something " , song apparently gibby hanyes(singer ) how he gonna get back his girlfriend ( violently ) . now before gibby invented gibbytronix , he would play saxophone certain songs , like something bar pope . next song wichita cathedral probably my least favorite song record , its basically gibby rambling how he got drunk wichita . now i tell you now any dead kennedys fan would like next song suicide , very punk . ep then closes revenge anus presley . it easily my favorite song whole album . whether its fear or humor you seeking this song get job . it actually starts out gibby speaking tongues . now if one play it backwards we would hear part " shah " when gibby yells " there time live time die , i smoke elvis presley toenails , when i wanna get high . this ep goes several names such " brown reason live " , pee pee sailor(thats actually name or drawing cd ) butthole surfers . last actually right one . live pcppepin 1984 , surfers released live follow up self title . it starts gibby saxophone cowboy bob , tune later appear " sac " . it then continues better version bar pope , its better cause gibby rambling several things chorus verse . next song simply puzzles me . dance cobras simply paul fooling his guitar weird snake noises background , total 34 seconds . it never appears later albums only found here , so what it ? it just . nothing . we then hear hilarious version shah sleeps lee harvey grave . halfway through song speakers give out few seconds one side concert . we then given idea kind crappy conditions surfers " enjoy " . end we hear gibby audience telling each other shut up . then we hear live versions wichita cathedral , hey something , all excellent . bonus tracks !!!! if 2 ep not sweet enough , surfers added 2 song encore , which consists gary floyd-another song appear ' sac ' matchstick . before gary floyd starts we subject hilarious plead gibby audience , come up butthole , butthole chant . then we track sinister crayon , which put vinyl version humpty dumpty lsd contains saxophone . album closes demo version something . song actually becomes little tiresome when you hear it third time one cd , but it great , none less . this great cd surfers should every fan collection , unless you only heard electric larryland weird revolution , then i would suggest going into some other stuff first	1

this album , spite leaning heavily towards pop side countrypop , produced sung simple manner , which gives it breezy , effortless feel makes it very comfortable listen without lightweight silly . it`s perfect popcountry album all ages all occasions , filled sing-along choruses infecteous hooks . this , my humble (?) opinion , best martina mcbride album date , precious gem which i never grow tired	1

i thought this excellent cd due fact there lead singer khan , excellant voice . no small thing now most popular hard driving bands now singers can`t sing lick . giving example bad bands out there korn system downor drone if you . check these guys out if you you getting tired same old bs . these guys rock but still get mellow . check out song don`t you cry , great song	-1
this cd isn't bad .... its just too predictable most mariah jingles . " never too far " best track my opinion	-1
past never really into thrice due my intense hatred anything whiney . this changed immediately i came upon their performance " earth shake " youtube - one best live videos i've seen lately . not many bands evolve progress this fast their entire careers , let alone one album next . throw out some comparisons you never hear anywhere else : mix tightness rush , snazzy guitar licks drive , beautiful atmosphere u2 or coldplay xy , great , important hardcore cave in " until your heart stops " mature lyrics take themselves seriously without overly pretentious . wow , i like this . some really good production , too . actually , only qualm i this record it so polished some ( just one or two ) parts almost sound like backstreet boys ....	1
times change - what goes out style often very subjective period time we . while tom always maintain core legion fans - if you go back late 1970s early 1980s mention name tom jones , you probably would laughed . however if you went back 1960s , tom jones extremely devoted following . same time , it also seems tom jones somehow gone through renaissance 2000s . people now getting into tom jones again . it not like there this great 1960s cultural renewal - it just tom jones music suddenly come today . although this shot dark , one reason why i think there renewed interest tom jones because success " austin powers " movies . whatever it , when i hear sounds music austin powers - it immediately reminds me tom music . one collection snapshot tom work late 1960s early 1970s collection , " best tom jones " . i think there several reasons why tom jones still appeal 21st century . main reason tom unique baritone voice . tom vocals some strongest music business . whether its pop , dance - or even country techno , tom always found ability adapt his style many different music variants . tom music also some very interesting sounds . one reason i think " austin powers " because tom music movie music almost psychedelic " pop sound " . finally , i think tom strength live performer really helped solidify his appeal . tom somewhat gregarious style stage made him one most frequent recipients women undergarments stage - even today . " best tom jones " pretty good job content collection . it includes 21 classic tracks 1965 through 1974 also includes tom 1989 remake prince " kiss " . i prefer my greatest hits collections chronological order - this allows me see how artist progressed over time . most part ( few exceptions ) , " best tom jones " comes pretty close going chronological order . one example this " puppet man " released " she lady " album , yet it included after songs like " letter lucille " " young new mexican puppeteer " released after " puppet man " . but most part , you get sense how tom progressed . far tom jones collections go , there most certainly no shortage greatest hits collections . here some more popular ones : - " 20th century masters - millennium collection : best tom jones " : this only contains 12 tracks . all twelve these tracks included " best tom jones " . this not chronological order . - " gold " : this more comprehensive collection tom hits . this two-cd collection containing 42 songs . it doesn't include remake " kiss " . it also missing " chills fever " " somethin bout you baby i like " . - " reloaded : greatest hits " : collection 19 tom hits include duets contemporary artists . - " definitive tom jones 1964-2002 " : this most comprehensive tom jones collection out there . this boxed set includes 93 tracks . this contains all songs " best tom jones " exception " somethin bout you baby i like " . - " complete tom jones " : this older collection contains 20 tracks . all songs this collection exception " move closer " included " best tom jones " . overall , while i still know there more comprehensive collections than " best tom jones " , most part i pleased . collection offers some classic tom jones ' tunes such " it not unusual " " she lady " ( latter my favorite tom song ) . this collection one few feature song " somethin bout you baby i like " . although tom some " country " albums 1980s , this particular song demonstrated tom could actually adapt country-music style . i also pleased inclusion " young new mexican puppeteer " - guy wales , this song sure terrific tex-mex flair it . despite inclusion " kiss " , i'm bit disappointed some more tom covers not included - most notably , i would liked see few tom live cuts included . liner notes this collection mixed bag . positive side , there terrific 2-panel write-up listed " extract legend tom jones volume 1 " this write-up basically chronicles early part tom career . i found this very informative . negative side , there little way credits . you aren't told when songs released , you aren't told studio musicians , songwriting credits , what albums songs . there also no lyrics - but greatest hits collections , it typical they not included . overall , i'd look see what best value you get your money terms selecting tom jones compilation . based this , you still may want look " gold " or " definite tom jones " boxed set . however , this collection still stands solid its own tom jones compilation . it great job capturing tom peak period - highly recommended	-1

put it lightly , this one most devastating funk albums all time . changes tempo mood , played feeling groove . this album should mandatory every american , it should given each citizen their 18th birthday ! presidential debates should include cut-by-cut commentary what politicials feel this album	1
i checked this cd out library i'm so glad i before wasting my money this . miss saigon terrible story full phony emotions static , unsatisfying score . music lacks variety forgettable ( other words , many songs sound same ) . story cliche romeo-and-juliet type " star-crossed lovers " who go through so much when they hardly even know each other . top it , singing isn't good . i cannot comprehend why everyone so fascinated lea salonga . her voice so weak , she tries hard sound strong , but it just doesn't sound good . i never liked jonathan pryce his more-talk-than-sing- voice , but role engineer should more gut strength . simon bowman sounds like classically-trained singer trying sing pop style . two styles completely different should not mixed because , well , it just sounds bad . claire moore peter polycarpou only two performers who demonstrate great vocal ability . however , their roles aren't big kim , engineer , or chris , so even they couldn't save this doomed album . i know this show huge success many people love it , but it just tries too hard reach emotional depth it just fails so many levels .	-1
man oh man , definetly classic times . i am hip hop head listening rap since before many my friends kissing girls . this cd reigns top my lists . it fact this some most classic west coast material ever . all tupac material classic material i over 2 gigs his music my laptop i never skip his songs . don't get it twisted , all eyez me thugged out party ridah bumper , me against world lonely ambitious 2pac , but this cd shows something world never seen before . first all changing his alias makaveli raises many questions . he bringing new deepness meaning his music . he actually incorporating political messages calling all his listeners action demand change . jada right , if 2pac still alive , even if biggie killed 2pac lived , all these wack fools today rap game would asking , you want fries ? haha i love it because it just too true . every track this cd cut . majority songs absolute best beats i ever heard , but 2pacs lyrical ability makes even decent beat tracks classical rap material . early mid 1990 golden era rap hip-hop . this brought terrible end killings 2 kings ( we all know who ) . when i listen this cd , i feel though i am listening person who alsmot super-human , which why i refer 2pac miracle man . only thug this stature could brought such ugly end . go see ressurection you understand what i mean . this cat not know how make bad song . just remeber when you hear 2pac rapping rhyming , you listening higher power coming through human form . if this cd came out instead all eyez me when pac out prison , i would sold even more than all eyez , but just how story go . book like bible could written this man his ideology . but enough ho hum got out get this damn thing !	1
forget history , background , drama , analysis , this music smokes . it groves , it burns , it makes you want dance , it makes you want listen , it provides heat , light , electricity too . two bands smoking . this hotest straight ahead head arrangement swing either group played period . this what makes bands which otherwise overly arranged precision units time this cd made , smoke . production values these tracks must quite low : get two bands studio , get minimum number tracks going , find some tunes blues based standard progressions , let rhythm sections bounce , let soloists rip . rip , rip rip rip away they , it takes long time listening figure out who who what what , time you dont care . you just want beat go , bands keep wailing you don't care whether it count basie duke ellington , or frosty snowman . i am not much new testament or ellington 1960s but you need this groove	-1
" older " may album his gets lost mix , but if you're fan his any way , it well worth listen . despite taking six years release , it typical george michael , therefore wonderful . included upbeat songs like " fastlove " " star people " , well slower moving ones such " you loved " " jesus child " . i also enjoy " strangest thing " " forgiven " . even though george star 20 years now , i still feel he slightly underrated artist . each album his leaves me impressed . if this album doesn't hook you right away , give it try sometime , perhaps when you're " older " .	-1

" farewell , farewell " beautiful piece this cd not dvd . " beannacht o ri haoine " ( blessings king friday , meaning tgif type fridays pub ) much stronger offering dvd gorgeous bouzouki lead . similarly " county down " great cd but stronger excellent dvd bouzouki lead . i would also say donnchadh gough much stronger both irish drum ( bodhran ) ulienne ( elbow bellows ) bagpipes dvd . macahill reel medley chosen start off number one track cd when played concert big man ripping through very fast paced reel hair flying bouncing his chair . finally there need mention 5 tracks unique this cd only well worth listening . all normal standards , this very good cd worth 5 stars . measuring 2003 danu against 2006 danu ( worth 6 stars )) however , leads respect those three years young band accepting new band member developing strong friendship chemistry over past three years one polished , best bands now setting standard traditional irish music . slainte !

vangelis released many fascinating albums over years but many ways he never topped this unique electronic score ridley scott blade runner . it unfortunate musician talented vangelis sometimes lumped into eternally derided category " new age " music because vangelis so much more than many hacks who inhabit new age domain . vangelis magician synth-textures instance his melodic gifts quite rare . almost all tracks here great , atmospheric energetic , man it all . this music makes film better it course stands it own quite magnificiently , which what every film composer strives create . vangelis much more than just film composer but it interesting he achieves much his best work working various films blade runner probably best particular category . tiny asking price , there no way blade runner soundtrack should missing your collection . if you crave more this melodically inclined electronic master , check out his albums , " opera sauvage " " direct "	1

during first several years 80 teena marie seldom made musical misstep . her four albums preceeded this brilliant but all failed cross over pop audience-'starchild ' . one big reason might dancable opener " lovergirl " , her biggest hit song most people associate her . musically this album very much follow up ' robbery ' minus loose concept plus more concerted effort write songs tuneful pop oriented . one thing seperates ' starchild ' rest teena maries catalog up until this point complete lack jazz latin musical references . all music this recording either soul ballads , funk or dance-pop . case ' beat crazy ' " help youngblood get freaky party " brilliant " jammin " rap hip-hop musical base . " alibi ' similar structure big hit-something often happens pop albums . it two ballads i believe album almost becomes too predictable . both nearly identicle structure while " we've got stop ( meeting like this ) " make some excellent lyrical points long distance relationships music doesn't really achieve transcendance . title cut superb slice mid 80 funk far most grooving ' song ' album . " my dear mr. gaye " very interesting tribute . first her cosmic lyric matched ( again)to dull sounding ballad . then midway through song structure changes mimic marvin gaye own ' what going ' era sound tribute becomes more obvious . final cut brief gospel piano reference . while ' starchild ' emphasizes smooth rb doesn't any more exotic musical features teena marie previously accociated album find artist place showing her ability remain true her art while accesible broader pop audience . since this also her biggest selling release she certainly succeeded . even though longtime fan her early music might find this polished recording something shock , everyone else this probably this album most fully explores her grasp pop , rb , funk soul great first place get introduction teena marie music	1

it always strange me hear reproductions work where original needs no improvement . i tremendous respect these musicians , yes , they play some great solos over changes , but album basically just recreation tracks excellent vince guaraldi trio records . my personal favorite " linus tells charlie " which features some very sensitive trumpet chris botti , but otherwise this records just little off , i find myself listening only originals these days . original band vince piano just grooves better , although recording perspective sonically slightly inferior ( they probably mixing tv ) something those original performances seem more emotional ... it just nostalgia ? if you looking some fantastic recreations old tv music ( e.g. little rascals , looney tunes , etc ... ) newer bands , check out beau hunks ' material . superb playing excellent attention classic details nuances original scores	-1

there some very nice tunes here great riffs licks learn if youre guitarist . you tell jimmy page eric clapton ate this stuff up ! unfortunately , his vocals often distorted . seems if no one else really seems matter , so take my review grain sal t.t hese recordings made 50 years ago dont sound bad any means , but thats why it got 4 stars only . i realize they may not too many resources use recourding these tracks back 1956 , but this probably fault engineer . distorted guitar work if thats what youre going , but when vocals distorting then its time turn down level ! otis rush sounds great here though ... i cant recommend something else sounds better - so go ahead pick this up . dont expect super high fidelity though	-1

paraphrase recent truck commercial , quot;it big , tough funk album . what not like ? quot ; if you're modern music producer , please yourself favor listen drums this album . they're back bit mix but still pop , snare doesn't sound like grand canyon but it got ring it , cymbals stay out way everything else while still aggressive . quite frankly , just every modern drum quot ; soundquot ; i've heard , rock anemic junk passes funk these days jazz , gutless wonder comparison . quot ; metallicquot ; snare sound that so popular these days ( rock recordings everyone pearl jam 311 no doubt every so-called quot ; punkquot ; band radio ) sucks . it just , it not musical , it too quot ; openquot ; focus groove . get over it , please , let us know when you've got it right . whoever produces queens stone age or cake chill , though , ' cause you're close . bit more snap some high-end blap you're there . you imagine how absolutely tough good punk band would sound drum kit recorded like meters recorded their drum kit ? i think you get gist i like this album . i've lived it long time now it never out crate ( i.e. , dj crate ) . i find excuses play cuts off this thing everywhere -- weddings , house parties , whatever . if dj saved your life , he probably it song this record one sampled it or other two meters albums ( quot ; metersquot ; , quot;struttin'quot;) this era . someone wake me up when modern quot ; rockquot ; or quot ; funkquot ; band sounds plays half this good . pay attention grooves quot ; funky miraclequot ; , quot ; look ka ka py pyquot ; , quot ; pungeequot ; . stuff much harder play than it sounds , no one i've heard it right besides meters themselves . there imitation funk bands out there these days trying cop old-school sound , but they don't chops pull it off . yourself favor savor real thing . meters it , this album definitively it	1

i first listened ' new miserable experience ' 1998 , my freshman year highschool . new fan light alternative rock , it right up my alley i superficially enjoyed catchy tunes . eight years passed i rediscovered ' new miserable experience ' . people analyzed songs this album over over these reviews , so i'll spare you just give my personal testament greatness it entirety . it used ( still ) represent my memories highschool now it represents , maybe , most prized jewel my music collection . this album even more applicable poignant today now i dealt adult situations like ones constructed songs ' new miserable experience ' . it definately some dark emotional themes , yet it somehow optimistic . learning appreciate this album masterpiece it wonderful experience . it truly set highest standard any band directly influenced gin blossoms , particularly , this album . it really ' alpha ' or ' king ' sub-genre they've pioneered " arizona rock " . one certainly draw conclusion edgier , less refined sound ' refreshments ' their genius debut album strongly influenced gin blossoms . if you add ' new miserable experience ' ' fizzy fuzzy big buzzy ' together you get strong core this ' arizona rock ' . fourth generation arizona native , i find some sense pride such wonderful music originate here . i hope see those beginnings continue evolve new bands new records . i'll keep my eyes open .	1

nick cave powerful artist who not afraid take risk . working bands like current 93 , he proven himself both experimental versatile artist . but i think he might somewhat imposing musical force ( this good thing fans ! ) . staying just out limelight , though he certainly welcome within it , nick cave music dark beautiful . i think this album introduces his material well not simple providing timeline but mix material several albums no regard release date . this great first album get into nick cave great compilation hardened nick cave fan . best part this album it each song very listenable approachable . " red right hand " " carny " " her eternity " tracks all really diverse yet flow very well album . sounds dark , dynamic cool but each great energy strong emotion . overall i think this album well worth money . it one best " best " albums i experienced not just tracks individuals but great artistry which songs arranged . if you want get first nick cave album this one if you all studio albums get this well you enjoy it great car album or pre-made compilation caves work . -- ted muren	1

although this still best turntable album date , it doesn't quite demonstrate just how good m.m.m. . he could probably put out album almost good one live performance . if you've seen him live , you know what i mean . nonetheless , most songs interesting first listen , seem improve subsequent inspection . first half far superior second ... there kind deterioration into simple bass-bumping ( perfect all you bazooka tube/rockford fosgate types ) . all all , well worth money . if you want smooth mood music , stick dj shadow . if you want strapped slab vinyl chucked into space , pick up anti-theft device	-1

its easy see where mastodon gotten their elevated status above most modern metal acts ; cleverly woven hooks , plenty diversity never over-done , ear devastating heaviness , mastodon ' remission ' fits perfectly genious their later efforts . besides putting extremely intense live show , mastodon offer relentless barrage originality served side dish extra-heavy grooves all their releases , including ' remission ' . ' march fire ants ' first song i ever heard these guys , relapse records compilation ' contaminated vol . 5 ' , needless say , i thouroughly attracted songs intricate structure heaviness , accompanied deep , crunchy distortion this album potrays . entire album chock filled songs vary beautifully each other , but not so much give this album too diverse feel . this , after all , heavy metal . all heavy , all gut wrenching groove strictly mastodon . if you loved ' levathian ' , and/or ' blood mountian ' then you damn well better get this .	1

i first exposed oysterhead hbo " reverb ; " i instantly intrigued what i heard . well over year later , i picked up their cd . i not disappointed . after few listens , i can't avoid stating some lyrical stylings remind me syd barret early pink floyd days . without doubt , these musicians created their own music style , but there comparison made . there dark , psychedelic sound lures listener edges discomfort into center unknown . there references lyrics teeter esoteric , but it not detract experience . what i remember " reverb " performance , oysterhead more compelling live than studio . i eagerly await dvd live performance	-1

long time fan sp nearly decade now , i really never found anything interesting band after 94 " process . " even when " greater wrong right " released ... mind you i believe every artist message any material they release , but after hearing clips " mythmaker " i knew i needed own it- any cost ! sp taken their music back their roots added twist . i've heard some negative remarks " mythmaker " especially hook , " jessus wants ugly " too repetetive or annoying , but since when industrial music ever supposed pleasant anyway ? anyone saying anything bad this album clearly needs re-think mass produced crap music industry puts out today or just hit button any radio tune into any station see what annoying or repetetive really means	1
paul oakenfold got his start record producer dj , but this album he gained true worldwide attention . heck , who didn't hear great song " starry-eyed surprise " booming out their radio ? well , i loved song , so i get hold album . album itself mixed bag all sorts different sounding tunes . there frenetic " ready steady go " , soulful " southern sun " , languid " zoo york " , lot more . only track i cannot understand them adding " nixon spirit " . i mean , who wants dance some guy droning voice ? but , said this great album , lot really interesting tunes . i love this album , highly recommend it !	-1

this album acceptably faithful first three , not easy level achieve . rusty hyperness not here kick this thing into overdrive where they used play , but it comes close enough able suddenly turn around look cd cover positioned top turntable other side room when disc playing say aloud , " holy #### , it cactus ! " " day night , " " electric blue , " " jazzed " especially reminescent old style . kunes very good singer fits well . pratt harp helps maintain cactus flavor . only thing this album needed cover something out old blues canon somebody like willie dixon , howlin ' wolf , elmore james , etc ., list endless . " brother bill " " evil " superb renditions , covering one or two would probably put this album over top . i like " blues mr. day " because i make up lyrics sing them it while i'm cooking breakfast or whatever run them past rusty my head .

teena marie 1986 album quot ; emerald cityquot ; caused critics fans alike scratch their heads confusion . teena yesteryear , rick james protoge , soulful powerhouse behind heart-on-your-sleeve balladry like quot ;d ear loverquot ; seemed taken vacation release quot ; emerald city . quot ; here teena marie whipped her voice around driving funk quot ; lips find u , quot ; who head-banged conviction hard rock singer quot ; you so heavy , quot ; who evoked images torch singer days gone quot ; sunny skies . quot ; quot ; emerald city , quot ; featuring poem chronicling emotions character , quot ; pity , quot ; through theros misunderstood , ( not mention dark cover image teena guitar surrounded eerie green backdrop ) , both hinted this album going something else . it . while not commercially successful previous work , quot ; emerald cityquot ; featured quot ; ivory queen soulquot ; making album , she said interviews , herself . music , bit dependent mid-80 synth production , sound little dated . even so , what makes these cuts memorable way teena sings them : conviction , sass , style . she wraps her vocals around atmospheric , hypnotic quot ; shangri-la , quot ; or scats her way through delicious lyricism quot ; sunny skies , quot ; teena marie deftly showcases her musical tastes excelles each genre she shares listener . quot ; batucada suite , quot ; breathless romp into latin music african percussion , features teena evoking musical heritages many lands , last proclaiming quot ; jesus music heaven-sent , remind us what went . quot ; ( this just goes show teena knack wordplay coupled intense musicality still remains her biggest strength ) . teena writes her own lyrics , she get away such word puzzles , not mention her writing far outshines quot ; baby i love youquot ; same-ness her contemporaries . whole , album runs gamut marie musical influences , ranging psychadelic-stylings title track , familiar funk quot ; once not enoughquot ; quot ; lips find u , quot ; brooding surprise quot ; you so heavy , quot ; spanish-style quot ; batucada suite , quot ; what arguably teena biggest musical strength , jazz ballad quot ; sunny skies , quot ; which lyrically brilliant features saxaphone work bradford marsalias . though underrated , this album worth listening , not once ( you'll think it wierd ) but over over ( you'll find it creative , inspired musical journey through one soul music most talented interpreters ) . intense , surprising , soulful , inspired : quot ; emerald cityquot ; showcases teena marie far-reaching musical scope , illustrating she remains artist true sense word	1

reviews i read ( not all ) , i not see mention what excellent job columbia remastering . i owned lp when it first issued it lifelong favorite ; so it very pleasant surprise hear how much sound improved this release . ( whole series recent columbia remasterings excellent . ) legendary performance ? oh yeahhh , missing voice america tape , philly jo jones driving band ( apocryphally ) rolled up newspaper , dancing blonde black dress who got crowd their feet roaring during gonsalves solo . time cover , renaissance band . performance easily supports weight legends ... format this release , complete studio recordings appended , very interesting ; it corrects completes historical record . it good hear studio recordings , now seeming oversmooth plump , comparison real thing . i consider it essential recording .	1

released 1974 , this grateful dead eight studio album 12th album release overall . original cd 44 minutes long but bonus material gets it up close 80 minutes . like all remastered grateful dead cd , sound quality excellent . it enhanced hdcd sound . i just bought cd player hdcd decoder , this sounds stunning . hdcd 24 bit recording vs . normal 16 bit regular cd . it played back normal cd player , sounds better than normal cd . but , you get best improvement if you cd player hdcd . like all remastered grateful dead cd , this bonus material take it up 80 minutes . quality bonus material hit miss . instance , it poor american beauty . blues allah , bonus material compliments original music enhances whole disc . if there any doubts before , bonus material , this definitely five star disc . i also like there approximately 10 second gap original bonus material , seperate two . this comes nice cardboard case , unlike most cardboard cases , plastic tabs hold cd sturdy not snap off . this part second boxset remastered dead cd . unlike first set , this cd not booklet extensive liner notes . extensive info cd contained book comes boxset , but not available if you buy individual cd . blues allah complex work really flows together start finish . although there seperate distinct songs , it all plays like one long suite . bonus material mostly instrumentals follows same music flow . this terrapin station dead foray into quasi progress rock style . but , same time , it mellow but bright sounding atmosphere , similar wake flood . after this album recorded , band went great american music hall san francisco played live show included all songs this album . it captured double cd , one vault . unlike what said , i don't think live version good this tight wonderfully recorded studio version . also , i heard other live versions blues allah really spacy go hour . i would like official cd release one those shows	1

those who read 3 most recent reviews i posted - i flatter myself think anyone - it may appear i am some sort kinks kick . this true , but it not first such kick i . my curiousity subsequent fascination kinks first occurred 1999 . i immersed myself all music guide rock , i found many bands i knew very popular apparently released some very good albums i never heard . since i bit anglophile anyway , i decided begin expansion my musical horizons something else kinks . put it mildly , i impressed . my kinks collection quickly included all four band late 60s masterpieces . i read more reviews got know fellow fans , i realized many particular fondness 1968 record kinks village green preservation society . while i very pleased meet like-minded folks , i never thought vgps my personal favorite . i bigger fan something else arthur . i still am , but isn't say i don't love village green . i . it great unique album worthy its reputation . even though i am not fond it most fans , it good know it more listeners result reverence it received . vgps less concept album than arthur , but it strong song cycle all same . it holds together like illustrated anthology children stories . opening title track introduces album like greek chorus , setting presented picturesque songs " blue sky " , " sitting riverside " , " animal farm " , " village green " . diverse cast denizens pop up songs like peaked-in-high school tale " you remember walter ? " , soon inspire real-life punk rocker " johnny thunder " , " phenomenal cat " , " monica " , dave davies-sung " wicked annabella " , which introduces this idyllic village sinister element . finally , although it doesn't fit perfectly into record overall scheme , " all my friends there " one best songs here , expert bit songwriting ray davies . one must careful assessing davies ' fondness things past . while times it sincere , it other times ironic . after all , he only 24 when album released . ( isn't it also bit strange " picture book " recently used commercial promoting cutting-edge technology ? ) although it surely harmless time , lyrics like " we sherlock holmes english-speaking vernacular " might sound almost xenophobic some contemporary american ears , especially right-wingers like pat buchanan supporting idea english should america official language . perfectly honest , his nostalgia gets teensy bit tiresome certain parts record . after all , if village like he describes this record actually exists , surely it somewhere , then he must aware past always survive some form or , even if it gets psychologically further geographically farther away . but this very little subtract overall quality vgps , whose songs uniformly strong personal , which unique treasure start finish . ( unlike other kinks albums re-issued only handful excellent bonus tracks , vgps undergone extensive re-issuing . 2000 version presents 15-track album mono form , 12-track stereo version record it originally set released . mono version sounds bit muffled , while stereo version excludes few tracks , it also features two different ones : " mr. songbird " " days " , ray greatest compositions . apart these two treats , it difficult enthusiastically endorse this re-issue . depending one level interest , original 1968 version may preferrable . then again , if one simply cannot get enough vgps , there 2004 3-cd deluxe edition . fact this only kinks record receive such treatment further confirmation its enduring stature . )	-1
though it may not essential buy , this ep real treat die hard fans . ep begins single edit trigger . its shortened tad album version . track 2 where it gets good watch them feed , which rip roaring hard track . real gem track 3 which cover genesis land confusion . i curious how cover would sound my surprise it really good . some fans no doubt hate it but i dug it . after we get some really pointless remixes cloud connected moonshield . basically your gonna buy this ep two tracks , watch them feed land connfusion . fans like me , its worth every penny	-1

token ' idol ' singles like tradition , which each season singles cheesier than last . unfortunately bo , probably most ridiculous ' idol ' single given him carrie : ' inside your heaven . ' though lyrics don't make sense , i not only enjoy bo rendition but i prefer it carrie ( this coming carrie fan ) . 1 ) ' inside your heaven ' - 7/10 - although it nice sound it , lyrics so nonsensical song loses all potential classic . bo vocals pretty good , yet that probably it positives . 2 ) ' vehicle ' - 6.5 /10 - yes , bo moreso his element this track , but it still isn't great . not great , but still listenable . it sad what ' idol ' producers him trying make him something he not . you dress monkey up human clothes , but end day it still monkey . said , bo best he material provided i only hope he escapes grasp clive crew so he taken seriously	-1

greg brown heartland troubador , both literally metaphorically . based southeast iowa where he grew up , greg strong , deep voice sanity world gone mad . evening call powerful set 12 new songs , featuring brown gravelly baritone , acoustic guitar harmonica reliable accompaniment bo ramsey electric guitar ( plus bass , drums keyboards ) . if you've followed greg brown over years , you recognized his trajectory toward slower lower , closer earth , closer bone , closer heart , closer what real important . evening call takes us closest yet , grounding us earthy love matters soul , face rampant materialism our spiritually sick society world . four songs stand out consistently strong set -- " cold dark wet " downside , hell lovelessness . " bucket " sweet upside , one most perfect greg many songs . " kokomo " raunchy cautionary tale succumbing worldly temptations . " whippoorwill " sings love devotion . only number doesn't it me " eugene , " which isn't song , but rather spoken-word rambling ode camping fishing across us . greg takes his stand realm everday life , rooted here now . he all too aware wider world evidenced " treat each other right , " refrain " we got so evil , i feel troubled tonight . this old world brought us all here , so why can't we treat other right .

i won't use this space review incredible music john coltrane quartet . completely unnecessary ! some reviewers commentators dislike presentation pieces order their recording rather than organized albums . i think this minor quibble , especially considering transition lp-era cd-era already " mixed things up " considerably . example , modern cd issue album " transition " drops " dear lord " adds two pieces " kulu se mama . " " dear lord " shows up " dear old stockholm , " which not ' 60s coltrane album . " living space " -- current cd -- not exist then . some coltrane pieces ( " vilia " " dear old stockholm " ) released contemporary albums featuring numerous artists ( " definitive jazz scene , vols 1 , 2 3 " ) . posthumous albums " mastery john coltrane , volumes 1 2 " not all appear cd -- pieces diverted other cds . so , putting his works recording order makes sense me . few albums , such " sun ship , " quartet version " meditations " " love supreme , " appear this collection all tracks together . if you ipod mac , you " recreate " original albums , proper track order . boxed set limited studio recordings performed classic quartet ( few minor allowances drums bass ) , thus two pieces " impressions " missing -- you find them complete 1961 village vanguard set -- only two pieces " live birdland " included , example " alabama . " i wish they made exception included title track album " kulu se mama , " thus bringing album completely into this set . i agree it shame album covers original liner notes missing . i am glad i " love supreme " cd separately .	1
very raw . although similar later beth hart , songwriting isn't complex , nor songs jump you make you remember them . exception " blame moon " this effort good , but obviously freshman effort . still must bh fans	-1

i am huge fan classic broadway musicals . my opinion , my fair lady west side story tie #1 spot best musical all time . i've seen several productions lerner amd loewe loverly masterpiece , ; both professional community theatre , i enjoy collecting various recordings broadway musicals . both original cast recordings my fair lady west side story recorded columbia historic 30th street studios -- aswas this 1976 20th anniversary recording my fair lady . anniversary production achieved respectablerun 384 performances . goddard lieberson , who produced classic original 1956 broadway cast album , again serves producer here . this 20th anniversary recording used available my local public library . i grew up listening 1956 broadway cast album , but i remember also delighted " 20th anniversary . " i used own this version audio cassette tape . i delighted discover amazon.com offered " 20th anniverrsary " remastered cd , i purchased it immediately . first , i must praise didier . deutsch outstanding reissue digital remastering job he here countless other titles sony broadway masterworks . sound quality here sparkling crisp . lightening not exactly strike twice terms casting . those hoping higgins eliza equal magical theatrical partnership rex harrison julie andrews somewhat disappointed . ian richardson bloody annoying flat-out weird higgins . christine andreas , however , thrilling eliza . i know higgins supposed passionate proper pronouncation english language theexclusion all else -- but richardson habit over-emphasizing/over-pronouncing almost every single word musical phrase . overall effect -- there simply no other way describe it -- bizarre weird ! higgins snobby male chauvanist -- but i never thought him crackpot until i heard richardson again . alan jay lerner so wittily wrote his lyrics : " englishman way speaking absolutely classifies him . moment he talks , he makes some other englishman despise him ! " richardson performance proves this point perfectly . but even richardson going wildly over top never brings this recording down . there other compensations splendid performances galore . robert coote makes welcome return his original role col , pickering . he sounds like he hasn't aged aday . good old coote vital vibrant ever . i never fond freddy song " street where you live " ; feeling it just filler while actors portraying higgins eliza get dressed embassy ball . but jerry lanning ( adult " patrick " opposite angela lansbury original broadway cast " mame " ) sings it beautifully . george rose especially robust eliza drunk , garbage-man dad alfred . doolittle . i love how rose bursts into tears his final phrase , " i'm gettin ' married mornin ' . ding- dong ! bells ( sob ! sob ! ) -- ( complete crying collapse ) gonna chime ! " it perfection illustration old joke : : " what difference betweena wedding funeral ? " : " perception . " while julie andrews always definitive eliza doolittle ( her performance won rapturous reviews anddeservedly became theatrical legend ) , christine andreas , my opinion , only other eliza worthy enough follow her -- only other eliza worth listening recording . her performances " wouldn't it loverly ? " , " i could danced all night " , particularly , " show me , " outstanding . christine andreas musical phrasing dramatic emphasis show thorough complete understanding eliza . after emotional argument higgins start act two , eliza runs into street find love-struck freddy waiting her like puppy dog . caught chauvanist snob professor who refuses show her slightest human respect dim-wit suitor who not stop fawning over her , eliza explodes rage . christine andreas perfect she explodes freddy , " i get words all day through -- first him , now you ! all you blighters ? " short , whereas ian richardson goes miserably wrong henry higgins , christine andreas absolutely right eliza doolittle . this 20th anniversary recording still earns its place where it belongs -- shelf next classic 1956 broadway cast recording	-1

( quot ; damp-soundingquot ; saxophone section particularly superb job . ) though bea wain voice not best this kind tune , she treats tune well , without sort melodrama would easy . her little hum end nice , sweet touch . last tune cd , quot ; i want rockquot ; ( all things ) real swinger . excellent arrangement , it hard believe it dates form 1937 or ' 38 ; it more early ' 40s sound it . definitely product amazingly competent band . so scare up scott philharmonic ( figure out way play this cd through it ) , give little slides your sock garters tug , get ready turn foxtrot or two . if you want enjoy late ' 30s swing , this cd you . you may not able go back . but yes , that what 1938 really sounded like	1

celine marie claudette dion born charlamegne , quebec youngest 15 children . she singing since age 5 teenage star her native quebec before discovered musician david foster . she eventually landed deal sony records became instant sucess classic hit " where my heart beat now . " her other hit " if there any other way " also made top 40 proving american public could possibly love her much they quebec . even though this album releaed 1990 there most definately 80 pop sound it which some newer fans may not like . her voice sounds flawless throughout . some critics referred celine voice " technical marvel " i agree . she put emotion power into song unlike any other artist pop singer out there . i highly reccomend this anyone new celine music or open minded music lover . overall grade :	-1
this cd so weird it just awesome ! i love it , it addictive . it perfect combo people this band . i swear i read lead singer misfits this , but i'm not sure . i don't see or hear anything him it ... :( oh well , awesome cd	1
this one my all time favorite soundtracks listen . music calms me puts me good mood	1
i'm huge fan three songs this collection , but very disappointed much rest . i'm very familiar cale vu catalog , some this later work , but this mid-70s period largely mystery me . there no debating cale talent or passion his music , but there dozen tracks this compilation sound like b-sides just added their respective albums afterthought . " ski patrol " instance just awful song . said , " pablo picasso " , " heartbreak hotel " few others just brilliant performances	-1

" cambia la piel " 9.5 /10ricky sophomore english album ( sixth solo album overall ) picks up where " ricky martin 1999 " left off . thick , slick production aggressive beats work well ricky voice . songs like " amor " , " saint tropez " , " cambia la piel " " jezabel " where things gel together best he sounds assured . there few dull spots such " if you ever saw her " original version " nobody wants lonely . " it mystery why massive hit duet version christina aguliera wasn't included . it should included . luckily , he projects enough charisma make those moments listenable . aside , there enough good moments please most pop fans . other two ballads " come me " " touch " revel ricky more sensitive side quite pleasant . this album well suited fans dance-pop , latin-pop club/dance . this album would not appeal you if you don't like those styles	-1
swv ... i really don't know where start ! swv such good group i just think they don't get much recognition they should , but neither some other acts 90s scene . i think swv also one best female singers ( coco ) , i just think it sad how you see artist now like beyonce , ciara , destiny child , so get all this credit what they but it not half good swv . but remember good moments music i bought this album keep memories real music ! this album so good , but when i first bought it i just bought it here main songs i knew but then one day i decided listen whole album i amazed how great these songs still . if there one song i didn't really like i would say probably track #5 , i didn't skip any song besides one , but it still alright . i advise anyone who wants hear good music buy this album because you pleased . only thing i thought they should've put song " we " best cd , but they different hits cd song there . but besides everything this album great ! so if you don't want sit hear ciara other artist try sing , you should buy " best swv " . ( i would rate this album 10 if they let me !	1
lot quot;kid musicquot ; drives me crazy annoying voices poor quality music but this great collection my daughter i both enjoy . most songs sung same guy -- little more variety might nice but he pleasant voice sings old favorites well some new me . we've worn out our cassette now i'm shopping cd ..	1
fans clerks movie no doubt love soundtrack , which not only features music movie , but dialog excerpts movie tie into songs . alice chains ' quot ; got me wrongquot ; their quot ; sapquot ; ep fits randal perfectly , which probably why it included soundtrack begin . supernova quot ; chewbaccaquot ; hilarious ties into preceding dialog excerpt dante randal over what better ; empire strikes back return jedi . bad religion quot ; leaders followersquot ; fits dante persona ( film he said he couldn't make altering decisions himself ) , while surprise appearences stabbing westward corrosion conformity nicely add heavy flair package . soul asylum quot;can't even tellquot ; film theme song fits it nicely , not mention clerks dvd video kevin smith directed song included . all all , if you loved clerks movie , you'll dig soundtrack	1

alright , so conor oberst 27 years old now . i stop calling him kid then ? probably not . i don't mean slight him any way . i mean , kid ( see ) amazing . you your own record label when you 14 ? no , i didn't think so . i've listening " four winds " cd single everyday since it came out . just biding my time until new bright eyes album " cassadaga " fell into my hands yesterday . i've foaming mouth it . anyway , my thoughts " cassadaga " ? historically there 3 " types " bright eyes songs . 1)songs immediacy hit you right away hooks , melodies , lyrics charm that undeniable . 2)songs enduring power gifts only reveal themselves after listener " endured " several listens ( these best ones ) . 3)songs head-scratching befuddlement you may never appreciate no matter how many times you try find something redeeming it . there one these every bright eyes album it always cracks me up see everyone reach skip button same time . it usually first song wherein conor tries set mood irritating hell out you . " cassadaga " course all three types songs them . i expect lot ink expended suggesting more mature conor emerged here . rubbish ! kid writing pretty grown-up stuff when he 16 . besides men don't mature . best they just get more adept hiding failure their development . i guess most mature thing " cassadaga " conor become masterful applying his encyclopedic knowledge roots , country , blues his own unique vision . check out mandolin violin " four winds " tell me that not beautifully controlled chaos . janet weiss ( hammer sleater-kinney ) plays drums few tracks here but you wouldn't know it because it sounds exactly how conor arranged it sound . there kind pop bright eyes ' country almost mystical zeppelin quality it ( mythic feeling , not sound ) . cleansing rain wilco foggy foreboding . it entirely possible this may eventually become my favorite bright eyes record . songs all strong ( although " make plan love me " category 3 me ) . it obvious start you'll need spend some time courting this album , but far first date kisses go , this one pretty great . my girlfriend hates his voice . i don't get . how someone who loves johnny cash , willie nelson fail hear intensity oberst . blasphemous comparison ? i don't think so . i hear same passion conviction " if brakeman turns away " i " rock island line " or " funny how time slips away " . when conor sings it ... i buy it . especially when his lyrics so bloody brilliant ! my two favorite lines ( so far ) same song , " soul singer session band " ... " you mean nothing no one but nobody fault . " ... " i lengthy discussion power myth ... post-modern author who didn't exist ... this fictitious world all reality twists ... i hopeless romantic ... now i'm just turning tricks " seriously ... come !?! when anybody so deftly ( or otherwise ) worked bill moyers into rock ( or otherwise ) lyric ? album packed gifted verse sonic landscape worthy them . " cassadaga " promises endlessly rewarding experiance . it good thing too . i didn't last week new stooges !	-1
fifteen years owning this cd this recording never ceases amaze me . i watched miss saigon its grand broadway scale , not mention its ambitious helicopter scene , years back it set bar my theater standards . this recording recaptures aural experience this epic 2-cd compilation . tony award-winner lea salonga shines her youthful bell-like soprano , belts out pure emotion role ill-fated kim , quite possibly only she effectively essay . jonathan pryce perfect his feisty character engineer , his catchy tunes " if you wanna die bed " brings out humor otherwise melodramatic musical . simon bowman lends his powerful voice chris , but many annoyed his excessive vibrato . claire moore , playing ellen ( chris ' wife ) oddity ; she belts out all her songs indiscriminately refuses blend duets . peter polycarpou ( john ) renders moving piece " bui doi " performs excellent supporting role . keith burns ( thui ) plays kim spurned lover displays his wide vocal range confrontation scenes . over years i played this cd over diverse listening environments ; still , it pleasure revisiting musical launched thousand protests raked record-breaking advance ticket sales . though broadway production long gone , its energy catchy tunes still resonate every theater enthusiast	1

why this hasn't reviewed beyond me . what great this album it now over ten years old , hasn't dated or lost any relevance all . dark long nice creeping song , fits semi-seedy lyrics . mmm skyscraper much more upbeat bumps nicely . surfboy weird little song , almost instrumental , shows how well they still make songs even without trademark vocals . spoonman ( no relation soundgarden song ) grown me greatly over years , even shows them trying rap little . tongue mostly just vocals relaxing guitar . dirty epic great long song more subdued tone than others , fades into cowgirl . this reason i bought this album . i'd seen video mtv amp ( sort shame it went away so quickly ) never heard anything like it before . very energetic , showing how economy lyrics even more powerful than too many . river bass aonther laid-back track . m.e. hopeful feeling it , makes good ending track . while any album would make great intro underworld ( which great barometer how good band they ) , this their first , shows how they already fully formed	1

kinsella it again . here he crafted 8 beautiful gems . i wouldn't say this album really departure any previous owen albums however . he sticks same tried true songwriting skills always worked him , adds few various production techniques haven't his previous efforts , however , it works out beautifully . if you fan any his previous work , definatly pick up this one . standouts include : - bed abuse , excellent drums , possibly most infectious outro ever , guitar line stuck my head days . - lights out , great harmony you'd expect mike , simple yet effective lyrics , huge dynamic shifts- playing possum peed , i don't know why but this one my favorite songs ever .. i can't quite put my finger what it this song , but just listen you'll see . all all , great album , if you fan any his previous work , definatly pick up this one .	1

i've fan randy travis since his 1986 debut , storms life . while i still enjoy his secular albums , travis warm baritone perfect instrument gospel music , glory train ( his fifth gospel album six years ) arguably his best . key difference this album song selection , which includes number traditional spirituals no fewer than three songs sister rosetta tharpe . standout tracks include two songs blind boys alabama providing backround vocals : " swing down chariot " " up above my head ( i hear music air ) . " other highlights include " this train " ( backing vocals members cox family ) , " nobody knows , nobody cares " rollicking " you washed blood ? " slip this disc into your cd player every day sunday morning . gospel music never sounded so good . [ running time 62:46 ] highly recommende	1

if you read my review " hed kandi : swing city " , you probably lost your lunch overwhelming way i praised kandi releases since acquisition this great label mos . seriously , i even got compare them ones released mark doyle days . but after listened disco heaven 2006 , i hope this album just one little down what seems promising future not what we kandi lovers afreid . hey , don't misunderstand me , it not baaad album ( specially if you're new house music business ) , just i ( maybe many hk fans ) expected so much more , after listened twisted disco swing city , than this hybrid full commercial record . first , let start good things : cover girl notoriously improved since doyle took his gorgeous classic kandi girls him ; check disco kandi 05.05 ' front cover you'll see what i'm talking . now , some tracks vivid grabs you dance floor ... now , what bad things ? well , 1 . some tracks present dark sound ; very huge mistake since uplifting sound reason why we love this series what we expect , not " tracks they forgot " include twisted disco(obviouly they missed concept disco heaven ) , 2 . too much anthems !!!, songs we tired listen over over again , , what worse , bad remixes them . take these one example : fade solu music(track 1 , cd 2 ) ... jesus !!!! this one around since beach house 04.02 .. included mix 2006 , world series paris now this year disco heaven ?? come !!! take me away remix(track 7 , cd 2 ) , rise up ( track 6 , cd 1 ) , jealousy ( track 7 , cd 1 ) , say what you want ( track 10 , cd 1 ) ... even if many these songs other labels ' releases , they just can't pretend we only listen hed kandi , they ? ; nothing different , nothing fresh . course there new songs very good ones , but , like i said before , this not what i expected what supposed quality , original innovative label . not bad , but definitely not good .	-1
social distortions major label debut veritable greatest hits cd . nearly all their " radio hits " this album . ( story my life , ball chain , ring fire ) . mike ness continues transform band angry punk rock early days more country/rockabilly/50 rock sound made them last more than quarter century . only knock this album it bit top-heavy . everyone knows " hits " , but some other songs tend filler material . also , recording quality this album not some classic songs this cd justice not reach quality band later albums . still , this disc well worth money classics it contains . i highly recommend following songs ... -so far away-story my life-sick boys-ring fire-ball chai	-1
this album released 1999 . now , seven years later , this album not even matter . britney spears remembered not her musical talent but her inability parent child . great music lasts dozens years its complexity , innovation , creativity , ability transcend cultures generations . great music stirs something inside listener , matters person who created it . britney spears ridiculous product her record companies created none these things . it saddens me see number copies album such this sells originally . yet , great albums all times sell thousands copies years - decades , even - after their release . music like this , britney spears her peers , disappears into folds time . it not matter .	-1

if you don't this album , you need get this . buy it , don't download it . everyone needs support good hip hop like this . man , i first heard this end 2002 i captivated . beats little grimier than first ablum lp , but they still true hip hop sound , no club banger garbage 50 cent . rhymes clever these guys mesh so well together . rhymes great , whether love/friendship story thin line , battle lyrics one them , old school flavord lyrics day races . they great guests too . legends percee , big daddy kane shine day races . they both showed they still it . ju ju spits fire all glitz glam mc one them ( which thinking it pretty funny because beatnuts seem gearing towards direction . ) supriser , nelly furtado , pop superstar fits well song thin line . get this , this group same breath both old school mc day races , tribe called quest , wu tang , you get picture .	1
christopher cross ' second album " page " came out january 1983 after 3+ year gap this his self-titled debut . his debut masterpiece key album history soft rock adult contemporary music . this follow up , despite gap time , very much continuation same sound , so much so it basically sounds if it could recorded same sessions his debut . although there fuzzy-sounding synths " all right " " deal ' em again " , synths aren't really much more prominent here than they before . acoustic guitar spotlighted more regularly here , but general , sound previous album , its prominent piano electric piano smooth drum sound , fully carried over . his first album massive commercial success , massive artistic success well , so , it`s not surprising he continued use same style . first album , this produced michael omartian , apart one co-write ( " deal ' em again " ) , everything again written cross alone . michael mcdonald don henley both contribute vocals again , this time carl wilson art garfunkel both appear well . this album quickly go gold , but it wasn't even close blockbuster previous album . however , quality album indeed high . cross go extremely heavy romantic ballads here , but there no denying cross real knack them . " nature game " ; heart-wrenchingly tender " talking my sleep " ; yearning " long world " ; incredibly bittersweet ode murdered friend " think laura " each wonderfully melodic soothing ballads built upon cross ' acoustic guitar parts ; his gentle , sighing vocals ideal this material . contemplative , epic ballad " baby says no " also superb uplifting , neatly-arranged background vocals . " what am i supposed believe " duet cross karla bonoff , both great vocalists , track demonstrates how incredibly similar they sound each other vocally . however , song , well album closing " words wisdom " , though not without enjoyable tunefulness , both go overboard slip over into sappiness . he deliver couple upbeat , feel-good tunes --" deal `em again " infectiously catchy fun , although " all right " lyrically slight very sugary , you can't deny its catchiness . album-opening " no time talk " somewhat ballad-ish , but it bouncy fairly uptempo--it really great song ultra-catchy chorus features terrific harmony vocals mcdonald . overall , if you're big soft rock fan and/ or love his debut , this safe buy . ballad-heaviness might scare some away , but song-by-song basis , this really strong record . it not dramatic step down overall quality his debut , there lots terrific tracks easily live up debut high standard . ( p.s. default volume standard cd release this album unbelievably low , so ready crank volume knob .	-1

this review only packaging . packaging looks very nice , it 10 " size red velvet box , bit smaller than lp . big problem inside cds placed next each other ( two top , two bottom ) . result , chances they get dislodged during transport high : i got two copies it both cases , all four cds dislodged consequently scratched . difference this edition non-limited edition ( asin : b000f5gkp4 ) fourth disc unmixed songs . if this reason you plan buying this edition , you find most songs their unmixed full length versions either gu 10 ( unmixed ) version ( asin : b000gpi3bc ) or artists ' albums . i not recommend this item , rating 1 star based state which it unfortunately likely received , , damaged	-1

toto first original album 7 years turned out most refined solid toto effort since maybe tragic death jeff porcaro . it somewhat similar mindfield back 1999 but more finesse consistency . title track falling still contains blues flavor seen mindfield but it deeply penetrates our mind keeps echoing our mind soul . dying my feet relieves us trademark toto backing sound bridge part . bottom your soul became hit europe japan typical grace toto ballad . rock tracks such hooked taint your world give ballads comes after much brilliance no end sight strikes our mind well bobby kimball everlasting vocal appeal . album ends instrumental reeferman could nice spice current tours . verdict : one finest comeback efforts 80s giants . rating : 91 out 100recommended : wide range music fans well 80s pop fans .	1
yes this new direction solas . frankly , i like it . overall , it good album . most material strong ; not every track , but certainly there much admire . i think transforming dylan rock/shuffle quot ;d ignityquot ; into celtic-styled piece particularly brilliant . nick drake quot ; clothes sandquot ; favorite . but , imo upbeat second track alone worth price admission . i wholeheartedly recommend this album	-1
album first appears somewhat more eclectic than your average hootie album . after time listening it , disparate styles music , which cross full-on bouncy pop ( araby ) mellow classics ( hey hey what i ? ) country ( fine line ) golden oldies ( dream baby ) , seem somewhat helter skelter their scattering throughout this album . yet after while , album seems pick up flow almost begins make complete sense . sure , styling somewhat random , but musical quality tracks selected , including soulful live cut ( i hope i don't fall love you ) allows listener enjoy fullest range hootie distinctive easily identifiable sound . i am purchasing this album second time , since continuous play first copy left it so badly scratched i am forced purchase second copy make up unplayability first . i rate this album perhaps very best all hootie albums	-1

rob first solo album after leaving white zombie proves success . best songs would 3 leading singles , " living dead girl " , " dragula " , " superbeast " . album kind short , coming up only 38 minutes , but it awesome nonetheless . dark , sort creepy theme this cd really cool . if you're looking some good " horror rock " , check this album out	-1

it not often you find band that willing experiment several different music styles same album . virgin black sombre romantic features songs black metal style ( quot ;d rink midnight hymnquot ;) , darkwave ( quot ; lamenting kissquot ;) , gothic ( quot ; museum iscariotquot ;) , opera/symphonic ( opening two songs ) , some other goodies thrown . rowan operatic vocals fantastic ; it nice find band trained male vocalist instead screamy 80 metal voice or overused black/death screaming amp ; growling , latter which becoming used all wrong places some bands . there very little black metal screaming this album , when it appear , it used effectively . songs , composed rowan guitarist samantha escarbe , constantly changing never get boring . lyrics show some religious themes , but not try force anything down people throats . it lyrically superb product overall . compositions very solid , although no two songs sound alike , there little disparity quality musicianship . highly recommended fans anything tristania burzum	1
one biggest problems i bread not their music , but my friends who liked jethro tull , black sabbath . alice cooper others various " more serious " rock genres , i , made fun me any time i mentioned bread . well , fact remains i like bread continue like bread time time . david gates great voice maudlin music he sings . song i think most " diary " , poignant song fear all us young males girl we love loves someone else . david gates just rips your heart out his soft mellow words he reveals writings diary his girlfriend weren't fact himself , but guy . talk gut-wrencher . but course gut-wrenching emotion doesn't stop there . here guy singing himself all us our dreams girls women we love . " lost without your love " , " sweet surrender " , " aubrey " , " it don't matter me " , " make it you " , " everything i own " , more ... david gates just refuses let you anything other than morose relationships . but somehow doesn't matter . it seems like there times when i just can't get enough david gates pouring out his heart , making me feel he i one when it comes how women tear our hearts out . but that okay , because it feels good hear it david songs . okay , i admit maybe you little self-destructive listening this music . however , it little cathartic too listen what you feel out loud . just don't listen this music while you drinking lot , you might feel too maudlin your own good . other hand , if it makes you go sing bread song outside window your girlfriend house , or apartment , maybe it good thing . i am unsure why " professional " reviewer would so negative this music . i am unable think anyone music consistently achieved style david gates bread achieved their music . this music " great ? " perhaps not , but who cares ? i like it because it strikes sympathetic chord me , professional reviewers need remember their opinion just , opinion ; one we ignore because we know our romantic heart he wrong . this cd great stuff small doses . well performed mellow soft rock , very romantic . perfect right mood . i wish they still made music like this .	1

goodthere not much say this release really . most part springfield stays true original arrangements songs , albeit different guitar or piano tone here there . songs i recognize , " i'm not love , " " life northern town , " " broken wings , " " baker street , " " waiting girl like you , " " no , " " imagine , " they sound just like originals versions , except their sung rick springfield . all tracks chosen mellow flow nicely together . rick great voice , but doesn't really challenge himself . badit doesn't really make sense include new song ( " cry " ) covers album , but least it fits rest . i would liked heard couple slightly different versions or arrangements . verdicti know i've little critical this album , but overall i like it . they're songs i know , artist i enjoy . best thing rick springfield staying true originals there no room mess them up , which happens sometimes covers albums .	-1
this kalmah fourth album , entitled black waltz . album cover positively ugly ! despite terrible artwork , album very good . perhaps most notable change music vocals . instead usual higher pitched screams ( used black metal ) , we much lower death growls . i actually like these vocals more , although they rather incoherent times . album melodic death metal , thrash parts thrown . keyboards provide grandiose symphonic sound . song lengths range 4 minutes 5 half minutes . ( exception svieri doroga , which minute long ) . comparisons children bodom ridiculous , because bodom more power/melodic death , whereas this much heavier ( less `cheesy ' ) melodic death . keyboard act more instrument , accompanies guitar solos . per usual , twin gothenburg guitars present : one doing lead/solos other rhythm guitar . defeat strong opener eerie symphonic parts mixed bombtastic double bass drumming guitar-keyboard solo . ( good band comparison would wintersun ( minus clean vocals ) , wintersun mixes load genres together , lot keyboard work . ) black metallic side sounds little bit like bodom , but it heavier . time takes us all begins powerful drumming , orchestral keyboard work catchy guitar riffs . gallows mixes minor/diminished chords verse major/minor chords powerful bass work . keyboards not featured much , leaving more raw sound . svieri doroga acoustic/drum interlude . black waltz slower song ( well slow compared first four pounding tracks ) , long drawn out death growls . around 2.50 mark slow string/drum part played , followed beautiful solo . terminal intensity very reminiscent dark tranquillity song , vocals all . there barrage drumming keyboards . it also quite cool thrash-like solo . man king fast frenzy instruments . i love chorus this song . keyboards play rather horror-like melody , empowering chorus . 2.08 mark drums pound out intense rhythm all instruments come together highlight song . groan wind little slower , delightful almost folk-like tune played guitars . it epic , highly melodic song . mindrust heavier song , best solo album . 2.51 there rather distorted , heavy section . one stands catchy bass-drum introduction followed twin guitars . although it last song , it my favourite . this song also quite dark tranquillity like . i'd give this 4.5 because some songs sound too similar . nevertheless musicianship excellent guitar work top form . i recommend this melodic death metal fans , or anyone who likes metal doesn't mind death vocals .	1
i purchased this soren hermansson cd eight months ago , i am completely amazed his wonderful , musical playing . this cd very special several reasons . first , we get hear little-known scandinavian horn player give swedish works other obscure works horn . soren hermansson plays bright , beautiful tone appropriate bringing his sound forefront orchestra . also , we get very rare recording gordon jacob fine horn concerto . furthermore , this cd gives balanced perspective horn players offering different tonal playing concep t.t he jacob horn concerto opens piece . hermansson very rhythmically precise his playing . he full command horn , he plays beauty accuracy . hermansson plays brain-like ease . cadenza first movement beautiful . concerto slow movement beautiful , transcendent , mournful autumnal . hermansson plays very emotionally , result very gripping . he sustains long lines gives good forward motion . last movement jacob horn concerto really cooks ! quarter note equals 132 , hermansson single-tongues it perfectly , no easy feat ! he negotiates very , very difficult acrobatics seeming ease . matyas seiber wrote " nocturno horn strings , " dedicated dennis brain . it difficult piece get into . it almost uncompromising its musical language seiber compatriot , bela bartok . i like bartok-like musical ideas presented . this work very difficult musically emotionally , i not really worked much this piece , myself . hermansson plays great dedication musicality . lars-erik larsson wrote set twelve concertinos solo instruments , hermansson includes one horn orchestra here . opening movement full swedish melodies longing northland . one hear influence carl nielsen , one my favorite composers . there good variety lyrical playing declamatory power , also . second movement strange , detached eerie . hermansson orchestra excellent job giving it air mystery . finale fast , epic , rhythmic jaunt . it requires bounciness , lightness , quick fingerwork . also , there sections which call great power stamina , much like finales strauss horn concertos . max reger " scherzino horn string orchestra " very brief work . it entertaining curiosity , i could not order sheet music because it out print . it small , salon-like piece , there not lot emotional substance it . it nice , though . my favorite work cd , kurt atterberg horn concerto , amazing work . it uses lots colorful orchestration , harmonic modulations , tension release . opening bold forward , almost like spanish bullfight . it very rhythmic , it requires dramatic presence . there plenty swedish idioms here , also . slow movement incredible . it jam-packed emotional lyricism , passion , interesting orchestral uses ( piano cascades up down keyboard regular intervals ) . hermansson incredibly lyrical expressive , even though movement goes too long . finale very much bouncy hunting tradition strauss horn concertos . there frequent modulations very fast , delicate passagework . atterberg horn concerto really awesome . overall , this cd rare treat . soren hermansson wonderful , skilled horn musician , he well accompanied edward tjiviel orchestra . these pieces not readily available elsewhere , you enjoy it . it well worth twenty dollars !	1
writing this 30th anniversary phil death ( 4/9/06 begs question relevancy . how real his perspectives ? how meaningful his observations ? what he singing then make any sense now ? i guess it all depends upon one own point view , but when looking back all he said where we've , one must suck breath gaze upon sully load through years beat us down today . if any relevancy negated through time , how it we gape wonder his lyrical splendor his seeing emperor hairless [ ... ] swinging through air side side ? perhaps idea fruitless protest persists his self-imposed demise , or perhpaps importance standing tall remains his struggle . any , or all situations one picks his/her path shimmys through aisles . no doubt , some special thoughts always remain his listenning . this album valid stream thoughts , timbered melodies , harrowing lyrics . there so many samples workplace , this just one many . however , it short term we continue question who he really , what he really , what we become . give liste	1

i hear lot music . fact , i rarely ever hear album twice because i so many listen consideration airplay . music i hear ranks awful excellent . " tales new west " falls squarely into " excellent " bin . outstanding songwriting coreys dennis kahler coupled buddy jewell warm effective vocals more-than-adequate instrumentation make very satisfactory listening experience . after listening 11 tracks only " downtown matinee " left , i said , " if this final song good one , this one those rare albums where every single song radio-worthy . " that exactly what it turned out . there only few country music albums come my mind when i think those without single bad cut - porter wagoner " thin man west plains " ; confederate railroad self-titled debut cd ; hugh moffatt " loving you " ; hank thompson " most all ; emmylou harris ' " pieces sky " ; " spectacular johnny horton " name few off top my head . " tales new west " now added list . upon listening this cd , one immediately struck creative lyrics . " i get bird " bring smile any mid-westerner like me who sense humor . i would like heard five or six more verses " downtown matinee " - just so all silver screen cowboys could mention . but song brings quite wave nostalgia it . one begins feel like he actually sitting front big screen while listening " pancho villa gold . " this storytelling its best . one who always believed #1 spot charts should determined more strength songwriter than singer , i'm always intrigued when great songwriters like coreys dennis kahler come out woodwork . we only hope it won't long before their work presented us again they receive commercial success they so deserve .	1
... i love this particular cd because i used live turkey i knew every song this album . lyrics sentuous thoughtful i admire his creativity . i say quot ; go tarkan ! quot ; take america rest world ! many ( not all we already see ) admire you love your music , i . i many others looking forward release your english cross-over album !	1
listenening this album reminds one who know better when it actually meant something labled " alternative " " indie " .. not label itself means anything , but fact it used represent aspect music meant dissect normality predictable , zombified sludge sucks life out people passes majority consummed goods our audio markets .. when bands like pavement their prime back 90 , it must felt really good part , opposed marketed indie-esqe bands continue amplify today .. what seperates stephen malkimus wannabe generation follow ? utmost respect his own creative process every track , fortunately he talent back it up .. what may pavements most solid album , singer-songwriter not waste any time trying get know you like you .. if you want get know him his band though , you entitled some first class warped lyrics first class defragmented pop songwriting .	-1
this real treasure . this album romantic you get . there not one second this album disappoints . i never grow weary listening it , especially night my girl my side . only thing disappointing fact it not very long album , however , besides small detail , you can't go wrong making this purchase regardless what kind music you enjoy listening . this one those absolute no-brainers ! if you don't own this , go out buy it right now , you won't regret it second . there no doubt it - johnny hartman greatest singer never became famous history man kind ! okay , so it bit stretch ... but after you listen this album you see why i throw out such lofty praise .	1

joe pass simply greatest guitarist ever . his bottomless improvisational techniques boggle mind offer ears something new each repeated listening any his songs . his ability modulate seamlessly fill his melodies harmonized chords walking bass lines take your breath away . pass lightning fast single-note chordal abilities used only when needed , keeping artistry each some song balance its complexity . this double-cd album consists fast slow songs all intensities . most acoustic pass playing alone without missing beat . guitarist point view , while general spoon-fed public continues idolize rather limited skills hendrix , vaughan all other ' novice guitarists ' compared this ultimate virtuoso , joe pass sits quietly jazz world skills so beyond comprehension , it would take more than couple lifetimes scrape his level . but true genius joe pass aside his technical mastery he made beautiful music through gorgeous ornamentation his lush jazz melodies	1

next ( 1977 . ) journey third album . their early days , journey nothing like steve perry-fronted band would rise fame late seventies early eighties . group formed initially neal schon gregg rollie , both whom came santana . although neal schon always group guitarist , gregg rollie only band first few albums , he only served lead vocalist first three albums ( althought he would sing occasional perry-era track later seventies . ) 1977 year tht saw release third journey album , final one feature gregg rollie lead vocalist . read my review next album . put it simply , if you liked first two journey albums ( which also gregg rollie singing ) , you're very much likely like third one line . this album , sound shifts slightly more commercial direction than previous two albums , but band still manages maintain hard space rock sound made their first two albums so great . i admit , this album step down journey look into future before it , making it weakest three albums feature gregg rollie lead vocals , but even weakest rollie album kills best steve perry album dead . start finish , rollie vocals absolutely incredible , neal schon beautifully demonstrates his role music industry guitar god - something he'd lose eighties band gradually sold out went totally commercial poppy . truly , next album end era . five stars rollie last stand . journey first three albums aren't readily available stores better-known perry-era albums , but when you find rollie-era albums stores , you'll notice they priced very low . all searching it takes find them if you're fan progressive heavy space rock - you'll more than satisfied end . next appropriate title journey last album rollie lead vocals , because time their next album came around , band would totally different one one rollie schon gave birth . steve perry would take band more commercial direction , rollie would strictly organist occasional vocalist , before his inevitable departure . first three journey albums depict real journey , before perry changed them . i strongly recommend buying them if you're classic rock fan	1

no one agrees exact definition punk , even if some consensus reached , word " punk " would still evoke images leather clad snotty young men hammering out 3 chord anthems . new wave considered many nothing more than danceable punk music boasting synthesizers pop melody . these reasons , i feel uncomfortable labeling remain light either punk or new wave album . i could say it alternative album , but alternative such broad vague term many fans alternative char t-t opping groups 90 would tilt their head furrow their brows puzzlement upon hearing said alternative masterwork remain light , i wouldn't blame them . this album doesn't " cool " other alternative touchstones such velvet underground nico , unknown pleasures or nevermind . fact , remain light times sounds downright nerdy . my utter worship perhaps even over romanticism this album not take root instantly . fact , when i first heard it , i laughed . this what inspired bands such radiohead ? this what most respected indie critics cite perfection alternative music ? it cannot , this simply bunch panicky inarticulate noise ! i right way , but i wrong way well . first seconds album , you must engage complete undivided attention music or else become instantaneously alienated . casual listening not option if you wish completely appreciate remain light . first , instruments all seem defiantly independent each other , unaware what any others doing . guitars sound almost nervous vocals front man david byrne , beat multifaceted waterlogged almost african-sounding polyrhythms , hardly danceable , least not right away . but reality , this apparently uneasy mess noise exact calculated one mozart symphonies . one complaint common among those who hear this album but don't truly listen its apparent lack hooks . this almost seems case , but closer you listen , more you realize every single song numerous hidden hooks . problem pop fans these hooks not out wide open . it takes many listens grasp musical feel purpose even one track . you aren't supposed get album like remain light . album like remain light designed get you . much album sound accredited participation ambience master brain eno . his production gave talking heads sound spacey , expansive ambient , but not drenched unnecessary reverb or delay effects less skilled producers used try mimic sound this record . but big i am fan not only eno production skills but his own compositions ; biggest contribution sound course due band . every song thousand things going once , first this cause it perceived messy unorganized . but i said before , these noises meticulously crafted . how so much going once , yet not conflict ? it seems comparable situation such da vinci spilling his paints looking down find mona lisa . remain light rarely , if ever , discussed concept album . this baffles me , because me it absolutely clear this album self-realization or lack it . shape-shifting recurring theme societal confusion . now famous single " once lifetime " deals aimlessness life , even among those who proclaim " made it " . one most terrifying tracks " listening wind " which empathizes man who finds himself committing act terrorism ( suicide bombing ? ) against " american man " last ditch effort preserve his culture . but david byrne lyrics something not meant analyzed or written , but heard interpreted listener . this principle actually applies whole album , why i shied away reviewing it past , i feel i still not it justice . remain light not everybody . usually when i like album i find complex wonderful remain light , i cannot help but consider myself somehow superior those who cannot appreciate it , snobbish it sounds most music fans guilty this one point or . but this album this not case . when somebody comes me says they cannot find any merit this alternative opus , i feel genuine pity . remain light indisputably one greatest albums rock history totally ahead its time ; but me , it influence essential status among other alternative masterpieces not near important its seemingly never ending well merit reveals more surprises intrinsic worth each careful listen . buy this album . if you don't like it , don't keep it shelf . give it somebody else who could end up appreciating it . plastic which this album burned should never go waste or forgotten among millions others . remain light album every rock fan should hear , whether they end up liking it or not unimportant . remain light twisted journey every music fan should required take	1

good reason hybrid hailed most forward thinking act club music . this true , but rarely i read any proper reflection what this actually means . back 80 music press used word `wagnerian ' describe high profile productions style trevor horn . bands like abc frankie goes hollywood certainly well-produced but end they nothing wagner . this certainly case hybrid music . it post-romantic classical music ( fex . strauss , mahler , wagner , schoenberg ) transposed club music . it similar kind velvety quality which comes extensive use over octave harmonies . how their third cd place itself into above framework ? expect their most uncommercial release . title " i choose noise " symptomatic sense , progression wa via m-scifi ever increasing presence stabs colours created different kinds sound effects . this record more than its predecessor points ahead . future sounds more pointillistic or even atonal , if ( like this record would suggest ) more more prominence given singular layers sound colours . get proper picture this , just compare ' snyper ' wa ' i choose noise ' ich . they both their core solid cornerstones tonal orchestration , but whereas first case whole piece almost if awaits orchestrated parts enter piece ( this sense gets it fulfilment their introduction ) , second tune refence tonal structures more allusive . piece fast unpredictable stream lava tonal structures seem float this colourful texture like vaporizing icebergs . cd one solid masterpiece degree , i would not single out any personal favourites . only thing i suggest listener pay attention similarity some chords `secret circles ' `just today ' . first one prelude whole record sounds some parts like variation coda end `jft ' , which i guess proves claim one solid piece work ...	1

arsis what happens intersection singer-songwriter mentality melodic death metal ; arsis , if you , fine wine melodic death metal . many enjoy their work , but there much room ' deeper ' appreciation their artistic efforts . rumor it guitarist james malone drummer michael van dyne products berklee school music , which would not surprise me given compositional maturity musical virtuosity these two players . i can't remember exactly when or where i first heard " celebration guilt , " but i recall experience itself . i completely blown away way arsis balanced level aggressiveness i haven't heard since slaughter soul symphonic sense melody layering . until you listen " celebration guilt " headphones you won't fully appreciate craftsmanship went into this album . while it not uncommon death metal act feature one guitarist ( see : decapitated or hate eternal ) , more melody-oriented groups generally rely two guitarists complete harmonies rhythm/lead sections . malone , however , it clear he neither needed nor wanted help . i count three guitar tracks most points album , again only noticeable headphones because how well layering composed . but i hinted above , what makes arsis real gem their composition skills . if you've read my other reviews you know i am huge stickler good songwriting . bands like darkane , decapitated , , course , my personal favorites , gates , true respect power well-written song . arsis continue this legacy , embracing not only killer riffs but solid song structures carry you through every minute music out missing beat . " celebration guilt " i , however , my complaints . recording very decent but could afford thicker sound . i said , there lot layering multitracking guitars , but overall thickness , meat production , could more present . while drummer van dyne plays consistency metronome , i find myself disagreeing some his fill work . this too i attribute partially albums production , which allows tom work slip into background , but also , i think , more punk thrash-oriented style which he performs ( , when he not blasting away ) . but this all trivial compared overall quality this album . it hailed many critics best 2004 , certainly deserves such accolades . my complaints but hot air next this magnificent work metal artistry .	1

' tales endurance ( parts 4 , 5 6 )' , ' st. petersburg ' ' low ' elevated moments this too-short album ( 9 songs bit rip-off , hence 4 stars ) sees musical development touched previous ' hollow little reign ' , ' moving ' ' prophet 15 ' . you'll excused thinking like i you're listening titivating rendition " abbey road " ... there no mistaking it ... it very beatleish but that ok because it works without tacky . it low point ' coffee pot " which sounds like it should herb alpert tijuana brass album but supergrass get away it becuase their music so diverse ... i just don't think many people like it . overall album good ; very good . now i just wait next one	-1

english our lady peace fan i not get see band often , i rely power their music cross pond reach out me , make me tap my feet , make me sing catchy cryptic lyrics like previous our lady peace albums . although many weren't , i completely satisfied . healthy paranoid times least 5 songs would make excellent singles : where you , world string , don't stop , angels/losing/sleep future blame us ? although very good album would 12 singles , other 7 songs all serve very different purpose ; power thought provocation . it would too much explain all possible theories each track however : picture , some powerful , thoughtful lines dealing loss someone either through death or relationship breakdown . wipe smile off your face catchy drumbeat slow guitar over top . " i'm not afraid , i'm gunna make you pay " reaveals angry nature song which carries theme revenge . it makes you wonder what raine singing . al genina ( leave light ) mentions raine visits his wife chantal war torn countries , it communicates gulf lifestyles type lives people 3rd world countries . " life different here , its not camoflauged gold " highlights raines accusations 3rd world doesn't get enough attention , joins hand hand cd booklet which indicates what happend world since they started recording . although sung mellow tone , raines voice ability communicate wider audience ; something olp trying since gravity 2002 . overall album more facinating peice music than something you rock out too . our lady peace not stuck crossroads some may assume , they still making powerful music , probing different ways climb ladder success ultimately their music universally recognised . this album certainly takes them up few further rungs ladder .	-1

truly great live albums rare hen teeth when scrutinised closely , but this 1981 live recording billy joel could very well greatest them all . why ? well , hardest task producing live album give it character it own , unique albums which it songs derived . it great challenge live album hold it own face better production studio , give it ' authenticity ' when so many live elements doctored later production . ' songs attic ' packs punch it studio sources cannot match . reasons this owing four elements : i ) joel producer phil ramone went joel ' undiscovered ' tracks - songs predated bj ascendency fame massive success ' stranger ' 1977 . eschewing last 5 years hits , ' songs attic ' album captured fresh definitive versions reasonably unheard tracks . most importantly , these genuinely great compositions deserved reassessed wake joel newfound fame . ii ) these first versions these songs feature joel live band . ramone knew joel band character passion belt out better versions these tracks than more insipid original studio recordings . it rare claim , but i say without any concessions these perfect live performances musicians ; particularly de vito pounding , atmospheric drumming richie cannata brilliant multi-instrumental work . there no better versions any these songs any other live or studio album . ' captain jack ' , ' miami 2017 ' ' i've loved these days ' send chills up your spine , there no filler this record . iii ) so often futzed live albums , ramone production work mixing here astonishingly perfect . he wouldn't better studio . fact , ramone taste overly-clean studio sound nicely tempered grit live environment . unwittingly , it might actually added dimension his production style . decision capture some tracks stadium setting others intimate club works superbly production motif . iv ) billy joel caught here absolute peak his powers , both singer instrumentalist . he completely ' touch ' meaning these songs passion so overt , it can't help but grab you . anyone intrigued what driven joel illustrious career should start this album . it where he tells all his old secrets . this album so utterly unique it almost deserves compared more his studio output than his other live albums . there no hits here ( excepting perhaps ' say goodbye hollywood ' ) but every track magnificent . if you want live version his hits , go fantastic new release ' 12 gardens ' ( 2006 ) . whilst terrific showcase joel hits , it not quite equal transcendent , perfect live experience 1981 ' songs attic ' which unlikely equalled any artist soon	1

his debut solo album , ' perpetual burn , ' jason becker combines unconventional musicality devastating technical prowess gives us one most original compelling all instrumental guitar recordings . it unusual such proficient electric guitarist so many unique musical ideas , but becker instinct bizarre , ear-twisting lines takes us into wondrous new territory where his instrumental dexterity serves him well . it clear he composed this music his brain , not his hands . such exotic melodies elaborate structures play out , his guitar seems , then , like method giving music voice , rather than crutch which he hobbles kicks half-heartedly ideas he cannot fully convict . there grand musical drama here , epic adventure so far beyond most guitar heroes i cannot understand why anyone compares them becker . he real thing , unabashed virtuoso who play anything he wants but chooses varied textures , atmospheres , funky harmonic combinations , notes carefully articulated vibrato bar , thrilling runs where he both throws down speed gauntlet something say doing so . nerdy , cerebral , totally original , this album lot offer . it natural companion your cacophony collection or marty friedman ' dragon kiss .

back 1976 , steve miller recorded batch songs enough fill two complete albums or make one double length album . he chose divide songs into two separate albums released consecutive years : " fly like eagle " 1976 " book dreams " 1977 . both volumes showcase his versatility talent producing variety styles , including his own twist originality many songs . seven tracks " book dreams " found his greatest hits album , which released following year . like it predecesor , this album begins instrumental . " threshold " features organ synthesizer rises falls pitch smoothly , sort like sound airplane taking off , landing , or flying overhead . this track leads directly into " jet airliner " , one popular chart hits found here . long guitar introduction bursts into strumming folk southern rock style reminiscent creedence clearwater revival . this song , guy going trip takes him away family friends , but he doubts his feelings leaving them asks plane not carry him too far away or too long . together , these first two tracks serve introduction album . other popular tracks represent variety styles here this artist . southern rock song hint ccr style " true fine love " , which young man decided it time settle down girl he truely loves , raise family her . southern rock track love song " stake " , guitar work similar eagles or joe walsh . there couple great instrumental sections middle end part . both these songs included greatest hits album . " winter time " folk/soft rock hit features folk guitar harmonica , accompaniment vocals instrumental section . this gentle song dwells features winter : brown leaves , winds , birds flying away summer . it begins ends sound wind . steve very creative production " swingtown " , which he plays instruments . this party song intro starts drums , which soon joined bass guitar , then organ comes next , then acoustic piano , finally strumming guitar . folk style vocals accompanied various instruments , song deals wanting fun after hard day work . instrumental begins middle continues end include variety organ reed " voices " take turns , finally wind marks end other instruments fade . other track steve unique style " jungle love " , rock ' roll number begins ends whistles squeaks probably mimic birds monkeys other creatures found jungle . this whimsical love song love girl out jungle features great instrumental sections electric guitar . this also one his popular hits radio also his greatest hits album . remaining five tracks may not seen among his super hits , but they still trademark steve miller their sound . might expected its title , " wish upon star " gentle lullaby folk soft rock style , featuring accompaniment organ synthesizer bass . theme " it doesn't matter where or who you when you wish upon star . let your dreams into your heart . " second instrumental " electro lux imbroglio " showcases organ fancy space sounds , high flute , electronic tinkle , church organ . this track leads into " sacrifice " , mellow composition longest piece this album . this song girl who not appreciate man she once , therefore sacrificed relationship , marked fancy organ accompaniment tinkling trills , well bass drums instrumental section . " my own space " , last vocal this album , begins wind sounds , later includes instrumental middle fancy organ guitar techniques . this reflective , folk-like song escaping problems worries heading off quiet place like seashore , where clouds pass overhead , he walks sand , picks up seashells , feels spirit life , " where i reach my destiny , i feel free , where i my own space " . this album ends third instrumental , " babes woods " . this novelty piece miller , variety musical instruments such strumming guitar , drums , tinkling triangle , flute sounds , bass . it if instruments themselves players , since there no vocals ; flute guitar seem focal point , while triangle , bass , drums background . this mellow performance marks quiet closing this album . together , this album preceding one , would produce nearly enough popular hits construct greatest hits album , which released following year ; well provide considerable material other greatest hits releases came later . steve seemed reach high point his recording career popularity 1976 1977 , remembered these songs , most part . no one else seems able quite mimic steve unique creativity producing these artistic masterpieces .	1

fawlty towers fans going recognize name i'm barcelona -- that what waiter manuel always says explain odd stuff : " i am barcelona ! " but their debut album " let me introduce my friends " nothing like spanish music . instead , this lovable , enormous swedish band sounds sort like cross architecture helsinki polyphonic spree -- sunny , twinkly , shimmery pop music . it opens emanuel lundgren drawling , " daaaaaaamn ! /oversleeping again/daaaaaaaaamn ! /i can't believe i it once again . " he then describes what he'll " make it time . " it mundane topic pop song , but it framed sparkling pop tune full catchy guitar , twinkly xylophone occasional bell chime . songs follow same mold -- lyrics confusion , chicken pox , broken hearts , stamp collecting , finding spot perfect treehouse . songs wrapped them just charming : folky pop , driving guitars , twee little sugarpuffs , shimmery bell-augmented pop , sprawling orchestral sound " olakola . " " let me introduce my friends " basically pop people who like bands slightly sugary sound , but pleasant melody well . " let me introduce my friends " basically all sunshine , spring grass childlike fun -- very charming . you can't really single out any band members , since there almost thirty them , but instrumentation nicely polished solidly played . songs wrapped unstoppable swirling riffs , banjo , solid percussion , sweeps wobbly and/or sputtering synth , rattling bells what sounds like xylophone . lundgren nice smooth voice , although times he sounds bit like he singing nursery rhyme . lyrics bit short simplistic , but they admittedly sum up childlike enthusiasm music ( " you know i can't believe i'm telling everyone i know/that every stamp my collection place we could go ! " ) . " let me introduce my friends " rather simple songwriting , but deliciously twee pop some solid , catchy tunes . nice , unpretentious fun	-1
just what you want sitting under tree : holiday classics set shrill disco backbeats apparently think they're progressive acid jazz downtempo chill . while there few enjoyable tracks here -- extra-spicy mudfish remix already-lively spanish carol " los peces en el rio " genuinely groovable , creative boot -- majority either occasionally-decent ' original ' tunes ( which 99.999% population means " not holiday music " ) or painfully bad electronic mixes your standard holiday standards ( such those bryan ogden , who not only gifts us two tracks under his own name but two more under inexplicable one-off pseudonyms " hot toddy " " nutcracker sweet " ) . also worth noting despite inapplicable album title , these tracks not remixes , but simply original arrangements best existing melodies . if you're looking genuine downtempo holiday chill , check out reindeer room i or ii ; if actual remixes more your flavour , christmas remixed help you get your holiday	-1

if this single containing just tracks 9-10 it would gotten 5 stars .... likewise if it only contained pitchfork early demos . however , new old tracks no business same disc . imo new songs superior most songs new album , could easily replaced some instrumentals covers we got instead . tracks 5-8 great examples lend some insight into evolution tracks tsl . most them use lyrics made their way into other songs their debut album . if anything , this release shows you how much clutch sound changed ( good or bad depending who you ask ) since their first release . it definitely worth getting just new songs alone -- if you don't own original pitchfork it no-braine	-1

import version this remix collection must-have blondie completists because it remixes some songs not here , well alternate mixes some these track , so track listing slightly different . tracks you find " beautiful " not here : 1 . union city blue ( diddy power passion edit ) 4 . heart glass ( diddy adorable illusion mix ) 5 . sunday girl ( hardly handbag mix ) 6 . call me ( debbie dallas ) 9 . hanging telephone ( nose bleed handbag mix ) if you also own all maxi cd singles released time , you'll few mixes beautiful release already , but it good place get those mixes if you missed out cd singles	-1

i'm camper fan way back -- i played " telephone free landslide victory " my college radio show 1985 . so i loved this record meta-nostalgic reasons -- every song " new roman times " seems informed relevant anything 2005 pitchfork hot 100 . now initial buzz ( i listened almost nothing else week ) worn off , record seem maybe bit under 5-star mark . i scanned best tracks -- " gum you like , " " rr uzbekistan , " " might makes right " -- into itunes enjoying them mp3 format . probably half songs here don't really stand up repeated listening . thing , all camper records like -- moments brilliant , edgy humor interspersed annoying instrumentals/easy jokes/slaps small-minded conservatism . i'm not sure why other reviewers disappointed this compared earlier records . perhaps they're just getting old	-1
this jazz its best . if you , like me , saving your money long time get this , let me tell you it worth it . this best jazz group ever , playing live its peak , great sound , great packaging extensive linear notes . only sad thing after listening this box set , maybe this pinnacle jazz ; i ofthen ask myself when listening these tracks scotch hand : jazz get any better this ?. this set sounds like it could recorded last night . these guys raised bar way too high . one essential box sets jazz my money , best miles box set	1

when anne-sophie mutter lambert orkis boston last fall , i attended concert featured some mozart violin sonatas these recordings . while i enjoyed immediacy live performance , i felt ms. mutter tended overwhelm mr. orkis both volume style . shame because piano parts mozart violin sonatas always least important violin parts . little disappointed , i , however , wowed during encores when suddenly balance appeared . ms. mutter quieter more restrained mr. orkis seemed less constrained . it magical . thus encouraged , i bought copy this cd set , both performers graciously autographed it . arriving home turning music , i stunned ! this much better music than i just heard , even during encores . i don't recall ever enjoying recording more than live concert same music same performers , but there no comparison this case . both ms. mutter mr. orkis soar enthusiastically . . . while also retreating tactfully touchingly where that appropriate . balance two performers almost perfect . some people criticize ms. mutter putting too much passion personal style into classical works . this case , there bit restraint delivering passion style takes mozart composer prior century transforms his music into rewarding emotional presence now . exuberance his genius seems flow both performers they provide modern ( but not too modern ) interpretation this exceptional music . i find myself listening new understanding these sonatas virtually every day . anne sophie-mutter fans , there no doubt this one her top five recordings . if you don't own it , you've missed treat .	1

i believe first three duran duran albums all essential albums any living person this planet , their debut , ' duran duran ' containing their finest style most romantic/bowiesque songs , like ' planet earth ' ' girls film ' . ' seven ragged tiger ' , no matter how great rest songs , made divine ' reflex ' alone , one greatest single songs ever . but then ' rio ' just simply their best album , most consistent surprising one . ' rio , ' hungry like wolf ' , ' save prayer ' ' hold back rain ' all new romantic classics beyond any doubt , great anything produced 1982 ( year visage ' anvil ' , adam ants ' ' friend or foe ' culture clubs ' kissing clever ' , example ) . but what so wonderful this album not much those songs , but they way all songs this record strong enough stand test time alone . coupled together they make one greatest most thrilling albums ever , only one 1982 rival aforementioned anvil ( which rises same qualities ) . all all new romantic classic , if there ever , , i've already said , it one those few new romantic albums , which able sound divine visage , one those very few new romantic albums , visage apart , don't lack consistency all really up there classic bowie doors	1
leftfield long since disbanded , but their sound still around . most their songs still fresh classy enough warrant re-sampling , re-using , re-appropriation . sasha digweed dug them out bin more than once , just before duo daley barnes parted ways , one their tunes ( " song life " ) used movie " tomb raider . " no wonder . this album may old , but even most modern house heads , it lot offer . leftfield ( once refered kirkland crystal method " best electronic band period " ) doesn't break new ground , per se , but they thumpin ' good time ground they're . consider " release pressure , " ethnic , jungle beat number high pipe whistles progressive , organic rhythms . consider " open up , " acid house track whipped into fantastic frenzy clear incriminating voice john lydon ( formerly sex pistols ) . consider " original , " deceptively sweet itchy song , half-trance/half-deep house , burning buzzing tracers synth pop shadows . " black flute " " space shanty " hard-hitting dance numbers , unapologetically grinding out thruster loops against ever-expanding , ever-accelerating energy . these songs don't just encourage dancing -- they almost force it . even when they're not trying tear walls down their infectious beats , leftfield displays kind virtuoso that hard find these days , least such consistent but versatile way . " melt " plays like deep swamp anthem , weaving toneless beats , muted trumpets , high electro-chords unsloughably melancholy ambience . " afro-left " takes tribally techno turn , checkerboarding artful silences robotic wheezes .

when i first heard this project , my thought " bad idea " . love belinda , but after all , she american learned french somewhat late life , usually means dreadful pronounciation . besides , i wanted pop album . then i got album . my worries pronounciation weren't all wrong , my toes curl times . but then again , belinda voice french marriage made heaven , so amazing poor pronounciation easily ignored . after hearing album once , i decided this completely right , pop album would not . after all , decade passed belinda release awaam she developed since then . but so her fans . must say " sous le ciel de paris " really charming ..	1
here perfect example how attitude changes entire listening experience . easily most bashed work manchester great back catalogue , called worst album 2000 several occasions , slated worthless pink floyd rip-off no standout tracks , standing shoulder represents career low point oasis -- this first true testament band not immortal , not beatles new age , but fact slipping title brit-rockers-in-chief . sigh . it album die-hard radiohead coldplay fans always refer when discussing oasis ' inferiority , blasting noel gallagher " never progressing song writer . " sigh again . i've never really figured out thunderous disapproval album , i ultimately enjoyed most songs . sotsog contain some garbage ? without doubt , but not nearly enough ruin entire experience , or throw oasis off their high horse most critics claim . here're some facts all listeners need aware : 1 ) `f****n ' bushes , ' `go let it out , ' gas panic!' three best songs oasis ' career . wasn't `go let it out ' #1 hit uk , going right alongside `yellow ' even surpassing `optimistic' ? 2 ) biggest problem sotsog occurs format , unusual psychedelic album such this . if there any real unending quandary here , it worst two songs album , `put your money where your mouth ' `little james ' fall numbers 4 5 respectively . these should either left out or positioned differently , perhaps further down line up while moving high qualities , perhaps `roll it over , ' up track listing . 3 ) album without doubt step up here now , which contains five fillers/b-sides whereas sotsog no more than two . 4 ) giants easy listening . oasis flirts easy listening genre several junctures , most notably `wonderwall ' `cast no shadow ' , but usually sticks anthemic indie sometimes hard rock . i believe this album rejected quality oasis many fans due lack guitars overwhelming presence synthesizers . it doesn't always work -- ` put your money where your mouth ' example -- but it definitely different . not only should it respected appreciated fans , but it should praised its boldness . 5 ) although inaccessible times , sotsog flows unlike any other oasis album . this way , it tops both definitely maybe morning glory ? -- daring yet factual assessment . if nothing else , album worth it `f****n ' bushes , ' `go let it out , ' gas panic!' . but underneath surface , it much more than just singles album like predecessor here now ; it flowing , intelligent collection songs tarnished attitude dismissive fans .	-1

" blue valentine " tendency dismissed so called " transitional " album , it sandwiched into period waits ' critically acclaimed early albums his mid-career foray into unique instrumentation free form music his " rain dogs " period . my opinion when waits ' career viewed whole , every one his albums could classified " transitional " works , because man constantly moving forward his music moving into new territory each record he puts out . said , " blue valentine " great underrated album . my opinion title track one most desperate songs waits ever recorded , spare instrumentation waits ' gravelly voice perfectly captures mood paranoia he sings . lyrics song " blue valentines " one best examples waits ' talent songwriter , he describes man who abandoned his lover tracked down her continues receive her letters . lines " it feels like theres warrant out my arrest , you've got me checkin my rearview mirror , i'm always run , thats why i changed my name , i didn't think you'd ever find me here " , his descriptions blind broken heart nights full whiskey true genius . song remained one my favorites his over years . i also think waits ' voice it best this album " heartattack vine " . grit rasp his pipes these two albums unbelievable . other thing " blue valentine " stands out me " $29.00 " , straight up slow blues jam goes little over eight minutes . hear waits use his voice pure blues setting rare , he spits out lyrics his acid growl way would make howlin ' wolf blush . all instrumental solos song tight , i find myself continuing play song again again . " wrong side road " " whistlin ' past graveyard " two others where his voice unbelievable . classic " christmas card hooker minneapolis " waits ' tales down out individuals , jazzy piano accompaniment . i also think " kentucky avenue " one waits ' best ballads , always gives tug my heartstrings when i hear it . me , only turnoff this album waits ' rendition " somewhere " west side story . while it definitely interesting choice him far cover tunes concerned , it just never grabbed me , although i wouldn't say it bad . while critics may say waits didn't break any new ground this album lyrically or musically , i think they missed boat . this solid album , waits melded blues , jazz , symphonic music onto one disc somehow managed tie it all together way makes sense . while this may not fall into category essential tom waits , this good music . i can't make it any simpler than	-1

personally , i think this disc much stronger release than self-titled debut . can't get enuff ( 5/5)- groovy mellow rocker , great opener . loosen up ( 5/5)- sweet guitarwork reb this one , i love this song . miles away ( 5/5)- i don't listen ballads , but if i going , it would this one ... definitely one best era . easy come easy go ( 5/5)- awesome song , same kind feel " can't get enuff " . rainbow rose ( 3/5)- i don't know what hell ' rainbow rose ' supposed mean , but i like this song . it ballad little bit harder edge . day we'll never see ( 5/5)- wait through long intro ! it worth it ! this one sleepers album lot people forget . sweet riff , great hard rockin ' song all around . under one condition ( 2/5)- decent ballad , it its moments . dirty little blonde ( 2/5)- lyrics this one little under par kip , decent musically , i usually skip this one . baptized fire ( 5+/5)- reb tears it up intro , damn ! song awesome , even kip little rap - sign things come ! you saint , i am sinner ( 4/5)- great rocker . heart young ( 5/5)- perfect closer this album , leaves you satisfied feeling good . kip , reb , rod put out amazing disc here . don't forget check out " pull "	1
return frog queen treasure since i first started listening it . i no doubt jeremy enigk would able come up goods second time , very much enthused anticipation arrival world waits upon my doorstep . return frog queen stripped-down departure sunny day real estate frenetic emotional keening later majestic orchestration . it showed side enigk , left its bare essentials , humble personal songwriter . album narrative seemed craft its own realm folklore themes images contained within songs ranging sweeping orchestration minimalist crooked-folk . world waits , rather than departure , seems more amalgam all best parts where enigk come . songs this cd could out takes fire theft , diary , rising tide , or return frog queen . i built up very high expectations this work , once again jeremy enigk earned his place among names i feel most represent creativity inspiration contemporary rock songwriting its finest . if you've ever liked anything jeremy enigk written , you owe yourself hear his latest . let hope he gives us before 2016	1

first off , this album truly amazing . not your typical nu metal cookie cutter stuff dominates airwaves these days . i say 100% good way . way this album starts amazing . it starts off industrial sounding intro track immediately throws you into their title track first single " silent protest " . when i first heard this song it became one those songs you throw repeat . you know , song you just can't get enough don't even notice it playing over over . it then throws you into third track " my time " . this track starts off very eary beautiful instrumental just gives you goosebumps . it almost if it calm before storm . this album it all . it mixes beautiful vocals some amazing emotionally filled aggression screams . vocals times " electric " feel them , such chorus " away " . guitars also bit everything such those awesome harmonics you would hear so frequently nonpoint " statement " album . i suggest this album anyone who sick same old numetal out there want something original emotion meaning it . must your collection	1

characteristically memorable remark , r.l. burnside once suggested " blues aint nothin ' but dance music . " considering fiery grooves guys like lightnin ' hopkins or little walter whipped into now then , statement not seem absurd it surface . but what burnside achieves " bothered mind " total inarguable confirmation : if blues anything more than dance music before burnside took torch it , it sure aint nothing more than now , that hardly bad thing . " bothered mind " sound skip james way beastie boys . " i what i want , " burnside spits " detroit boogie part 1 , " opening cacophony launches into electrified snarling take burnside trademark " look what my buddy . " man not kidding . unlike bo diddley blasphemous " this should not , " burnside eclectic brew funk , hip-hop , blues rock tasteful reinvention storied sound anyone could asked . even unfortunate presence kid rock - talentless poser who seems bent mooching off reputation every elder statesman business - cannot distract burnside energetic menacing vocal performance throughout set . this not attempt dressing up older artist sound make him seem hip younger audience . it startlingly successful ( refreshing ) experiment which burnside authenticity never compromised production . bold interpretations standards like " rollin ' tumblin '" or " goin ' away baby " possess addictiveness narcotic . when martin scorsesee blues film box-set came out , there lot talk blues music fading american consciousness , like some relic human expression . most disconcertingly , blues not seem connect younger audiences way rap , hip-hop or even rock . changes now , who better than r.l. burnside lead charge	1

after success mariah carey emotions , music box saw day light 1993 , venturing become mariah best selling album worldwide . music box spawned some mariah biggest hits ; without you , dreamlover hero while also providing mariah carey massive popularity within europe . upbeat bubbly dreamlover released introduce people music box , it landed mariah no . 1 position single chart america . song r'n'b sound it , perhaps indicating mariah already knew what direction she wanted her music steer towards . dreamlover one my favorite songs it this particularly song , which got me interested mariah music . power-ballad hero favorite among many , its uplifting lyrics tad corny childish my liling . yet i never big hero fan ; however it must somewhat impact it managed reach no . 1 america . anytime you need friend clearly one best offerings music box . its gospel-like features choir assisting mariah work perfectly together . title-track not all interesting . fact , many non-released songs blend forgettable . case mariah emotions album , music box also suffers weak ending album . songs such just hold you once again , i've thinking you , all i've ever wanted everything fades nice songs ; however i tend skip them . sure , they listenable - yet i cannot remember what they sound like until i actually hear them myself . now i know never forget you enjoyable songs . now i know distinguishes itself rest songs album . its fast pace contagious beat makes song welcoming offering . never forget you babyface production - just think madonna take bow , tlc red light special diggin you well toni braxton breathe again - which , my opinion , far superior songs never forget you . despite corny lyrics , slowly mid-tempo never forget you not all bad . i still enjoy listening it despite its flaws . without you probably mariah biggest hit europe , landing miss carey her first uk no . 1 . it powerful ballad , which surely displays mariah carey ability take cover version make it her own . i not consider music box among mariah carey best albums , yet it certainly not among her worst . singles definitely highlights album : dreamlover , hero , anytime you need friend without you . they reasons buying album . however , there too many dull average ballads . buy mariah carey greatest hits , if you newcomer her music . however , music box nice record among your other carey albums . overall rating : 7/10	-1

i 16 years old when this cd dropped , i didn't listen hip hop all time . i skateboarder , all i listened punk rock back then . i didn't really get slang , styles , or concepts hip hop ; i never really gave hip hop chance before this cd came out . however , i remember lot my friends telling me how nice wu , how excited they when this cd released . after seeing video " triumph " few times , i knew wu dope . i didn't realize it time , but " triumph " actually changed my whole perspective hip hop . this day , i believe this song best posse cut ever . inspectah dek method man jump start this song incredible back back verses , beat epic . i've heard this song hundreds times , but i still get amped whenever it playing . everyone spits good verse this song , energy track incredible .

leisure debut album blur , most important english rock band last 15 years . more creative than oasis ( hey , who isn't ? ) more innovative than radiohead ( beating them punch 1997 1999 ) , this album would seem landmark , right ? well , no . certainly weakest blur albums , this one still some great cuts , like she so high , there no other way , bad day , birthday , repetition . however , damon albarn yet discover his lyrical gift go his melodic genius . album whole quite listenable its entirety , but suffers simply too many producers . definitely worthwhile checking out , but their weakest , especially compared their later triumphs . if you live usa it worth getting uk version simply sing , american version i know ... get ' em both	-1
although i don't much classical music i appreciate occasional seranade . there certain times lend more listening this type music so maybe why they came up night-night title . it extremely relaxing if you not careful or too tired you might begin cutting some zzz . actually i find this perfect music reading before bedtime it stimulates just enough perk your attention but doesn't grab it take you away concentrating your book . although i'm not big classical music person some music sounds very familiar so maybe those know you might recognize some old wolfgang best or most well known works . after looking over liner notes credits it seems most these recording older but put together here theme . some recording date back far 1970 newest 1994 . i guess this classical music novice , sort compilation some his adagio , andannte larghetto . now if i only knew how differenciate these identifying terms ! it just sounds real soothing . price right people just dabble this type music occasionally not hard core serious classical music listeners . it part phillips classics releases includes whole line various major composers music set theme . example , they one mozart more lively entitled quot ; mozart morningquot ; . i guess anytime right time hearing some these symphonies . try it you just might like it	-1

people who say this last great queen album " liars " don't believe them kids . 1991 album innuendo one their best ever . " game " also solid album full fun pop tunes radio friendly . states game two songs went #1 , but i always felt this album should more top 40 hits . solid songs " need your lovin tonight " freddie mercury " play game " should bigger hits . gem ballad " save me " which written brian may . all all , solid queen album , maybe not level night opera or sheer heart attack but still great	1

i'm minority , but " like prayer " isn't top-to-bottom masterpiece suggested other reviewers . not say there isn't lot here like ... there ... some it ranks amongst her best recordings ever . shoot , " express yourself " one great singles ever , anyone . but there few things go wrong here . first off , first time , she takes her voice places she not ready yet . listen this , then " i'm breathless " , then " evita " then " ray light . " her voice , during certain passages " like prayer " , gets wobbly . there range notes she tries hold can't . it same octave she can't hold " promise try " . she shrill " spanish eyes . " second , some songs aren't knock-it-out-of-the-park pop classics we've come expect . but those relatively minor points . " like prayer " justifiably lauded pop anthem , but it stills pales comparison epic " express yourself . " this song sounded awesome first five-hundredth time you hear it . but " love song " ... mount rushmore meeting two decade ... nay , century ... music icons , prince madonna , results ho-hum , minimally melodic time waster . other hand , confessionals go , it hard expose yourself any more than " til death us part " . man , if this isn't sean penn ... then madonna way better actress than we ever expected . " promise try " weak " live tell . " nuff said . " cherish " magnificent pop achievement ... easy ears , simple fun ... video just plays your head forever . i love " dear jessie " . i think it cute . it almost kids ' song ... pink elephants lemonade , " la-la-la " background , calliope-like synthesizers . " oh father ' tease ; how autobiographical she getting here ? song , strictly speaking , it not much ... but it sure interesting listen armchair analyze . " keep it together " sounds like outtake first two madonna albums , that compliment . " spanish eyes ' kinda awful , " act contrition " added-on , edited-together sound collage . you'll never listen more than once , i guarantee . cd desperately need remaster . but sheer number songs unavailable her compilations , you're gonna need get this one too ..	-1
since so many people written reviews , let me just say various records aphex twin , this my all time favorite remix album . i love many types music but this gotham project best electronic music i heard . ( course , i might prefect varese but music long ago . ) evidentally i write more since amazon not want accept this review . let see , i could talk each track but many already or i could compare it suzuki or other remixes dorfmeister . i like suzuki lot but prefer these sessions . i don't know much kruder but could search .	1
i admit , i never saw " passion christ " nor i any desire other than i know story so why would i want see glorified violent version it big screen ? only reason i own copy film score film simply because i love music . when i saw trailers film couple years ago , music really stood out especially during crucifixion scene . john debney film score reminds me hans zimmer lisa gerrard work " gladiator " film bit dead dance middle eastern influences music . orchestral film score truly epic proportions . john debney certainly knows music play important key role movies . despite not seen film , titles tracks match songs themselves . i almost envision emotions characters particular scene song accompanies . regardless my personal feelings actual film , i absolutely love music " passion christ " .	1

i bought this album few months ago , i cannot stop listening it . call it beautiful or relaxing not justice it . it lush , moving , hypnotic , even funereal ( first ) . i've heard albums dead dance , lisa gerrard solo work , patrick cassidy children lil . none these nearly beautiful or appealing me . it true there uniformity album songs , but good thing my book , music flows effortlesly one piece next . those reviewers who hoping musical big top might better served listening pottery barn cd . personally , i hope lisa gerrard patrick cassidy make 6 more albums just like this one .	1

what said converge ? rather , what left said ? since they debuted 1994 , nobody able match this massachusetts ' quintet jaw-dropping intensity , scalding energy , raw urgency , innovative songwriting , godly musicianship , brain-scrambling technicality . so why should things any different now ? " no heroes , " their sixth record , flat-out amazing . although it recaptures much same intensity before , it no means tries rehash past glories . instead , this album takes everything great band before simultaneously expands their dynamic range adding ... get this ... texture even little harmony ! shocked ? i know i am ! that not say , however , vast majority " no heroes " isn't massive , brutally devastating trainwreck . fact , some it might converge most ferocious stuff date . frenetic , belligerent riffing , hammering , rapid-fire drums , rigid bass lines , rabid , atonal screams constantly run amuck , listener engulfed wave after wave furious , visceral aggression . converge musical abilities astounding , but it even more impressive they never sound like product studio perfection -- every song here brimming live energy genuine urgency . since it would take days cover all album meticulous details , nuances , nooks crannies , i'll limit myself describing only biggest highlights . crowbar-reminiscent " heartache , " which pounding beat , menacing feedback , doomy , earth-shaking riffs , strong set opener . later , " sacrifice " very caustic number guitar leads grumble like lawn mower engine , remarkably fast , driving blast beats , piercing , hellish shrieks ; " vengeance " propelled streamlined , smoke-inducing buzzsaw guitars deft , walloping drums ; title track explosive , ear-splitting , take-no-prisoners onslaught notable bass work . " grim heart/black rose " quite possibly best most infectious memorable epic converge ever written . slow acoustic strums beginning ethereal , frontman jacob bannon sweet , limpid , sometimes soaring vocals positively mindblowing . first two-thirds this song gentle restrained , wealth texture , sunny melody , unbelievable harmony , but electric power chords storm back onto scene around six minutes , they eventually erupt into full metallic fury near end . after such raging slabs chaotic dissonance 2004 " you fail me " 2001 " jane doe , " it seemed converge going last band earth consider experimenting semi-pleasant or agreeable sounds . but they , results stunning . even though math/noise/hardcore album touch melody wasn't totally unheard before now ( see dillinger escape plan " miss machine " norma jean " redeemer " proof ) , " no heroes " still sounds unique novel . but then again , this one smartest most inventive amazing bands last fifteen years , so we should probably never underestimate what they're capable . " no heroes " utterly brilliant , masterful , vigorous , engrossing thrill ride start finish . now question : how world they ever going top this one ?	1
