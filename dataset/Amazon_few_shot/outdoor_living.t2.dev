i bought one these summer 2005 . this unit runs way too hot use smoker ( easily 250-300 degrees ) . i even got replacement regulator mfctr , but both ran too hot . i've some success controlling temperature valve lp tank clamp gas hose , but only limited luck . i've tried using electric hot plate burner , but only worked warm weather barely got above 200 degrees . hate say it , but would recommend you invest your money elsewhere .	-1
i ordered this last fall 40th party it looks nice but after windy day piece top broke off after it all fell apart because it didnt any support broke top rail	1

this seemed like wonderful grill , but regulator ( which keeps gas leaking ) failed after month . unlike other grills , charbroil regulator purchased part full burner assembly ( over $100 , while other grill manufacturers sell just regulator tube , $20 ) . regulator not covered their warranty , either . customer support terrible , " communication " only coming through charbroil faq web . fortunately , there enough other charbroil owners similar problems who written web this problem . i never buy charbroil product again . this all so terribly disappointing , because i've wanted support good u.s. company -- but charbroil engineering customer support reminding me big three automakers 1980s .	-1

we bought this clock replace one those cheap quartz wall clocks our new ( used ) motorhome . i wanted it so i would not wear watch but would still dependable accurate time piece . it took couple nights before lacrosse atomic clock received signal synch up , but after it seems working exactly advertised , accurate right second . this clock large protrudance back where clock works reside so bezel not sit flush wall . either large hole needs cut wall or you just live it . no big deal , but it something difficult see photos internet . this why i gave it 4 out 5 stars	1

this very basic smoker . it well built . easy assemble w/ good instructions . not much information actual smoking process but internet full information . no information how adjust vent make it run cooler or hotter . not think it should matter w/ gas . it might just regulate amount smoke . i leave mine 1/2 open . runs hot smoker when set instructions recommended , gas valve 1.5 turns open . i mine less than 1/3 turn open achieve 225deg . it took some trial error figure out how get temp low but once you figure it out gas smoker works great . would 5 stars if knob smoker able adjust temp low enough . i keep mine pegged low	1

i owned this smoker 5 years now few insights those looking purchase this smoker . i smoked 7 turkeys , alot pork , some beef all really great results . i love its electric . regulating temp charcoal smokers tedious . you barely anything it except add water chips . it maintain ideal temperature 220 degrees fairly well , but there few issues this smoker : 1 . materials construction- metal thin lid fits loosely . lid suppose fit loosely ! there no vent so it helps smoke . but because metal thin , cold and/or windy days , it difficult it maintain it temp long smokes . often runs 200-210 degrees . this increase your cooking time ! hot days it run 230- 240 degrees . although i can't reccomend this modification help heat loss , i actually heard people fitting electric water heating blanket outside smoker help this . 2 . i wish heating element adjustable help regulate temp . 3 . door small which makes it hard add chips or water . although you take unit off its base add chips , this akward bit dangerous since you may spill water . it nice remove base help clean unit though . 4 . i installed after market temp . gauge lid . ( must)overall good entry level smoker super easy use . got mine w-mart $75 . anyhow , it great value under $100 . now after 5 years , it i need new smoker . i try upgrade although after looking around all electric smokers , i might just buy one these . i love " bullet " design vertical smokers . stainless steel version this model looks nice obviously made better material , but main section attacted base . i like able remove base . plus element still not adjustable . only other choice stainless steel meco smoker which better door design adjustable heating element , but double price . so i either get this model again some modifications ( temp gauge maybe adjustable element ) or get meco . hope this review helps .	1

65,000 btu -- loud , hot , powerful enough cook many french fries you cut -- all once , keep oil 375 degrees effortlessly . best fried fish you've ever , cooked 2 minutes . fried calamari 30 seconds . probably best $49.95 purchase you could make kitchen . ( okay , warning says use it outdoors , fire extinguisher handy . ) cook wok way it meant cook -- get peanut oil smoking 20 seconds . bit pain store , flame control rather crude , but man this thing one hot burner . burner ring reversible hold woks concave ring big flat pot ( deep-frying turkey ) other side	1
despite fact this clock hangs my basement rec room cincinnati , it no problem receiving time signal colorado . it should noted , though , , manual mentions , proximity powered-up tv or computer monitor interfere reception signal . owner some expensive acoustic guitars , i find hydrometer readout very useful monitoring room humidity . readout big enough easily visible across room . i only wish this thing looked little less purely utilitarian . big clunky , two-tone silver , it adds nothing my room aesthetically .	1
