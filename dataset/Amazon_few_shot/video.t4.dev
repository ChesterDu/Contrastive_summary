waste money . waste time . well-known cast . amateurish direction . plotless . politically correct point stupid . film incessant attempts humor fail . eric roberts ' character laughs-off his grave circumstance throughout most film . he self-important , godless emotionally false . it difficult empathize such unrealisitic character . best performances this film given gregory harrison lee grant . best scene gregory harrison eric roberts ' passionate farewell kiss . most authentic moment film : lee grant reaction her dying son carried off . very difficult watch through one-sitting because it so repetitive vapid . you wait wait something happen nothing ever until final moments . if you choose waste your time this film , you'll sorry you	-1
i unfortunate enough stumbled across this 2004 . i thinking it would good sit down watch type movie , but it really lackluster . acting wooden , script very lame , worst all , action isn't very exciting . i expected much better movie director richard donner . there battle scene , there action scenes , but they just aren't exciting . when action isn't exciting , you better good story . story here alright , but certainly not enough save movie . i don't hate any actors , they decent when they something work . here they nothing work , so they obviously didn't too well this time . this really isn't worth your time . i gave this thrift shop after i got it , i feel sorry person who bought it there	-1

case you're wondering , aforementioned ' suckers ' anybody who paid see this movie .. i dont mean just theater ... i count myself because it cost me $3.79 my video store ! looking back , i should given money homeless person , then went home stared wall while playing suspenseful music ! i would gotten same effect watching this pretentious piece garbage ! this guy sucks !! seriously , his talent level should place him writer sci-fi channel ... maybe he could write few decent outer limits or twilight zone episodes ??.. but he over his head when it comes big-budget movies ... where budget go ? price ' monster suits ' ( signs anyone ? ) increased multimillion dollar range ? my guess he pocketed half it other half went unwitting actors who agents suckered them into this sham film . if you read ' quotes trivia ' amazon link you find ( ) kirsten dunst bailed out this sinking ship ( good thinking girl ) ( ) sigourney weaver nightmares after she read script ... obviously she already committed .. spoiler .... short summary incredibly unfeasible plot : bunch people city who deaths family logical thing go live wildlife preserve ( although we see no animals it ) , undetected authorites , long enough raise children , whom they traumatize into never leaving village dressing monster suits other scary tricks . anyone ever seen scooby-doo episode ? then 1 guy stabs they send blind girl ( 2 guys we never saw before who wimp out immediately ) go get medicine through forbidden forest ( how she supposed acquire multiple-stab wound effective medicine up her ) .. but 1st guy she meets gets it her no problem helps her back over wall into park ! cult lives ... seriously .. thats plot . i've read he stole this plot book ' running out time ' ... not mention scooby-doo thing , or his camera style which he takes hitchcock ... this guy hack folks	-1

this isn't funny . it isn't well directed or scripted . perhaps it could great , if it decent scriptwriter or director , but it didn't , so it turned out mediocre best . unfortunately , i believed all hype this website bought copy this my boyfriend i watch . i told my boyfriend according most reviews i'd read , this going brilliant , hilarious cult classic . but now we've watched it , he i both know better . we know it dreadful , i only imagine all nice things i'm going him make up my expecting him sit through this tedious monstrosity . only highlight us spirited argument he i got into halfway through movie where we'd seen one actors movie before . i'm pleased say i won argument . pretty much only highlight movie me . my opinion this not ' hilarious cult classic ' others so often describe it . i don't know how drunk i'd agree assessment movie , or find it even little bit funny , but i suspect i would get smashed enough i'd need stomach pump afterwards . if you want see genuinly hilarious cult sci-fi classic , pick up copy flash gordon . great actors , great sets , wonderfully campy scripts , brilliant humour , soundtrack queen . furthermore , it stood test time still great today , unlike ' ice pirates ' , which dated really badly . better yet , get hold some ' red dwarf ' dvds ... seriously , red dwarf sci fi humour its best ! it so good , it spoil you other sci fi comedies	-1

comparing oceans 11 1960s remakes today like comparing vegas casinos yesteryear today . hippest casinos era , today highest standards casino elegance class ( no , i'm not talking excalibur ) , dull , smokey , hokey , cramped - just like original oceans 11 . i'm fascinated rat pack much anyone , but i think it important take rose colored glasses off when critiquing work these sometimes neurotically insecure deeply flawed individuals order judge movie its own merits . i think too many peoples ' sense self identity reflected image rat pack ever really objectivity justice . humor style evolve ( my father , example , finds no humor some most critically acclaimed shows tv today ) , so it hard compare two different eras . nevertheless , great , timeless cinema came out this era , but this work not category . any movie standards it drags heavily its " hipness " seems contrived forced into otherwise hokey vibe . musical interludes final stride down strip incredible reinforcing this image ( i love them stand alone moments ) , but jar so completely tone style rest movie i can't help but think this just vanity flick satiate appetites fans hungry devour media images highest style pizzaz era offer . regarding issue whether this movie appeals only older generation , it should noted those younger generation who reviewed this movie favorably teenagers . there may something deeper work here - adolscent ( or arrested adolesecent ) quest two-dimensional , this-is-what-cool mantra fans any age . me this movie little more than vain time capsule revealing how much tighter , interesting , more sophisticated not only most movies but perhaps society large become . said , there still audience old school casino which dank slot machines greet you door way cheap buffets , just there always audience smugly holds this 1960s ocean 11 superior . i know i'll take hit terms " this review helpful " points this crowd , but nature who they they got away lot would never compel objective viewer free folklore enmeshed this intriguing group fame .	-1

when you decide adapt classic film you should take warning several aspects : story aged ? how suspense concept altered new audiences ? we know professed sympathy cimino rourke . we saw him year dragon . somehow mickey doesn't look credible distorted mind criminal . he too rational cold represent hard character . illumination serious problem . whole drama looks extremely theatrical : anthony hopkins looks uncomfortable role mimi rogers inexpressive . elias koteas simply out context perhaps that why insipid dialogue . maybe david morse shows certain wild tendency . there rigidity dialogue . obviously you assist common places : internal disagreements policy procedure . lindsay cruise assertive this role . but initial sequence getaway terrific . it looks too artificial viewer ' adrenaline simply not emanated . sumptuous photography saves film collapse . music didn't help maintain suspense . it not easy readapt classic film fifties . something similar happened cape fear `s remake . question might around new approach suspense new technologies . bogart looked extremely old role rourke looked too elegant convincing ex con . good entertainment teenagers pop corn rainy weekend .	-1

anthony hopkins absolutely riveting adolf hitler . he captures all hitler mannerisms , quirks , facial expressions . my only complaint he doesn't use german accent . production poor , there some flaws story . example , albert speer made out almost hero film . it proven there actually no assassination attempt made speer . guy who plays joseph goebbels horrible , one worst acting jobs i've seen . but overall acting great , performance hopkins makes this movie worth owning	1
yes , this movie kind unrealistic but so what . just re-clear up bike thing . it wasn't coaster brake bike like you your old banana seat bike when you kid . it track bike fixed gear . which means pedals spin long rear wheel spins . backward pressure slows your speed but not completely stop i t.t hat why he always jumped off back grabed seat when he wanted stop quickly . also why anyone crazy enough ride track bike street usually front brake installed . look scenes where he freestyling his apartment . he pedaling backward . this only fixed gear . no coaster brake . if you look really closely some scenes you able see different bikes . like when bacon rides down stairs , you see bike he brakes . obviously stunt . but i really like this movie . i've messenger i always wanted place i worked like movie . we never went outside freestyle street while boom box played . hot girls never gave me their phone number . but we get see lawrence fishburne voodoo when still know larry . that worth 13 bucks right there	1

i think it kind poetic i ended up getting film adaption ray bradbury " fahrenheit 451 " . it because i couldn't find book anywhere ! i don't know how good it adaption , but i found film thought provoking , well directed clever . film set world where books banned burnt . nothing read , except numbers top bottles pills sedatives people this age often take . books contradicting ideas , book burning " firemen " claim . they make people unhappy sometimes , they change people . authors raised high world literature , if they more than people around them . happier society , where everyone equal , books must destroyed , they say . montag fireman , talented one due promotion . he wife , he large television set wall ( though most people this world two ) , he considers himself pretty happy guy . young woman approaches him monorail home , seen him around so long trip home she felt she should say hello . she asks his job , wonders if he ever read any books he burnt . it gets him thinking , he ends up reading copy david copperfield charles dickens due torched . like firemen say , it changes his life , suddenly this happy society seems little more sinister than before ... i think it film flows really well , couple nice directorial quirks , british 1960s feel it sets , landscapes colour schemes , which i always like . it kind strange it english film , since ray bradbury , author book american . ah well . there lot ideas toyed here , nature memory , knowledge , oral traditions , control . lot think . definitely worth look sci-fi fans , i think	1

" old chicago " blockbuster movie made 1937 , box office smash which contributed significantly emergence 20th century fox major studio . seeing roadshow version this film makes one wonder why fox bothered put shorter version dvd because you never view it again . all sudden , dramatic portions film make better sense , smooth continuity henry king directed film notably missing shorter version . all principals ' performances improve too because what seemed quite superficial now more depth . example , instead told don ameche honest lawyer , we see him action ; instead told tyrone power crook , we see him offering bribes . power , particular , very convincing charming irish rogue . story corny tale o'leary family hokey quality which undermined lot fox big productions . time you heard third time " we o'learys strange tribe " , you almost hope they suffer some unspeakable death when fire starts ! alice faye plays belle fawcett , dance hall attraction whom crooked power marries . this faye bid major stardom when she replaced jean harlow who died just before production began . faye diffident first but her confidence grows film great success her . her version " carry me back ol ' virginny " memorable . alice brady won best supporting actress oscar her role mrs o'leary but there nothing warrant it except good irish brogue fact she playing serious part once instead screwball mothers which she typecas t.t he special effects which make up last 20 minutes film spectacular really give film status it retained . dvd package contains couple short newsreels biography program don ameche but it would benefited commentary such important film .	1

this traditional telling life jesus , before his birth resurrection . cinematography breathtaking , color , costuming , writing aided carl sandberg flawless inspired scene jesus weeping then raising lazarus dead awe inspiring . it this scene which motivated me write this review . rather than showing us thunderous awakening dead within tomb , stevens jesus lift hem his toga make difficult climb up rocky bluff , puffing all way tomb top hill . once there , jesus strikes pose made popular style ivan mestrovic french bronze sculptors mid twentieth century . when jesus reaches high tomb , stevens sandberg compose masterpiece prayer god life before jesus calls out , " lazarus ! come forth ! " but striking juxtaposition , stevens pulls back camera , hundreds feet tomb showing jesus , son almighty , mere speck against infinity countryside , let alone universe , much fist fight charlton heston gregory peck big country , shows scale man god work . however , jesus calls-out lazarus instead seeing him rise , we see wonderment , bewilderment , fear love men prospect one man raising abyss . we see crowd , camera dollies , rolls scans , faces believers , unbelievers , doubters ever faithful , their reactions man dead three days , reawakened act god , brought forth human , favored god . how much more effective this direction ? rather than straw man seeing dead rise , we see instead how people like us would react such thing , awe , tears joy , fear , love , attempts reconcile reality , unbelievable . there no better way show spectacle scene alone must-see aspiring artist or film director . my only complaint film nitpicky one , jesus ' ( max von sydow ) hair too short . if you believe , clap your hands , even if you don't , its worth 199 minutes your time . i saw film friends when it came out 1965 own vhs dvd , watched it group , one which self-proclaimed atheist-he tears his eyes lazarus scene . 4.75 star	1

" all family " certainly ground-breaking tv show , episodes selected this vhs video give you pretty good idea why true . archie bunker , all his bigoted splendor , comes life right away premiere episode series , entitled " meet bunkers " ( first aired january 1971 ) . addition first episode , this tape also gives us season-one program ( episode # 8 ) , " lionel moves into neighborhood " , show season two , " flashback : mike meets archie " ( which 18th episode series ) . this 1998-produced color video columbia tri-star home video presented ( some odd reason i've yet fathom ) " ep " ( extended play ) mode . ( well , least copy i received ep mode ; perhaps some other copies * * recorded sp ; i cannot sure this . ) but this ep recording makes no sense me all , since all 70 minutes could easily fit tape spool " sp " ( standard ) playback mode , give better quality boot . it also seems strange columbia produced some tapes this series 10 " all family " videos sp mode , while others ( like this one ) recorded inferior ep speed . most curious indeed . but , even so , video audio look sound pretty good here , considering limitations vhs format . fact , hi-fi mono sound this tape actually sounds * better * than audio any multiple aitf boxed sets dvd . dvd audio tracks seem tad " weak " me . completists beware ! --- these columbia/tri-star videos " aitf " not showing complete , uncut episodes . some large chunks programming edited out this video , others this series too . which , again , seems strange , because there no commercial interruptions here , obviously no need trim anything time reasons . but , obviously , columbia used truncated , syndicated prints these " all family " videos . example missing scenes --- first episode this tape , final 2 3 minutes epilog scene missing ( when archie mike/meathead talking greeting card edith received earlier episode ) . it * * , indeed , all just " filler " , without much substance , but it would still nice see shows uncut . if you desire see complete , unedited shows , you'll purchase seasonal boxed sets " all family " dvd . dvds present shows uncut form , which great see , because there some often-excised scenes shown dvds you've probably never seen before , due chopped-up prints shown commercial tv . smile-inducing dialogue courtesy mr. archie bunker " meet bunkers " .................. archie ( talking daughter gloria ): " pull skirt down ! ...... every time you sit down one them things , mystery over !

i really liked this film . before michael moore became liberal celebrity , he completely obscure magazine writer filmmaker . this film major underground hit time , it still excellent today . you really feel people who lose their jobs , you're infuriated callous indifference roger smith management general motors . i really liked segment where flint tries reinvent itself tourist mecca midwest . it consisted horribly misguided attempt opening up hilton downtown flint , opening up theme park called auto world . it justs smacks desperation stupidity ; it make you laugh grimace same time . instead giving these people really good jobs again , they come up this idiotic scheme , which ended up disaster ( both hilton auto world closed within year ) . moore recent years become " political celebrity " , politics become quite cottage industry america . it not just moore doing it ; right wingers like hannity coulter doing it too . they all got books ; some them got films ; some them radio shows . lot them aren't really interested changing anything , it might interfere their livelihoods . i don't know if moore like or not . but this still potent , darkly funny film real class warfare , dismantling working class america .	1

federico fellini 1972 film not his best , when he 8 1/2 , la strada la dolce vita his credit . while many critics adore this film its absurdity plotless , dreamy structure , i found it boring phantasmagorical . it simply fellini version rome not rome , eternal city itself . risk sounding negative , i shall admit there some moments which it most expressive early 1970 rome - scenes which hippies american tourists invade city , long scene outdoor restaurant where everyone talking their heads off ( though saying some pretty vulgar things ) my favorite scene- underground archaelogical excavation which frescoes old roman patricians fade into oblivion . but mostly this film weak it bored me because there no plot . it starts off alright , movie works well when there no sudden fantasy sequences . fellini himself this movie , well gore vidal . fellini envisions himself young man studying rome his youth strict catholic school ( slide/projector shows ancient monuments like colliseum , apian way , trevi fountain vatican well offensive pornographic image woman behind ) later young man journeys rome itself takes residence large family crowded apartment slum . then young man sees talent show tasteless , vulgar long-winded . i found myself just unimpressed outraged audicences went far throw dead cat stage ! it bothered me there much attention prostitution , brothels or cheap , slutty women . cover film promiscuous woman start film . film rome italy , there hardly any allusion opera or any true classical theater . pope fashion show ludicrous blasphemous . only serious , hardcore fans fellini want own this dvd . it perfect follow-up his equally absurd sexually radical satyricon , loosely based old roman epic .	1

" oh well . 5.1 mix great - full life , well-deployed bass great motion spatial placement . these important characteristics this movie , you'll hearing plenty cars zoom across screen , helicopters hovering behind you , so . i'm little surprised there isn't dts track or anything really fancy this disc though - given director cut nature release , i expected top shelf audio treatment . while this certainly good , its hard imagine its best . director cut : apparently this version film includes " never before seen footage cut into movie . " its not disclosed where this footage film , however , or how much it there , so its hard say if it material impact or not . i saw original years ago , didn't notice any major deviations version this , so i'm not feeling lot excitement this " feature . " jerry bruckheimer filmo- bio-graphy : one little known fact judge his picture included this disc , jerry . fact very close relative chuck norris , if not actually chuck norris himself . other than revelation , this feature pretty uninspired - lots ho-hum text scroll through . conversations jerry . : this feature much more substance than prior one , even though its fundamentally unrelated gone 60 seconds . his conversations , bruckheimer explains role producer , conception , funding , staffing ( finding director , instance ) , so . this some interesting material , bruckheimer comes across really humble guy who knows how lucky he working top knotch talent . action overload : here some filler you . montage action scenes movie , set some nameless soundtrack piece . underwhelming . big chase : this series several vignettes , dissecting big finale chase film , shelby mustang vs . 500 cop cars . this very , very good material - director sena various stunt crew explain piece piece how visual effects film put together . lots great knowledge absorb . various featurettes : 0 60 : this " ok " featurette , which centers mainly character development , writing , casting . worth watching , nice short . wild rides : believe it or not , nick cage his own stuntdriver movie . nicely ! stars move : series featurettes key characters their stories , narrated bruckheimer , writer scott rosenberg , actors . notwithstanding fact i no idea what different " director cut , " this great release . there some real quality extras there , good audio video , , well , all adds up quality	1

previous reviewer noted film basically platform expound george bernard shaw views munitions , war other issues day , rated it one star . i found shaw social views , brilliantly elucidated robert morley better acting performance than many us ever seen him , what make this great film ; whether you agree them or , like morley estranged screen daughter wendy hiller title role , disagree , dialogue fascinating ; acting morley , hiller , rex harrison , robert newton youthful deborah kerr , first-rate ; gritty london locales add greatly atmospheric ambience film . i hope powers-that-be favor us dvd version this great film soon	1

kurosawa adaptation king lear succeeds every way , so brilliantly : visuals , plot , score no equals either individually or taken whole . criterion excellent job reproducing vibrant colors movie , which essential . plot based king lear , but where it diverges it improvement - final scene no parallel king lear , my opinion most moving . unforgetable	1

movie : ***** dvd quality : ***** dvd extras : *** dramas _teenage gays coming out closet ! _ so plentiful , they sometimes run together my mind . " edge seventeen " exception statement because it genuinely exceptional movie every way . screenplay todd stephens sensitive true life , or rather , many people lives . it tells story eric ( chris stafford ) , young man growing up small town sandusky , ohio , who just beginning grapple his sexual orientation . what so refreshing script eric portrayed neither victim nor hero ; he simply kid cusp adulthood who trying find himself . eric sometimes selfish thoughtless ; other times sweet naive ; occasionally manipulative ; but generally good guy ... other words : completely human . holds true other characters movie , including eric parents who love him dearly but aren't quite sure what make his fast-changing moods appearance ; his female best friend ( tina holmes ) who harbors deeper feelings him ; his new gay " family " ( headed lea delaria ) who fiercely supportive , yet sometimes insensitive where he terms his coming out process . thankfully , stephens ' screenplay remains true itself right down final fadeout doesn't cop out trying wrap everything up into neat little package ; end movie , there definite sense these characters continue live , learn , make mistakes , thrive . ( sequel , anyone ? )the entire cast uniformly outstanding . chris stafford embodies eric all his complexity ; his performance never strikes false note . tina holmes amazing his confused female friend ; more than once her face vocal inflections reminded me extremely young meryl streep ( high compliment indeed ) . stephanie mcvay distinguishes herself eric baffled mother , andersen gabrych fine eric first same sex crush whose confident veneer covers troubled heart . perhaps best all comic lea delaria , who turns warm winning dramatic performance earth mother whose wisdom understanding always available eric , regardless how hard he sometimes pushes her away . strand dvd offers flawless letterboxed transfer featuring outstanding audio video . somewhat sparse extras limited theatrical trailers " edge seventeen " five other feature films designed appeal lgbt audiences . it would wonderful additional benefit cast crew biographies filmographies reasearch tool viewers who want explore others works filmmakers , but this small complaint . overall , this truly must-see film , one worthy repeat viewings .	1

spellbound offers intriguing thoughtful cinematic experience , which slightly disconnected , most people cannot even comprehend stress children national spelling bee experience . nonetheless , this review try muster description how it might feel one children national spelling bee washington . . what makes these children unique they not spelled one word wrong , some words jaw breaking or tongue twisters . initially , there approximately 9 million children almost every classroom throughout united states while now there only 249 left standing awaiting their word judge washington d.c. grand parents , parents , siblings , friends , teachers , rest community standing behind while children participate national spelling bee . child there , overwhelming pressure rests upon your shoulders , people you not even know put up signs , or tell you they wish you good luck . day after day you remain indoors studying dictionaries page page while pages thumbed unrecognizable jumbles wrinkled paper . day national spelling bee drawing nearer , you feel amount words you encountering continuously grow . countless hours studying you discovered you only scratched little tip iceberg . this feeds internal anxiety judges probably ask you word you never heard before . anxiety feed your wisdom regards vocabulary augmented additional best wishes , you slowly turn into lexicon junkie . some you not get same appreciation , others their community . maybe , positive reception diminished , academic success might not favored it accelerated programs some your peers spelling come . however , you share one thought all other competitors - you not like other 9 million students united states . you different , unique , most all you far greater memory intellect than most your peers your hometown or neighborhood . some observe you freak while others deem you genius . all you come different walks life different ethnic backgrounds . yet , when you arrive washington d.c. you feel home other competitors , they just like you . you all feel pressure while standing front microphone . some you tremble fear while others weep . you experience new level anxiety you never before thought possible while spelling out words letter letter . pause common among your peers before last letter , all you fear possible sound bell reminds you you spelled word wrong . if you not hear bell you feel awesome rush joy through your body , body defense mode relax while others might not lucky you their spelling . agony spelling continues until you won , or misspelled . nonetheless , after national spelling bee you feel relived not this again , if you eighth grade . however , if you grades below eighth grade you might this again next year , which means whole year further preparations next year so you once again experience rush fear trepidation through your body . there moment film where mother mentioned someone told her national spelling bee cruel form child abuse . this seems true degree , each child comes different homes different kind expectations . some children , it seems worse than others , some parents take exaggeratedly active roll their child performance while others too neglectful talent their child possesses . it would interesting see how eight children film follows turn out documentary would made 15 years now . this film attempt doing this interviewing pervious winners , but it not show emotional psychological impact spelling bee children . example , there one scene when child beginning mutter incoherently while hives breaking out around temples his head . spelling important some degree , however , society might stress importance spelling little too much while pushing our intelligent students 99th percentile limits	1

first time i saw this film when it came out 1986 , time i terribly disappointed . didn't like film all , thought it amateurish pretentious . but then i watched it recently dvd , realized it really good film - performances all really good , i liked seeing dc scenery , directing mike nichols wonderfully subtle . despite fact both nicholson streep sometimes overpowering , nicholson get bit hammy times this ( i still can't abide scene where he sings ) , i found both their performances deep nuanced . co-stars good too , added lot , i especially enjoy catherine o'hara portrayal gossip . carly simon singing really set tone well this movie , which definitely worth watching . if you don't like it first time , watch it again year or two , i'll bet you'll re-appraise it more positively	1

head honcho [ ... ] i watched well over 200 reality/political films give " why we fight " my highest recommendation . this needs shown prime time television ; if it it would prompt thunderous public outcry badly needed government military reforms . it covers facts many don't know united states , like our penchant endless involvement military actions over seas . film launching pad infamous eisenhower farewell speech which he warns america growing military industrial complex . then , unique compelling style it pinpoints famous people , places moments time candid footage revealing quotes ; it also delves into personal perspectives few ordinary citizens affected sept . 11 resulting occupation iraq . it visits key players government exposes what really drives war machine . it looks military contractors congress their incestuous relationship . it also reveals much too influential role so called think tanks play crafting our national policy . addition soundtrack features some great musical talen t.t he information presented this film something every american should know , but they don't know it most part because people who want those war wheels turning don't want people know what they're doing or why . it seems war minded even believe people not any need know . people beg differ . " why we fight " my personal top ten most important movies list which why it would great gift . informing people kind gift really worth giving .	1

this always favorite movie mine -- enchanting , visually stunning superb acting . but i say , i think digital remastering takes some enchantment away . least audio aspect . actor voices lost human richness -- esp women voices which sound higher pitched slightly annoying . even music sound effects sound little " off .

i really liked this dvd . hard it watch all painful memories it brings flooding back into forefront consciousness . callous cold hearted indifferent nastiness reagan administration those it considered lesser americans lay hospitals suffering dying . this dvd shows dr gallo shallow man vaccuous heart lacking anything remotely akin human compassion unless course camera rolling . film shows cdc headed political hacks who elevated collected arts administrative spin control , reckless indifference suffering \ death people it not like stonewalling stuff mythic legend . while dvd shows ugliest demons human heart laid bare whole world might see it also shares most humane tender moments early days before hiv / aids got those names . film showed how even one america darkest hours when true presidental leadership asleep switch , little people those deep inside government all they could protect public health living up highest standards onr called offer themselves service our nation . dvd simply told truth it left pretty much viewer make up his or her own mind what they think those times . there some moving facts end dvd all now quite dated . i guess thing caught me so totally off guard running tally showing numbers sick dying people earliest days epidemic . it so sad how reagan adminstration so viciously sat its hands doing nothing while so many died epidemic it might not stopped but it might slowed significantly it only acted same fortitude home it mustered beruit or libia . yes i dwell too much sickening aspects those times because just seeing it again after lived through it makes me mad . seeing this dvd just convinces me we real leader white house when aids hiv grid gay cancer first burst onto scene things might not so grim . but this dvd so much more than venom pain loss it also highlights human kind its best . there much love this dvd balanced grim realities day . back day i not say i front lines , because indeed i not . i think this movie must anyone collection its current price it not beat . course i brought copy might buy spare lend out teaching purposes . this dvd pretty accurate hiv history it should told	1

i agree all other reviews which discussed " ikiru " terms its message individual : live your life meaning purpose , take pleasure helping others , cherish nurture children . however , there one other aspect i'd like highlight : kurosawa thoughts individual society . commentary stephen prince makes clear , one main points behind kurosawa work head-on critique japanese society immediate post-war era . although this period laid foundation japan economic recovery , kurosawa not alone pointing out drive economic prosperity accomplished huge human spiritual cost . this idea also one prime motivators behind work other japanese artists humanists like hayao miyazaki ( " spirited away " , " princess mononoke " ) lunatic right exemplified mishima . kurosawa uses watanabe kenji foil expose hypocrisy selfishness society values materialism order above humanity mindfulness . one hand , most other reviewers pointed out , kurosawa condemns way bureaucratic small-mindedness government stifles any real concern well-being ordinary people . other , watanabe son daughter-in-law embody new age impatience its elders their inability see beyond their own concerns even when people around them clearly crisis . number people complained length second half movie , but ( prince commentary again makes clear ) , flashbacks important establish stronger sense watanabe co-workers characters both illustrate their gradual understanding meaning watanabe life but also highlight their inability really follow his example . kurosawa view society pretty cynical when you come right down it . even though many his works celebrations individual creativity spirit , he also forthright forces arrayed against it : small-mindedness , fear making mistakes , greed herd mentality . it no wonder he often accused " un-japanese " . one also see this thread kurosawa later movies including his period pieces such " seven samurai " " kagemusha " : both these films , ordinary folks high mighty also found wanting groups . while there may individuals principle , they not prevail end . but , kurosawa makes this point each his movies , efforts such individuals true definition nobility spirit , it this message which provides power behind all his works . this wonderful piece movie making . it humanism its most trenchant finest . you must see this film , it one best movies all time .	1

" el-hazard : magnificent world " anime very much " tenchi muyo ! " mold : romantic comedy/adventure which blank-slate protagonist makoto thrust into sci-fi scenario gets play hero while chased multiple women . though characters " el-hazard " aren't developed deeply " tenchi " crew show occasionally suffers awkward pacing , " el-hazard " charm all it own . mysterious antiheroine ifurita compelling , kids ' hard-drinking teacher fujisawa consistently funny . most impressively , " el-hazard " tells complete satisfying story , tying up its seeming plot holes ingenious last-episode twist . usually these types shows start strong , only end up limping through anticlimaxes false endings . even romantic tension unambiguously resolved ! dub also pretty darn good , though it tends get overly shouty , especially segments centering jinnai . can't guy ever just speak normal tone ? " el-hazard " hardly type show change your life , but if you like " tenchi " or other anime this vein , this box set probably good bet . ( set actually contains two separate shows : original " el-hazard " oav its 4-episode sequel " el-hazard 2 . " sequel inconsequential side story unfortunately doesn't really add any value . )	1

walt disney made five television shows davy crockett fess parker title role buddy ebsen his sidekick george russel . you now own all five these television shows two versions . this version presents all five television shows they first presented abc mid-1950s . there also two-movie version combines these five television shows into two movies . i personally prefer disney treasures version . this version also includes additional material may interesting fan series . gem additional material interview fess parker . television shows this set diverse style . first three television episodes " davy crockett - indian fighter , " " davy crockett goes congress , " " davy crockett alamo . " these television shows some basis historical fact , though many things portrayed these shows wrong . example , davy left rifle he called " betsy " back tennessee when he went texas . what amazing these television shows response americans . suddenly children everywhere sporting coonskin caps carrying replicas muzzle-loading rifles . it became unfashionable native american , very fashionable say " bar " instead bear . though davy not survive events alamo , davy popularity such walt disney brought davy back two additional television adventures , " davy crockett keelboat race " " davy crockett river pirates . " according walt disney , this second set adventures based stories created davy crockett , who become legend his own time . stories more humorous than first three , showed even larger-than-life version davy crockett than first three adventures . what most remarkable these television shows how well they hold up . story davy crockett timeless . davy attributes those form basis how americans see themselves . self-reliance , honesty , keeping your word , plain-spoken remain characteristics most americans value . viewer forgive several things we now regard politically incorrect , particularly first part first movie , where davy seems little regard native americans . however , later episodes davy clearly values his friendship native americans attempts honor commitments u.s. government made them . i allowed my children watch these movies when they very young . yes , there some violence these movies . however , davy george russel used violence only when there appeared no other reasonable way out . given era depicted these movies violent , i think movies directed produced well . these movies great way introduce your children era when american ethic honesty , hard work , trust formulated . davy crockett instrumental example we all follow , perhaps now more than ever . this movie must every family film library . enjoy !	1
sure , this movie classic . but it any good ? frankly , i found it tedious extreme . it certainly pleasant look . sets quite amazing , cinematography absolutely beautiful . story ( described detail many other reviews here ) potential both thriller thought-provoking essay ( ultimately it neither ) . acting top notch , all special effects . those us who cut our teeth using teletype machines always get kick out seeing them all their anachronistic glory . fact , all computer stuff believable era pleasantly nostalgic . but whole thing never rises its premise . its " thriller " aspect artificial not tied central plot line , entirely predictable moment our friend handed only key stop nuke ! resolution afterthought ( quick fix extreme ) , barely even mentioned two lines dialogue after artificial danger ( narrowly , whew ! ) averted . characters thin best , stock wors t.t his movie really slow survey what people early 70s thought technology would like mid 70s . yawn . ( i must laugh whole bell/paper bit . it means nothing plot , ultimate contrivance . ) if deadly virus actually came back space , there would certainly action many fronts , plenty interesting conflict go around . some people would try understand it , others would want only kill it . there some potentially interesting tension right there . some people would argue keep danger hidden public , others would want warn them . again , could good source tension . someone would surely suspected military wanted harness it biological weapon ( mentioned passing , but never developed ) , while others would try very hard prevent . more tension . i'm just saying this movie littered missed opportunities something more than collection boring experiments pointlessly slow-moving scenes which it actually contains . this movie poster child boring science fiction , it would not way . i haven't read book , but i bet it lot better . its core , this movie boring dud .	-1

logan run belongs class old school science fiction films which popular early mid-1970 , prior beginning star wars franchise . these films not rely non-stop action or dazzling special effects , but rather thoughtful , intelligent stories , intriguing " what if ? " scenarios , astute social commentary . they included sci fi classics such soylent green , omega man , andromeda strain , westworld , others . while shopping mall setting some special effects logan run pretty cheesy , it still interesting film its themes may even more relevant today botox era than they 70 . i heard they doing remake would like think it improve original . unfortunately , given recent history hollywood , it more likely they drain every last bit intelligence out story , replace it more explosions , perhaps smith .	1

super size me received some good reviews , but film not yet generally recognized masterpiece it most certainly . this one few films clear concept executed perfection . didactic objectives esthetic values not diluted committee whose final product compromise conflicting views objectives . anyone who seen film should recognized making money could not primary objective producer , otherwise he would not so unsparing exposing truth food producers , among most poweful power blocs country . one striking virtues this film how american brand humor used so skillfully illuminate such unhumorous subject national health endemic ! even while laughing , viewer no doubt ever script deadly serious life-and-death subject . could there ever better example than this film how heavy subject treated effectively light-handed , even comic manner ? course laughter fact serious matter , arthur kostler amply noted only few words : " dictators more afraid laughter than they bombs . " but humor hard use except strict comedy or farce . morgan spurlock obviously understands this uses humor abundantly but proper restraint good judgment . he not take unfair advantage those whom he criticizes . he criticizing what people , not who they . he may made people mad , but some those people may fullness time if not before , recognize his criticisms their actions common good , including their own . after all , they endangering their health if they consume their own products . how we not admire guy who offers himself human guinea pig provide evidence what supersized junk food diet human body ? he extraordinary vocation his project deep concern welfare his fellow human beings endanger his health such way . millions americans experiencing impaired health shortening their lives because faulty diet . fact we what we eat . but , alas , our schools doing very bad job educating us how eat right government agencies doing very bad job protecting us against junk food . example , take look food package try decipher what ingredients printed tiny pale yellow characters pale peach background .

i think this ultimate movie definitely collection . instead renting it again again unlock mysteries just buy lock take your time solving puzzles save $$$ too . it not " theater movie " . it home +couch+ solitary movie . these clues helpful only if you watched whole movie :) beginning movie zooms into sleeping woman which means coming up things dream ( dream diane ( dream her name betty ) which she would only " dream " real life ): 1 . car accident rita ( real life camellia ; girl friend diane ) which almost similar one night real life diane when camellia broke her heart breaking up her announcing her marriage movie director . it no less than worse accident diane , which she wanted camellia experience . so there rita only survivor bad car wreck . 2 . real life camellia vamp so diane dreams rita/ camellia lost memory . makes rita very innocent loyal her opposite real life . 3 . real life camellia helping diane getting movie roles but dream betty ( real life diane ) helping rita . 4 . dream betty full life acting talent but reality diane just opposite . 5 . reality diane come canada her aunt place where she living ; so she dreams going her aunt house where she meets rita . 6 . director dream one camellia going marry once party diane overheard director saying " i get pool you get pool man " , which she dreams later . she dreams lot bad poor director . 7 . she also dreams there lots conflict going director producer choice cast lead actress . this shows competition diane camellia real life . camellia director choice . 8 . hit man one she hired kill camellia . 9 . cowboy still puzzle ; he appears 3 times movie . 10 . betty rita discovering body ( diane ??? ) also puzzle . 11 . restaurant scene scary guy still puzzle me . 12 . silencio club part movie hint viewers gives betty puzzle box which she key . when rita unlocks blue box , reality starts : 1 . diane horrible condition she missed camellia . 2 . she knows camellia murdered because hit man returned her blue key . 3 . she so paranoid she kills herself . so basically diane who lost her gf ( camellia ) her murdered dreaming better world till silencio club part movie . when she wakes up she realizes her mistake kills herself .	1

thing i remember most this film when i saw it theater 1990 its honesty . every level . great care taken accurately depict one particular community one particular time -- when aids first diagnosed " gay cancer , " up through mid-eighties , when attending monthly funerals commonplace gay men their friends . though hiv/aids around decade when this movie made , there no effort part filmmakers whitewash past . they not only show ugliness disease , they show ugliness people response it . even within gay community there tendency people fingerpoint , accusing first victims more promiscuous than themselves , or more excessive users amyl nitrate recreational drugs . there fear contamination , reluctance touch or kiss , even intimacy within monogomous relationships hampered . people reached deperately new age cures , louise haye reigning goddess self-healing . choosing depict five-year period , filmmakers allow viewer see lives group friends evolve deepen . some course succumb disease die , others wrestle their losses rethink their lives . end , survivors try become part solution ; they become visiting volunteers political activists . all its authenticity , film not depressing . this incredible ensemble acting its best . campbell scott , bruce davison , mark lamos give especially moving performances , but there no slackers this cast . time movie released , face aids already changing filmmakers criticized focusing exclusively gay victims . i felt then , i continue believe , this misplaced criticism . all fiction self-limited . longtime companion story one small group friends who affected unknown dreadful disease ; it shows how each them responds challenges thrown them . yes , they wealthy or middle-class white men who spent summers together fire island . but longtime companion not celebration their insular lives . fact , end film , one this insular group , campbell scott character , shown working home care volunteer who visits latino man . i think filmmakers , like gmhc time , aware things starting change . it seems me film critics , even 1990 , forgotten aids first announced new york times " gay cancer " later " gay related immune deficiency syndrome " before called aids . but said , we need remember there many other people stories worth telling , including those people living coping aids africa . my only hope these stories told all accuracy sensitivity went into making longtime companion . dvd no significant " extras , " but transfer excellent	1

many reviewers this site said they would want see film focuses hardships extremes immigrants face when coming united states . this , i respond : we've seen hundreds times films . same goes sports films . we've seen movie glory road other films like coach carter , remember titans , hoosiers . they exactly same movie different team . that not say these films aren't decent sports flicks , but film industry needs take step back when making film potential just like every other film its genre . said , exactly what jim sheridan america . story so original acting makes this film glorious triumph . basic story follows family irish immigrants who come america same notion all immigrants : attain american dream . but , they all sooner or later find out , american dream ideology 99.9% people never attain . they trouble finding place stay , end up apartment top run down building many its residents junkies . father johnny ( paddy considine ) struggling actor , who hasn't able get part since death his son frankie , who fell down stairs . mother sarah ( samantha morton ) takes job ice cream parlor earn rent money . oldest daughter christy ( sarah bolger ) probably one smarter people film , sarah bolger gives flawless performance such young girl . she stereotype oldest child who forced grow up too soon . her younger sister ariel ( played sarah bolger younger sister emma ) typical naive little girl who asks fifty questions everything . there some really touching scenes throughout course film , one especially comes mind , where father almost squanders away all family money trying win e.t. doll youngest daughter . there essentially three miracles film , christy , who also narrator , relates these three events set three wishes her brother frankie told her before he died . other great scenes film involve family their relationship man one floors below . when they first arrive house , christy calls him " man who screams . " this man name mateo ( played brilliantly djimon hounsou ) he brilliant artist quite bit emotional problems . he sort figure " morality " film , often giving out endless amounts advice . mateo some sort disease ( we only expect it probably venerial disease ) he gets sick throughout movie . america features one best ensembles i ever seen . every actor perfect every scene . djimon hounsou paddy considine give best performances entire film , jim sheridan wrote directed every gorgeous shot film . while i agree one other reviewer how christy modern camera story set eighties , stupid facts like these should not detract overall message film . overall message , then , not just how immigrants face hardships when they come america ; we already know previous films and/or experiences . film such deeper message , relating not just immigrants , but every person who watches this film . i really not want give message away , but rather i leave it up you go rent or buy this treasure film . this truly one most unforgettable movies i ever seen	1
cast alone makes this great film own - lionel barrymore before pain spinal problems forced him wheelchair , clark gable , norma shearer small part up-and-coming leslie howard . classic story good evil , but who cares who wins when you get watch talent like this when it still young fresh . norma shearer extremely popular time this made gable just beginning climb perverbial hollywood ladder . they genuine chemistry together my favorite english actor , leslie howard , small supporting role but adds stylish noirish feel this film . aside , howard went make many great films , including " gone wind " " petrified forest " ( humphrey bogart bette davis ) , but this great talent killed during ww ii when flying states england . legend lingers today not disproved howard acting undercover agent britain u.s. he taking valuable information britain when his plane shot down june 1 , 1943 . this film , gable seductive shearer loves every moment it , but her father , barrymore , see danger ahead valiantly fails keep his daughter tragedy he sees coming them all . no one could picked better cast this film , smallest part lead . they all superstars their time it wonderful films like this here new generations view . storyline may seem quaint compared today values , but i wish sincerely young people give this film others its genre chance . there not doubt world those every generation beyond 18 truly enjoy " free soul " . they say - " what not like !	1

nicolas roeg curious , ambitious director " man who fell earth " one his most curious ambitious films . made wake success films like walkabout , this film 1 3 movies roeg made it into criterion collection . i've only seen two other roeg films ... walkabout don't look now . i don't think this film better than either those it certainly more flaws , but it definitely trippy experience . david bowie makes his screen debut thomas , alien who comes earth bring water back his dying planet . once earth , he becomes millionaire becoming head huge corporation ; he begins affair young woman mary-lou ( candy clark ) receives help his quest nathan bryce ( very young rip torn ) . bowie makes it clear this film he good actor , even though he looks little like annie lennox film . it hard flaunt acting skills movie like this , because this movie not based plot . fact , plot actually pretty minute part this film . this film more focused its visuals , other roeg films , there plenty . roeg cinematographer , before becoming director it clear he always hand visual style his films . they all unmistakable mark made their creator . man who fell earth couldn't made many directors , because it so essentially built images . usual , roeg comfortable nudity there plenty here . i think walkabout don't look now perfect films if they're not perfect , they're close it . man who fell earth not perfect ... it overlong ( 137 minutes ) , sometimes doesn't enough emphasis plot , but it still worth seeing . it science-fiction film people who don't even like science fiction . if you like stunning cinematography ( or , least , appreciate it ) . i'd recommend definitely checking this movie out . grade :	1

badly neglected both audiences critics time it original release , nuts film ripe reevaluation . based tom toplor 1981 courtroom play , nuts definitely dialogue-based film little hollywood flashiness . though extremely well-written ( toplor , adapting his own work darryl ponicsan alvin sargent ) sharply staged directed veteran martin ritt , it cast whom really responsible bringing nuts life . barbra streisand gives absolutely bravura performance should earned her oscar nomination . alternately hilarious frightening , streisand always mesmerizing she delves so far into character . richard dreyfess nothing less than streisand equal her public defender . he too robbed oscar nomination . supporting cast top-notch ensemble professional character actors ( maureen stapleton , eli wallach , robert webber , james whitmore , karl malden ) , all whom work their craft flawlessly . nuts ' screenplay indulge predictability some typical courtroom-plot conventions little too often , but toplor absorbing script still deserves high praise it fascinating exploration what constitutes normality whether or not insane should required receive treatment . nuts isn't going win over any fans 3-cuts-per-second action films , but it leave lovers thought-provoking , expertly-acted dramas fascinated . dvd : picture quality dark grainy , however , i believe this reflects film intended look . sound fine , it nice film trailer included . streisand intelligent entertaining full-length commentary main extra here , it more than makes up disappointing tracks she contributed what up , doc ? main event dvds	1

" ringer " kind movie where , upon quick glance , most people would assume made strictly shock offend . considering infamous farrelly brothers ( " there something mary , " " me , myself irene " ) stand producers , one could imagine many cheap-shots this movie would take . surprisingly , though , it doesn't . despite restrictions movie gives itself , it quite funny times . despite somewhat predictable plot , it actually bit heartwarming sentimental . apparently , i'm minority people who actually enjoyed this movie . then again , i tried not keep my expectations up too high . starters , this isn't exactly farrelly brothers movie , so don't go expecting type humor . sure , it shows up times , but " ringer " more conventional than those movies . johnny knoxville ( " jackass " ) perfect steve , reluctant participant special olympics , coerced his uncle gary , played brian cox ( " manhunter , " " red eye " ) . steve forced into games part pay off his uncle bookies , but also able afford surgery replace three severed fingers man he hired mow his lawn . plot get bit ridiculous points , you see steve happy-ending lynn ( katherine heigl " bride chucky " ) , volunteer olympics , coming miles away . but despite all , movie good job carrying message without condescending or losing it sense humor . if you look cover dvd or read any reviews feel urge instantly offended , don't . " ringer " quite well-done , actually features many mentally-disabled actors prominent roles . if that not enough you , it also flat-out funny . it simply good comedy decent story interesting original angle . just don't take it too seriously	1

this just great fun anthology horror film george . romero , it also writen stephen king so you probably know what expect when you these two geniuses horror genre together this deffinetely high quality film . creepshow inspired horror comics tales crypt ec comics which released during 50 quite unique bit controversial during period , these five tales quite good alot fun watch especially halloween but still you could watch them any time , during beginning title sequence shot like comic book some nice animation then live scenes happen where bratty kid playing around his horror comic book then his dad finds out gets angry upset well story resolves end film when boy gets his revenge , boy played stephen king son so watch out some bad acting these stories not really scary but you wouldn't mind since they're alot fun watch anyway here short summary these five stories:-father day involves family reunion , ashtray unnatural desire cake . watch out ed harris corny dance sequence zombie rises his grave , very good storyline revenge retribution " where my cake !?! " . lonsome death jordy verill features stephen king dorky dumb farmer who discovers meteor all sorts growth fungus decides touch it , not good idea since now hes turn into plant . this one worst storylines but good thing its short doesn't take long , there some funny parts though . something tide you over tells leslie nielson interesting plan vengeance against man who stole his wife played ted danson . this very good suspensfull storyline keep you edge your seat leslie buries ted danson character sand . crate one my favorites it some wonderful special fx tom savini who made effects monster crate looks like its world quite creepy , story college professor who very loud obnoxious wife played adrienne barbeau who keeps embarissing her husband infront everyone untill opritunity comes get rid her , this story alot twisted dark humor it some gore . they're creeping up you rich greedy eccentric executive type who deal roach problem , this very nice storyline wraps up everything . overall film classic 80 horror film best george romero flick since he more known his living dead trillogy this film also showed he could other things beside , great stuff highly recommended . make sure you also watch sequal this back back , best storyline imo raft where college kids get eaten creature lake .	1
most reviews so far fail make these points : if you not yet seen other films bresson ( such diary country priest ) or certain other austere difficult directors ( tarkovksy mirror comes mind ) , you probably wasting your money if you buy this one -- rent it or get it your library . second , it helps know bresson thinks actors " models " not vehicles plot character development ; they deliver their lines ( what few they ! ) largely emotionless way , result , evidently , repetition point where lines uttered almost unconsciously . third , bresson views almost all what most people call " movies " merely filmed versions theater -- other words , typical movie bresson nothing more than kind play happens filmed . he believes what he pointedly calls " cinema " must something different order find its real potential art : namely , true art film lies creation meaning through juxtaposition images . ( i don't think i know what he means , but that what he says -- all this excellent 1966 french television show accompanies dvd viewers must watch after film itself . ) my own experience : i both frustrated fascinated film but glued it despite its lack narrative arc or traditional emphasis cause effect . i find bresson bleak take human nature this film too dark ( i am not particulary sunny myself human nature ) but am drawn further consider balthazar , other bresson films , future . fact , i woke up next day immediately thinking balthazar am still thinking film two weeks later . rate such film , sense , both foolish beside point . it not " enjoyable " any normal sense yet it clearly masterpiece way many works modern art . you really prepared approach it aesthetic intellectual challenge try understand how meaning might emerge juxtaposition filmed images . oh , i mention donkey might christ figure	1

wow . jeanne moreau marcello mastroianni monica vitti , all same movie together . talk incredible amount screen presence . moreau mastroianni play married couple trapped listless relationship . they keep missing each other , making half-hearted attempts reconnect or least stay same frame together longer than 5 minutes . but they drift apart , mastroianni gravitating towards capitalist society world , moreau wandering off edge screen go long walks herself . empty , abandoned streets make her happy , give her taste life freedom . i think _l'avventura_ , where woman , similarly unhappy her relationship , drifts off edge screen vanishes altogether . but moreau doesn't disappear . she sticks around watch her disintegrating marriage like train wreck , even instigating her husband flirtation vitti , tycoon daughter . i never really understand what motivates characters antonioni films what they . i guess that why i keep watching his films , even when i don't " get " anything solid them , even when watching them isn't exactly " enjoyable . " but i can't stop watching them , probably because they're realistic . they leave me flat feeling , but really really enriched flat feeling , like i've just through trying experience real life can't even begin make sense it or identify what " point " . acting here so different what passes nowadays oscar-winning acting . it totally different concept performance . actors _la notte_ great , not so much because they project character , but because they absorb their characters fully . there withholding quality their presence sometimes makes me feel skeptical their shallowness , or equivalently , their depth . but i never fully doubt , because there always so much substance there , anti-sentimental understated . i want say something like , " though these characters live increasingly technological environment , depersonalized ahistoricized industrial redevelopment , they still carry around heartbreaking sense history . " film begins couple visit dying friend hospital , ends their long night beautiful-people party hosted millionaires . characters aware folly , but they also recognize power disaffection , contradiction , boredom . moreau severe , striking face weighed down sorrow burden active one relationship . she look hunger , neediness she suppresses most time displays caution . mastroianni suave stoic , disillusioned intellectual more than touch opportunism him . vitti highly perceptive , capricious , but resigned ; more than any other character film , she hints possibility unrealized generosity underlying her shiny veneer wealth privilege . all characters seem live aesthetically . i mean , they seem detached their feelings , yet they act them nonetheless . they meta-awareness their actions which might called sophistication . actually , this sensibility rampant among antonioni characters , who almost always drawn upper-class intelligentsia milan or rome . this case , mastroianni character writer , novelist i think . vitti reads literature improvises restless prose poems into tape recorder . we never find out exactly what moreau character , but she take epic long walk during day that work art itself ; she sculpts her experiences feelings out walk , she composes conducts walk . which brings me importance women antonioni films . antonioni , women often function agents moral intelligence otherwise decadent , alienating , careless world . moreau risks her own safety break up fistfight some tough teenagers . vitti disturbed breakdown love mastroianni moreau marriage . ( fact , vitti pretty much excels this function all antonioni films she appears : that why she one my favorite actresses all time . ) these just more visible instances , but general pattern always present : women take experiences give back ethical responses , while men , well , kind adrift lost . they need women sober ground them . i'm struck fragility this need locate moral intelligence other human beings . perhaps that why antonioni characters depend each other so	1
most surprising aspect this 2006 thrill ride movie ninety minutes , it almost half-hour shorter than its 1972 predecessor , blessing really given director wolfgang peterson seems only interested filming action sequences . inspired choice remake , veteran director already proven sharp acumen providing exceedingly cramped , seafaring adventures his classic wwii submarine movie , " das boot " more recent fishing trip-gone-wrong , " perfect storm " . offsetting problem , however , mark protosevich trite screenplay abbreviates character development favor banal dialogue stock responses . net result there little concern fate any characters , especially women who look interchangeable when soaked , no matter how dire consequences . peterson wastes little time , barely fifteen minutes , setting up ten key characters big tidal wave . point , he combines predictably spectacular cgi effects outsized set pieces dramatize familiar journey this group takes find their way hull where they seek safety . one indisputable improvement over original way peterson effectively shows fast elevating water level more realistic way , especially characters swim lot more through submerged air shafts . less realistic way all characters appear swim olympian levels their ability forego oxygen lengthy periods . but set-up gets repetitive , only diversion , albeit minor one , figuring out which character killed next . alpha male , josh lucas cuts reasonable action figure playing gene hackman hero role though more mercenary type given his character professional gambler . relegated second lead , kurt russell seems inheriting ernest borgnine role but not blowhard cop but sensitive former mayor new york ( huh ? ) . they argue periodically what path take , but that only relationship any semblance reality film . no one colorful shelley winters or stella stevens this time , rest actors barely register , including wide-eyed emmy rossum playing russell conflicted daughter jacinda barrett brave mother predictably precocious son . biggest waste normally colorful richard dreyfuss cast rather pathetically gay , suicidal architect who barely says word once action starts . climax gets quite convoluted its technicalities , then it simply ends . there nine minutes end credits end listing multitudes who worked special effects . two-disc 2006 dvd strictly aficionados this genre film several " making " featurettes history channel documentary which looks possibility such waves wreaking such havoc . surprisingly , there little reference 1972 inspiration directed ronald neame . consequntly , there barely enough hold interest over course two discs . unmemorable viewing experience overall	-1

this gem movie probably not blockbuster when released . storyline thin almost non-existent , it could summed up " everyone gets chance screw up second time " . nevertheless , there enough twists turns make what story there interesting . this must sort movie every good actor actress would love role screenplay written accomplished playwright . it farcical melodrama rather than comedy but nonetheless highly enjoyable . film-making team , hard up critical funds , just thrown out small town new hampshire . their movie plot necessitates choice small town new england locale water mill ( one reason why they short funds they build old water mill replica new hampshire town ) . movie begins director his crew find themselves small town vermont ( actually most scenes shot connecticut or massachusetts ) . beauty location well-captured excellent photography . makers " state main " not fall into trap shooting film during fall . new england fall colours would major distraction although alfred hitchcock black comedy " trouble harry " succeeded despite shot vermont peak fall leaf colour season , but then hitchcock exceptional genius . small town going its leisurely way until film crew arrive . obvious star " state main " philip seymour hoffman previously little known hollywood actor whose first appeared screen spoilt rich daddy supported george willis jr. memorable al pacino film , " scent woman " . hoffman key role " state main " author screen play writer movie within movie . better known hollywood star alec baldwin plays lesser role film-in making male star . he portrayed lustful male whose sexual preference under age nubile girls . director played william . macy , who completely unflappable no matter what . producer arrives after crew settled . role played droopy-eyed david paymer , who completely obsessed money bribe anyone get things moving . male star lead almost fatally distracted young teenager ( julia stiles ) . female lead siren , sarah jessica parker , demands substantial extra money appearing naked scene claiming she found religion . hoffman smitten heart attractive young woman ( rebecca pidgeon ) town who engaged or semi-engaged local bad man town councillor . i leave it reader imagination find out if film crew gets second chance screw up again . movie directed david mamet , leading american playwright . mamet wrote screen plays " postman always rings twice " , " untouchables " , minor role performer 1986 thriller " black widow " . he directed several movies aside this one past 17 years . it evident mamet , who also wrote screen play this charming melodrama , loss suitable title film , just like director play , who wanted call his movie " old mill " , only find out , upon arrival vermont town , much advertised " old mill " burnt down 1960 . so mamet settled uninspiring title " state main "" intersection where town brand new traffic lights still stand start movie . interestingly enough title dvd version " state main " circulating greece translated " without title " . i am fairly confident this little known 102 minute movie become movie buff classic one day .	1

i first saw crimes passion theater years ( years ) ago - when i watched dvd edition i realized - nothing outdated . nothing lost translation . this one most powerful , disturbing , yet poignant films i've ever seen - right up there " requiem dream " , " blue velvet . " first all , how you beat performances kathleen turner anthony perkins ? better yet - perkins ' character real ? or he china blue conscience , used pawn elicit doubts insecurities within her , she questions motives morals behind her supposedly safe choices . rest cast - ok - including pre-designing women annie potts - but its turner perkins who steal this show . quite simply , anyone who ever struggled relationships , struggled life general - should able relate this movie . if you scrape off outer layers , wonderful , happy , perfect life yours probably isn't quite so perfect . it might easy some dismiss this way too over top - but would like saying chris rock too funny . bottom line - see this movie .	1

when disney released sword stone onto dvd 2001 , disney only really gotten into releasing their movies onto dvd within last two years , starting their failed limited issue line . gold collection followed , some limited issues repackaged gold collection titles , more titles released . most these decent , if not somwhat problematic dvd transfers few , if any , bonus materials . however , few disney gold collection titles given decent releases . among those 30th anniversary edition bedknobs broomsticks ( although not officially gold collection title many people standards , it says gold collection spine . ) this 2001 dvd release sword stone . first off , film given nice transfer here . dvd case boasts it '' fully restored remastered . '' although it not up par platinum edition restorations or masterpiece edition alice wonderland transfer , it far better than many other gold collection transfers . it nicely cleaned up , although it bit grainier than one would like , there still bit dirt transfer . colors punched up nicely , though . video transfer here very satisfying , audio mix . disc also includes quite few good bonus materials . sword stone scrapbook features concept art film , production photos , character design , concept poster art , official poster art , more . two sing-alongs lifted disney sing-along songs video series provide fun captions two film more memorable songs . film facts ... well , basically . two animated shorts , '' knight day '' '' brave little tailor '' very entertaining . '' music magic : sherman brothers '' shermans talking songs they wrote sword stone , including couple deleted . ( shermans also music magic featurette bedknobs broomsticks , one better , because it also gave little info making film , well its 1996 restoration . ) finally , episode walt disney disneyland tv series included - '' all magic '' 1957 . although this isn't directly related sword stone , its inclusion praised nonetheless . my only disappointment this dvd lack any sort theatrical trailer or tv spot . come , disney ! nonetheless , sword stone fine example disney earliest attempts give their movies deluxe treatment single-disc dvd releases , reserving their 2-disc dvd releases platinum editions ( this year snow white platinum edition dvd released . ) dvd releases their most recent animated features . i wholeheartedly recommend this dvd fans film	1
some people make much ado nothing , but maybe that something . maybe that one thing more than nothing . beatrice smartest girl room - any room . her trouble she loves defiant , bull-headed , notorious man her past . she betwixt herself , not liking she feelings concern her gender rival - benedick . beatrice good humored , disarmingly wickedly tongued , always torn her loves her independence . benedick self-involved , conceited , constantly fighting .

" apartment " directed billy wilder ( some like it hot , double indemnity , sunset boulevard , list goes ) starring jack lemmon , who previously collaborated wilder some like it hot , great film considered many others great film . it american film institute top 100 ( #93 ) roger ebert great movies . i never seen billy wilder film until four or five months ago . after watching film , i'm not sure i like it more than three films mentioned above , but it smart comedic semi-love story features two great performances lemmon shirley maclaine , well others . films idea truly original : lemmon plays c.c. baxter , commonly called bud . he works insurance business ( big surprise wilder film ) trying get promotion unorthodox way . he loans out his apartments executives company , so they carry out affairs women . beginning film , one executives leaves girlfriend , we get one funniest lines film ( i regret say i'm paraphrasing ): man : why all you dames live bronx ? woman : you mean you bring other dames up here ? man : certainly not ! i'm happily married man . funny bit , we learn doctor who lives next bud ( dr. dreyfuss played jack kruschen ) under impression bud sex-machine , one point , asks bud if he'll sell his body science . love angle film fits miss kubelik ( maclaine ) , one women who runs elevator bud building . after getting his promotion ( his boss mr. sheldrake [ played double indemnity , fred macmurray ] asks key his apartment first ) , he finally asks miss kubelik out . she tells him she date , but meet him theatre . this date happens mr. sheldrake , whom she love despite fact he married , frequently tells her he'll leave his wife , never . anyway ; moving away plot , film shot black white point when wilder could easily used color . researching film bit , i discovered he uses black white make colorful events around bud seem dull unammusing . realizing i called this love-story beginning review , i add love story merely facade . it plays like love story , but i think final scene ( final line ) make it clear it really not . i think final line some like it hot ( if you haven't seen some like it hot , don't find out what line advance ) best curtain line ever . before seeing film , i didn't know what line . before seeing this film , i know what final line . me , it didn't sound impressive . after watching film , when you view line context , it really good . wilder knack ending his movies kind note he oh so perfectly . i said , earlier ... this isn't my favorite movie wilder cannon , but it wonderful film combining just right amount comedy drama way only wilder could it . grade : a-	1

demetrius gladiators very good movie , classic sense term . many people his time adored victor mature , while critics sometimes claimed he melodramatic , but mature impressively right majority films which he cast . studio system smart way . this case , mature brings drama life almost single-handedly , certainly carries off this cast-of-thousands sequel robe beautifully . mature well suited 50s sword-and-sandal trend , i'd say this film , demille equally good samson delilah , among his best performances period . this film respectable interesting sequel robe , unequivocally worth seeing . what more , i can't agree jay robinson " over top " -- he just fascinating villain he robe , we're lucky more him role this movie . considering robinson became , all accounts , mentally obsessed his character roman emperor these two films rest his life , i'd say this movie even more fascinating regard . robinson one those actors who proves old saying it only takes one stand-out performance secure actor place history forever . robinson performance easily best roman emperor ever committed celluloid up until now , i claudius notwithstanding . short , don't sell this movie short , or you'll worse it . movie tone certainly different robe , but it genuinely satisfying hollywood entertainment fairly high order . budget generous , cast excellent , movie looks very good all most important aspects result . feel free bring popcorn , i'd recommend kleenex well .	1

nos amours movie once seen , never forgotten . it dredges up gut-churning mix jealousy , impotence , fear aging leave you feeling empty afraid sound your girlfriend slamming door behind her last time . not anything so dramatic happened me . pialat always compared cassavetes , probably because each them pose , literally cassavetes ' case , prospero figures whose idea directing " let it happen , " conjure elements , without imposing their . this supposed humble self-effacing approach yet films both men secretly clamor more better than other films , very often . films cassavetes , however , became increasingly florid expressionistic ( more interesting ) deeper he tried get bare-bones truth . pialat i think more consistent this pretense objectivity -- his films all acute probing psychological level minnie moskowitz except much less sunny . i've seen nos amours described all over internet his " best film " people who apparently taking faith since they haven't seen anything else him , usually going then state he minor talent . correct them : there nothing minor pialat , nos amours his most immediately striking film , but not his best . there no best when you're dealing artist pialat caliber . story young girl named suzanne self-immolating journey into sex much more hysterical overacting than any other pialat feature gives impression raw intensity his other films belie . this why most americans would probably consider it his best but what i missed pialat usual tactic making film revolve entirely around banal conversations , digressive plotlines unrelated , out-of-nowhere scenes all seem dance around unspeakable void -- just seems loom larger larger more people try avoid it . think gerard depardieu le garcu , taunting his wife new husband eating his jam toast every day 3:00 dot , seeming good-natured , but inwardly feeling like obsolete sex toy relegated garage . or jean yanne visits his aged , doddering father autobiographical we won't grow old together , which seem retrospectively taunt futility stormy arguments yanne marl�ne jobert . drama pialat movies always tempered knowledge one day none this matter . this strategy missing relatively straightforward nos amours , or it even more cleverly hidden ? i wonder . what i noticed while watching this dvd , i missed first viewing , family pressures interpersonal wounds inflicted suzanne painful but almost irrelevant , sort psychological macguffin . ( pialat would say psychology itself one big macguffin -- there only love no-love , faith no-faith . ) one character who gets little attention , just couple fleeting scenes , suzanne first boyfriend luc , but he key tragedy . suzanne cheats him once pointlessly , if sleepwalking , american soldier , luc rejects her . it may not seem matter . but then there scene where suzanne talking luc one her friends , friend asks " he handsome ? " " ohhh , oui ! " suzanne says , her face lighting up only time movie , before quickly dissolving into her trademark fixed sneer . this kind sock-in-the-gut moment endlessly forgiving gentle -- where others would just see tramp , pialat sees terrible innocence . next time you go adult website remember many girls there once just like suzanne , many them carrying image luc around them they walk through fire . kicker even if suzanne family caring wise , she would same thing , slept just many guys , because , though too naive understand anything like christian concept , she rejected perfect love now unconsciously flagellating herself , trying crucify herself through sex . this where movie gets fascinating -- all screaming shouting suzanne family just noise meant distract . pain resides somewhere much deeper , somewhere farther back , each them suffering its incommunicability ( how could suzanne father understand sights smells , specific nostalgia , her experience luc ? how suzanne understand what her father experienced his youth ? yet they same experience . ) scorching power movie comes pialat going deep far back possible , back bite apple , back wound side , facing truth most people spend their lives denying -- first love only love , then you're dead . world dead . far leaving no recourse action , this understanding where real action , real love -- basis pialat films , " amour " opposed " nos amours " -- begin .	1

robert newton hands down ultimate pirate . i'm sure , if he still alive , would offered starring role disney production " pirates carribean " . johnny depp terrific jack sparrow , just little too swishy my taste , but funny none less . this movie holds up well even todays ultra violence cgi , plenty swashbuckling swordplay adventure keep kiddies interested . way little historic note-pirates drank rum because water ship often rancid undrinkable after so many months sea . yo , ho , ho	1

movie more famous style than substance , though it set movie world its head . third-rate hood paris ( jean-paul belmondo ) , who thinks he bogart , steals car , then kills policeman who pulls him over . now lam he goes his girlfriend ( jean seberg ) asks her hide him until he collect some money owed him previous job ; after he tells her they go rome . but seberg empty , soul-less , finally ruthless he , end she turns him police . but it way goddard relates story everyone ga-ga over this movie masterpiece : he presented new ways viewing his material - fast-cutting , imaginative camera angles , total breakdown time space , no transitions . his idea give impression " living moment . " there some memorable scenes , especially bedroom scene belmondo seberg discussing art philosophy final shot seberg , but times it very hard relate these two conscienceless , amoral characters ; i know it all alienation impetuosity , but whew ! location photography streets paris superb set precedent new wave filmmaking . excellent too musical score ( part jazz , part classical ) . it extremely influential movie , groundbreaking revolutionary , though some it most creative techniques ( jump-cutting , example ) become second nature today	1
while most films fall under giallo banner far more style than substance , this one rises far above all . among dario argento finest works , it eerie psychological thriller which part hitchcock , part raymond chandler novel , part cinecitta . story believable captivating , suspense chilling , acting superb . course there great music , ennio morricone helm sounds , course there all kinds good-looking people , cool cars , stylish set pieces , just you'd expect italian film 1970 . but this film those extras minor attractions , film itself what keeps you watching	1

me , heathcliff one most complex compelling characters ever written i once thought any actor would fall short playing him film or miniseries . watched this beautiful haunting adaptation one my favorite novels all time , i say ralph fiennes more than succeeded bringing aforementioned anti-hero life . emily bronte would proud . everyone who read wuthering heights knows tragic love story cathy heathcliff how he becomes dark , brooding , manipulative , diabolical man who takes his revenge people who he feels wronged him torn him away cathy , including her daughter his own child ward . fiennes brings out heathcliff many conflicting emotions flawlessly his performance floored me . juliette binoche cathy linton/catherine earnshaw great well . supporting cast quite splendid too -- no cardboard cutout performances here ! backdrop moors beautiful gothic , just like bronte described them her book . i am very impressed this adaptation . i haven't seen 1939 film adaptation or miniseries masterpiece theater yet , but i wonder if they come close this wonderful film . bbc produce adaptation some time next year i think richard armitage ( north south ) would make wonderful heathcliff because he too could bring many nuances his acting . meantime , i shall treasure this one watch it over over again	1
i've always loved this movie , now i own it dvd , i able watch it time again bring back great memories	1

my view garbo greatest film , her most personal . among my other favorites camille ninotchka , but queen christina her stand-out classic above all others . i read garbo personally exicted involved this production extent unparalled her , motivated swedish ( her homeland ) history opportunity play one history most enigmatic figures , queen who " abdicated her throne love " ( though this portrayal , course , largely " hollywoodized " -- you probably throw most expectations historical accuracy out window , just set back behold ) . here every aspect legendary garbo one film : breathtakingly beautiful woman , amibiguous sexuality , great tragienne , aloofness , boyish playfulness , restless longing escape any enforced tableaux or expectations others live her own life her own terms , all things she common queen christina . here also her warm , memorable final pairing her former real-life amor frequent co-star john gilbert . two legendary scenes stand out : garbo walking , if daze , memorizing inn room which she gilbert just spent night ( scene almost lost due censors ) , course final , unforgettable closeup , greatest closeup history cinema -- simply stunning , heartbreaking farewell dying gilbert moments before . not missed scenes also garbo running out castle into bitter cold , rubbing snow her face like child , warm relationship her elderly attendant , . aubrey smith , who dotes her like daughter , combing her hair , tending her every need tender love protectiveness . -- one overlooked subtexts film parentless christina relationships two major father figures , lewis milestone ( frequent co-star ) palace official , who vehemently protests christina decision step down throne , personal attendant , . aubrey smith , his benevolent , mark twain face , caring christina motherly fashion , wanting only her happiness , wherever takes her .... life garbo indeed appeared reclusive aloof , though i suspect she simply very shy person who perhaps never fully comprehended what it we all wanted her . but here , queen christina , actress woman merge . garbo opened up us way she never before would never again , fully showing us both her great strength acute vulnerability , result spellbinding , treasure forever , garbo gift us all , we all beneficiaries .	1

fran�ois truffaut first film english language still stands up well , my opinion . it very fine adaptation ray bradbury book . i wonder what it says us today ? possibly quite lot . world which story takes place look , superficially , inviting . maybe this what it means living police state ? guy montag , played great style oskar werner , cool character ( forget moronic american meaning word " cool " here ) , he isn't passionate lives rather passionless life . millie montag , his wife , played julie christie , who also plays role clarice . film powerful because it rarely overstates its case keeps violence minimum . film " futuristic " mid-sixties , when it made , it decidedly ' 60s look it now . however , it present us people who forgotten books get their kicks very large -interactive tv screens - not would ever happen , would it !	1

men certain age remember how , when we kids this played tv early 80s , we thought it so cool when huge army police officers fired so many shots into house it eventually collapsed , when bus shot full holes even larger army cops . but those two over-the-top scenes all this movie going it . other action scenes pretty silly unbelievable , especially scenes involving sniper helicopter , atop parking structure , both whom " can't miss " positions missed anyway . moreover , if you know anything law plot beyond silly . it involves eastwood sent phoenix las vegas escort witness extradited back arizona trial . witness testify bad behavior part phoenix police commissioner , corrupt assistant district attorney involved commissioner coverup . assuming material witness extradited , which i doubt , crime appears committed vegas , so it would tried vegas , not phoenix . if ada prosecuting case corrupt wanted cover commissioner , he could just dismiss case , there would no need murder witness . idea they would want draw attention case 200 cops line up try assassinate witness beyond ridiculous . sum , plot action both absurd , only interesting scenes crazy firepower overkill house bus . but those two scenes probably can't carry entire movie average viewer .	-1
this movie part canadian soap opera part effective slasher movie . plot ripoff prowler , or vice versa ( either way , prowler much better movie , go see instead ) . it deals vengeful wraith promising spree if valentine party ever held after tragic holiday party-to-blame accident coal mine left one survivor resort cannibalism unemployment . coarse you know them crazy kids go party anyways . basically , anything killer miner or mine itself great , but everything else just plain tacky . john stanley creature features guide gave it 4 stars ... i've decided anything he says good automatically bad . i can't believe band actually decided ripoff this particular piece pop culture sell records . its not because they drugs but because they imagination-less state not doing drugs	-1

when you watch fred ginger ( fg ) movie you expect see two them dance together . their seventh film together , shall we dance , you don't see their first dance routine until literally half way through film ( unless you count walking dog dance ) . way harriet hoctor bends backwards final dance number incredible . her body must made rubber . she probably better dancer than ginger , but because she not speak or act , we don't appreciate her much . title suggests , featurette " they can't take away me : music shall we dance " emphasizes songs movie . there some good information composers , george ira gershwin . you know origin song " let call whole thing off " based how fg pronounced certain words ? it includes interviews ava astaire mckenzie ( daughter ) , archivists , biographers mix fg photographs film clips .

this very well made film . director excellent . only complaint i ending . relationship two leading characters isn't clarified enough . young woman sincere her affection her older man ? yes . no . yes . definitely not , she just playing him what she get , love younger man . no wait , yes she loves him . wait , hold , why she walking away ? older man annoying , odd hero we don't want him get what he wants , we want him fail , because he rich , stuck up , without redeeming social value . young girl tells him he knows nothing women . it seems what she really wants dominated smacked . but no , maybe that not what she wants . well , yes , it seems what she wants . interspersed all this comic ambiguity , we treated random acts terrorism . blooey ! rich pig dead . when it our hero turn dead rich pig ? end movie , maybe ? he sure made uncomfortable reports terrorism . it seems terrorism natural reaction , mobilized lower class , entrenched despicable upper class . this film very french . it enough quality its manufacture get five stars , but it fizzles away very end , leaving me wondering just what hell happening our loving couple relationship before it time bring down curtain them . smack me , won't you ? i've given you every reason . oww . good , now i know you love me	1

okay , if you don't like this movie then my opinion your not horror movie fan . anyone who grew up 1980 knows loves jason voorhees ! only reason you wouldn't fan because your one those stuck up , horror movie snobs who only likes movies such halloween other over rated played out slasher flicks . jason goes hell - final friday ( only it wasn't last ) one more creative friday 13th movies ever made ! sure there might some rather small plot holes here or there but thats no big deal . considering series gone this far , i think it amazing director pulled off something so creative ! instead jason run through woods entire film , chopping up teenagers who bearly act , director decided go different direction . movie starts typical friday 13th scene , attractive woman all herself camp crystal lake . she walks one cabins then eventually decides take shower . pretty stypical stuff usual slasher movie bimbo . soon enough however , we ( fans ) discover she member government s.w.a.t team , sent destroy jason voorhees . jason killer tons people , i'm actually quite shocked government ( or whoever handles there situations ) hadn't stepped sooner ! anyways , they find jason unleash everything they got him . after shooting him bunch bullets finally blowing his body bloody chunks , everyone thinks jason finally dead . what they don't know they're dead wrong ! ( sorry silly pun ) here where i think jason goes hell well . director explains how jason able come back all those times , through all those sequals . it actually idea i myself early days 80 sequals . jason heart takes shape form some creature hell . whenever host body ( whoever jason happens using time ) becomes too nasty it use anymore , it basically uses host . otherwords , it simple body snatchers plot . rest movie we watch helpless victems fall prey jason demon heart , taking over their bodies . soon we discover plot detail helps movie but us friday 13th fans , know it plot hole . no big deal considering it dosn't hurt anything long run actually helps story movie better . jason sister ( if you remember first friday 13th , jason mother said she only one child ) order become reborn again , he needs take over her body . you tell , jason goes hell alot more plot details creative story twists than most other ones series . i won't go into anymore detials movie , you just sit back watch blood fly ! ending also treat us horror fans too ! something any respected friday 13th fan waited see many years eventually blessed it later down road . i won't spoil anything if you haven't seen movie , you'll just watch it . over all , jason goes hell - final friday wonderful addition anyones friday 13th series gore hounds should enjoy much here ! it fun movie gives fans what they want see . more plot , more story , more gore ( get unrated version ) more jason ! anyone who thinks they're " above " this movie terms horror fan , get lost ! you don't belong here ! obviously slasher scene isn't you .	1

if you find " greatest story ever told " believable , where jesus speaks rich baratone people , not people ; if you think yeshua always frowning or serious ; if you trouble thinking son man dumping bucket cold water over peter head laughter , then you might not like how this move portrays our christ . looking some reviews here i'm surprised people can't see jesus smiling . if it true he man , then he must some fun besides just healing sick . it written he not characteristics drew people him ( he wasn't glamourous , wasn't flashy , probably didn't even " look you want know better " ) , scriptures seem point us someone who pretty ordinary appearance , but who performed extraordinary acts kindness dregs society . remember , he not call rightous , but sinners . speaking seasoned sinner myself , i wouldn't listen barratone who spoke me , not me . i wouldn't believe he could much capacity compassion if he just " purdy boy " . i wouldn't take him seriously if he never smiled . whereas one reviewer said he found gospel john more realistic , i found version far less realistic because he too glamourous , too suave , besides , he perm . my vote gospel according matthew . i watched this move well over two dozen times i'm still learning it . it also amazing me how producers could make book seem coheriant without interjecting single additional word not niv	1

according long , interesting interview writer , jean-claude carriere , assistant director , jean lary , which came my disc ( studio canal : reg 2 ) , all masochistic footage this film extremely thoroughly researched before its release 1967 . these all " real " fantasies recounted real women . those parts film which superficially presented real , therefore , ie idea doctor wife would actually spend her afternoons humiliated maison de joie , fantastic ; fantasy sequences actually " real " . disorienting , isn't it ? first question if these female fantasies dominated brutal men repeated today , 40 years later . seems unlikely . next question if anything story real . isn't whole thing completely surreal ? nothing what unfolds need actually happened all , including bit husband shot sitting paralysed wheelchair : it all his wife dream . why husband shown staring empty wheelchair street one scene ? wife may even fantasised molested little girl , also fantasises her husband helplessly passive baby , who needs looked after --- since she hasn't child her own . idle bourgeois wife --- one bunuel typical targets --- nothing else occupy her mind during day . film promoted " erotic " . sells tickets . it didn't seem erotic me slightest , fact it all very cold intellectual puzzle . whole scenario highly unemotional artificial : elegant home couple , their smart clothes , tidy , domestic brothel , stereotypical customers , stereotypical gangsters their pulp fiction dialogue behaviour . photography seemed flat , without depth , assistant director comments darkness shadows deliberately avoided . since i find puzzles fascinating , it very interesting entertaining watch . kubrick clumsy eyes wide shut seems inspired it , just his clumsy shining inspired last year marienbad . both these french films intellectually far superior anything produced hollywood these days .	1
like del toro " pan labyrinth " which made huge waves non-hollywood world , " devil backbone " not easily categorised . ghost story ? yes , but much more . picture scary tensions spain early days civil war ? yes , but more . wonderful tale how group children mature amid disaster tragedy come almost their own family , replace ones they never or separated ? yes , but more . rich symbols allegory ... yes , but ... richness what . . eliot called " objective correlative " gives one sense underlying depth . instance , there huge unexploded bomb stuck middle school courtyard . what it but metaphor hidden ghastly secret waits explode reveal reason mysterious ghost boy santi ? we only find out santi story near end . then there devil backbone itself - reality congenital deformity where spine exposed , but spooky-looking sample floating jar preservative - doesn't jacinto exactly match name ? irredeemable core evil , like shakespeare villain or captain pan labyrinth . del toro doesn't want claim there something good everyone : he says no , some characters just irreversibly turned dark side , very backbone evil . then there subtle end-to end connections add more richness . early scene school classroom , children shown picture mammoth teacher makes point these days creatures so big strong hunters could only succeed working closely together group . end , children - survived - exactly they hunt gunman , pointed wooden spears yet ! i don't really agree reviewers who see strong parallel " lord flies . " children here ( wonderfully acted , way ) don't regress primitive kind anarchical ritual-filled state : fact they bond ever more closely deal very directly real world around them . one thought : seen this , i now don't think any more pan labyrinth we absolutely , definitely meant take ofelia fantasy scenes all her mind . clearly del toro doesn't mind creating " real " supernatural entities . perhaps " pan " he just wants leave us state permanent uncertainty , though majority view among reviewers it literally just fantasy .	1

now i saw some reviews site some bad some go way far into plot . now adult i'm going rate this . pokemon first all show follows ash ketchum aboy who begins adventure catch train pokemon-creatures inhabit his world . it pretty much childrens show but movie really strong theme . it begins scientist funded giovonni , corupt mad man charge lethal organization . now scientists recovered fossil said remains legendary pokemon mew , also first one existence . cloning process successful but mewtwo soon discovered humans care nothign him rebelled against his creators . once giovonni betrayed him mewtwo adamant destroy humanity thining humans all same . doing he brings forth greatest trainers planet clones their pokemon . movie teaches greatest lesson learned- we all different but if you look past differences focus what we common then perhaps we so much more . good lesson hidden inside chaoticly famous series	1
this big dumb action thriller , i mean best possible way . sure , it not die hard ... however i don't think it fair compare every bruce willis movie one greatest action movies ever made . it more than it fair share excitement plot enough twists turns keep me occupied . opening car chase top notch . there quite few excellent character actors who turn great performances here ... look tom sizemore , robert pastorelli , andre braugher , timothy busfield ( well his spindly little girl legs ) . it not going change world . it not going make you forget die hard . it fun thriller ... especially couple friends , some popcorn , few beers . worth rental !	1

this retelling snow white seven dwarfs actually based script billy wilder wrote before immigrating united states germany , but it only after success disney version demand created it . enormously versatile howard hawks ( quite literally most versatile director film history , only director mastered and/or created five or six genres ) took script turned it into one last great pre-ww ii comedies . story simple : group monkish scholars living together new york city writing encyclopedia . one them writing slang , but unfamiliar contemporary argot begins research his topic talking people outside his normal range acquaintance . he runs into gangster moll sugarpuss o'shea , who takes advantage scholars move them order escape police , who want talk her implicate her guy joe lilac . while hardly snow white , she certainly managed stir up their lives . film made wonderful number things : wilder clever script , hawks typically deft direction , solid performance gary cooper , but most all scintillating job overwhelmingly alluring barbara stanwyck stellar collection veteran character actors playing seven dwarves . all latter great , but special mention made richard haydn ( who excells even beside others , his extraordinary overpronounciation everyday words ) , oskar homolka , s.z. sakall . there few more delightful collections character actors any hollywood comedy . i personally prefer barbara stanwyck any other actress hollywood history . she possessed emotional immediacy no other actress could approximate , while her skills perhaps tad below those someone like katherine hepburn , latter never managed match her fire passion . she so sexy ! i grew up watching stanwyck big valley , so when i first started seeing her great roles thirties , forties , fifties , i absolutely stunned how sexy she could . she attractive , yes , but sexier than she attractive . she never sexier than she here , exception her role same year lady eve . reason see this film appearance gene krupa early nightclub sequence . krupa , course , benny goodman throughout thirties , so this very early his career leader his own band .	1
i'm sorry , i love gina gershon i looking forward watching this movie since i like action films . but this such run mill martial arts flick . i wasn't even intrigued watch whole thing without hitting fast forward button through most show . basis this movie - main character expert martial artist who comes town just rising aryan militia becomes prominent nearby . it starts them killing black preacher everyone loves who promotes people stop hate , white boys militia don't like . * gasp , i never would guessed*main character kicks everyone behind , gets girl , acting horrible plot could pasted any flick action film . your time could better spent watching paint dry . or if you're desperate something like this then watch universal soldier , least it funny	-1

before her death 2003 age 101 , filmmaker leni riefenstahl would you believe she no affiliation nazi party when she asked adolf hitler document momentous four days leading 1934 nuremberg rally . however , it obvious her concurrently celebrated reviled 1935 propaganda film she mesmerized hitler oratorical skills judging dynamic way she captured his undeniable charisma . she shows remarkable deftness editing techniques camera movement placement remains gold standard among documentarians . riefenstahl succeeds making hitler larger than life figure masses without resorting editorial commentary validate what obvious images . film begins hitler arrival nuremberg personal aircraft where he greeted enthusiastic throngs nazi supporters . fact , first third film focuses primarily civilian support fuehrer then transitions opening reich party congress where we see familiar historical figures , such rudolf hess joseph goebbels , speak . this leads third day activity rather unsettling shots hitler youth they prepare greet hitler rows teepees which they camped . her discriminating use close-ups most striking here when we see tow-headed aryan boys hypnotized hitler speech . film ends startlingly choreographed rally famous shot hitler , flanked heinrich himmler viktor lutze , walking down emptied aisle place wreath wwi memorial ( shot replicated george lucas end first " star wars " ) . climax designed celebratory hitler leads masses toward unity under reich his fanatical delivery . like d.w. griffiths ' " birth nation " , it difficult defend intended messaging behind such trenchant film , yet it criminal not recognize powerfully cinematic sense which riefenstahl imbues her work . 2001 synapse dvd contains good though not outstanding print transfer . however , there two worthwhile extras - extremely informative commentary track historian dr. anthony . santoro ( which i recommend you switch immediately fully appreciate individual personalities historical details behind rally ) short riefenstahl made following year rally celebrate wehrmacht ( german army ) , " day freedom " . there little use attempting any sort objectivity this film it intended evoke strong emotions sole goal solidifying reich country still feeling weakened wwi . this respect , riefenstahl succeeds admirably	1

i never saw this film theater , so i can't completely sure this how it supposed look . but , assuming dvd transfer accurate , i find all praise kore-eda " painterly " visuals completely undeserved . film shot entirely natural light ; so , daytime indoor scenes , glare windows doorways blots out or silhouettes everything ; nightime indoor scenes , everything murky underexposed . it all looks horribly amateurish . outdooor scenes come off somewhat better , but slightly grainy overall , almost if they shot digital camera . cinematography ( possible bad transfer ) aside , there also matter kore-eda excessively static direction . i appreciate still , quiet camera work ozu or jarmusch , but kore-eda takes this style pushes it ridiculous lengths . his camera never moves , not even occasional cut or panning or tracking shot . it just sits there , dull inert , while scenes drag then abruptly end , almost arbitrarily . i guess this technique supposed impart contemplative effect scene , but again , it just seems amateurish . performance fashion-model-turned-actress makiko esumi , grieving young widow yumiko , reflects director numb , soporific visual style . instead quietly torn grief , she comes across merely affectless . maybe director wanted use zombie-like non-actress comatose camera work convey numbness grief , but result far edifying or moving or even interesting . ultimate effect this movie only stupefying boredom .	-1
i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1
very interesting movie dian fossey , dedicated conservationist dedicated her life preserving mountain gorillas . she bit crazy - no doubt it , but very dedicated . movie takes place congo , then moves rwanda when fossey kicked out congo . other sources , movie not all accurate , but what movie ? it gets main points right , it makes compelling movie . downsides my point view 1 . romance , which , since this hollywood , way overdone , 2 . incessant coughing dian fossey - so she smoked ? she didn't die lung cancer - why we listen her cough whole movie - why get one fact so accurate when they distort so many other aspects movie ? 3 . why she so dedicated these gorillas ? she gets little crazy some points . overall good movie worth watch - scenery africa really great	1

legend suriyothai most expensive movie ever made thailand , production funded royalty itself . visually , suriyothai must most enthralling film i've ever seen . dead-on awesome costumes , superb cinematography sets ( which filmed real historical sites ) just tremendous , worthy academy awards . scale so huge , movie needs viewed least twice . however , suriyothai flawed many reasons . first , original version actually 4 hours long (!) , scaled down just 2 1/2 , understandably suite western audiences . i've seen original version thailand must say though it drag , it much better more depth version released west . however , this skeletal version consequence scaled down , so fact , half movie missing other words . pretty unfair , my opinion . secondly , i would expected more well-choreographed fight scenes . say least , collosal battles pretty clumsy ill-directed . so , don't expect much braveheart-style combat . movie such extravaganza deserves more than just uninspired battle scenes . basically , initial flaw would come result movie scaled down . characters appear dissapear . most main characters paperthin development we sometimes forget who who times . i watch movie three times understand movie entirely . nonetheless , if you patience interest seeing into history nation far away , this definate movie check out . i would advise watching movie first before you buy it , since suriyothai definately quot ; like-itquot ; or quot ; hate-itquot ; camp . i personally love this movie , since i see it potential seen original version . story epic proportions if understood correctly , i would even say it one best . better than hollywood far .	1
story wonderful other reviewers attest . its shame audio video quality subpar american standards . much also lost cutting film fullscreen ( 4:3 ratio ) . older chinese films don't seem get same quality or quantity releases newer ones . techinical purists may gag , but this may only chance own this great film , even if it its lesser glory	1

richard lester refreshingly breezy adaptation dumas classic one best interpretations this venerable classic . he combines elements swashbuckling swordplay satirical buffooneries pink panther movies . michael york , scrawny yet efficient , plays d'artagnan youthful exuberance . raquel welch hilarious bumbling , accident prone constance , spike milligan likewise hoot her aging lustful husband . musketeers played oliver reed , frank finlay richard chamberlain , dashingly heroic , if little out shape ? faye dunaway cold calculating lady dewinter while geraldine chaplin quite coquettish queen . rounding out marvelous cast charlton heston , christopher lee , simon ward jean pierre cassel . lester filmed this its sequel ( four musketeers ) same time , but studio opted go sequel whole movie would too long . they both fine films , although follow up little darker tone . well worth viewing good time	1

i read lord flies high school intrigued its unusual content . i , course , dissect book expose its ' symbolism , ' but unlike many works poetry literature , i agreed this one actually made statement . when remake came out i anxious see how filmmakers would interpret disturbing island living young boys . film stuck book surprisingly accurate manner . before watching film , read book . it improves entertainment value movie makes everything make more sense . i not disappointed film seen it more than once	1
little heavy unfortunate accidents main character , but still great comedy	1
i first saw this film when i 21 . its simplistic symbolism left me cold . i saw it again , 10 years later . it simplistic symbolism made me weep . i knew why . yes , la strada movie very mundane premise ( life ) which reduces man/woman relationship its most base . men , their most primal , selfish brutes . woman , left unnutured , masochistic twits . fellini offers stark staggering perspective humanity which forces us relate characters whom we see appaulling pathetic , yet uncomfortably close all us , left same options . ending obvious , but it says it all . btw : woody allen made regrettable remake la strada entitled " sweet lowdown " , no credit given original ( far i know . )	1

i lived small village andalucia many years . i am very grateful i appreciate this film what it , visual love poem place , people passions region gatlif previous film latcho drom all roma culture . gatlif pays meticulous attention every detail how flamenco music its people infuse help define everyday spanish life this day . it begins remarkable homage flamenco muslim heritage featuring living flamenco legend , tomatito . although much lost translation subtitles , lovers simpler , truly family-centered life treasure poignant , visually satisfying vignettes modern spanish village life . entire family living together lovingly caring disabled family member . gathering pomegranates together . enormous paella outside cooking serve 50 family members christening . people greeting one they get bus ( this scene heartbreakingly delightful short dvd which takes place sun-parched , narrow city streets almeria gypsy neighborhood . ) . cemetery rituals . painted shutters lace curtains windows . family widows - harvesting olives , whitewashing graffiti off village walls , cleaning up after previous nights ' flamenco party . spontaneous outbursts clapping , singing dancing occur anywhere - street , under tree , bus . these all scenes still visible every day ; they not staged movie . melodrama this film no different polite , socially acceptable melodramas play out every day our own society ; reputations , families , relationships destroyed very refined , sanitary , occult manner . spanish , gypsies particular , no concern such posturing show what their heart all see , even if it darkest pangs human emotions . this comes unequaled , boundless complexity depth flamenco . i very fortunate study flamenco andalucian gypsy who grew up learned spain greatest flamenco artists , among them her most beloved dancer , carmen amaya . understand this film , flamenco , spain , one must abandon all attempts understand it allow duende - spirit flamenco - possess one senses one soul . flamenco not contrived enough worry itself theme , story line or impressing audience . it arises place deep within soul most us keep carefully guarded shut off . gatlif exposed it , once again , us experience i'm certain success enough him .	1
stunning " audioscape " pure flamenco . only reason this film not get 5th star me its over-acting simplistic plot . but maybe that not such bad thing . it would take focus away power music cinematography . you literaly pause movie any point , find perfect shots rich blends colors textures capture essence this film , not mention look like museum-exhibit-quality photos . but it both cinematography music made this film so stunning . best scene far old man woman team under tent open field , belting out complex soul-stirring notes simply voice guitar . true story this film its music . now , how soundtrack ???!!!	1

" la belle noiseuse " , directed jacques rivette , splendid albeit admittedly extremely long film manages make spectator understand possibilities dangers distinctive art . extremely good painter bare soul his subject , but not always good thing , specially if artist ruthless eye concentrates worse moral traits his model . when it time stop ? real artist betray himself his art not paint what he seeing ? problem edouard frenhofer ( michel piccoli ) faced , when he choose his art his wife . frenhofer , extremely famous artist , decided stop painting portrait called " la belle noiseuse " , because he knew his model , his wife liz ( jane birkin ) , would hate results . according liz , " he wanted paint me because he loved me . he stopped painting me because he loved me " . many years later , frenhofer gets chance finish his painting , thanks visit admirer , young painter named nicolas ( david bursztein ) . nicolas suggests his beautiful girlfriend , marianne ( emmanuelle b�art ) , could new nude model " la belle noiseuse " . frenhofer loves idea , liz . even marianne , mad first nicolas his suggestion , ends up embracing challenge . however , days go frenhofer marianne become immersed world their own , nicolas liz start feel restless , abandoned . they know new painting make difference , things never same them their loved ones . but they something ? it enough ? course , answers those questions don't really matter , you discover them soon enough if you watch this film . what important , then ? my opinion , director wants show us process creation through eyes artist his model , hard choices sometimes must sometimes made order create real work art . it worth it ? how much himself others should artist willing risk ? those , my point view , real questions " la belle noiseuse " makes you ask yourself . whole , i say i really liked this film , but i don't recommend it everybody . if you just looking engaging movie entertaing you make you laugh , " la belle noiseuse " not you . other hand , if you mood relatively little known jewel amaze disturb you , making you think , watch this dvd . belen alca	1

gremlins 2 should definately considered superior sequel . everything this movie top notch b-flicks usually not case . even critics who despised first gremlins gave this movie good reviews . so much creativity put into this film it surprises me spielburg didn't return project(joe dante return ) . everything character development , stage settings , music , overall story well thought out you tell actors enjoyed playing their parts good time set . gremlins 2 no means takes itself too seriously . first portion movie gives you impression it rushed though it doesn't end up way . four characters including gizmo return first gremlins gremlins themselves designed bit differently though it definately better . regarding my comment creativity this movie , you must see it yourself . this gremlins sequel ( superior sequel , mind you ) gets dvd treatment it deserves like terminator 2 terms bonus features ( okay , terminator 2 alot more but you get my point ) . each feature worth viewing there also some easter eggs a.k.a hidden features . first i hoped gremlins 3 but i don't see how it would rank up this one . even if you happened not care much first gremlins , you still should give gremlins 2 look . i honestly know someone who didn't care too much gremlins but told me they really enjoyed sequel	1
movie jam-packed full actors who gone acclaim , director ang lee presents dark winter suburbs during ice storm . movie perfectly captures look feel 1970s-even pacing seems completely appropriate . characters middle sexual revolution-married men women clandestine unfulfilling liaisons , teenagers experimenting , hipsters neighborhood holding wife-swapping " key party .

make no mistake ; " chato land " sprawling , unforgiving environment offers little water no reward . blistering , sprawling landscape rock sagebrush , however , but backdrop this story shows man his most ugly moments . charles bronson stars pardon chato , half apache indian who enjoying drink saloon when he antagonized arrogant sheriff . chato goes against sheriff wishes leave because his heritage , lets his actions speak themselves , leaving mouthy lawman dead floorboards . posse soon rounded up variety area men , many them farmers ranchers . they embark trip find chato avenge death town , well feed some their own continual hatred towards indians general . greed , hate perseverance battle logic , pride tolerance group soon start battling each other over what they think right wrong when it comes avenging death lawman . great western film 1971 , chato land offers solid stoic storyline wrought irony well themes loyalty revenge . charles bronson aside , superb supporting cast experienced well . victor french ( later " little house " " highway heaven " stardom ) graces screen one posse members , jack palance james whitmore tow , its well rounded cast never lacks quality acting despite somewhat linear storyline . palance plays part quincy whitmore , war veteran who understands , sometimes even respects apache actions more than most . his arch-nemesis jubal hooker ( played simon oakland ) who " fever " wanting see apache man hang , even if it costs them lives which could end up coming down last man . jubal excellently played oakland man who consumed his own destiny vengeance . loyalties loved lost , large part movie very emotional power prestige we experience dismay men they deal battles rage within their very own camp , minds . bronson portraying cunning , intelligent yes even ruthless apache warrior , chato land western filled buzzards drinking blood , dark side man , notion if you go battle someone their own back yard , you better think twice who best odds , regardless how many men you bring you . scenic landscape shots taken night well during scorching hot days excellent , sound quality this dvd my opinion very good if not perfect . if you want western gets dirty but portrays deep story within , see " chato land "	1

reform school girls over top woman prison cult classic fun fun fun watch . i watched this movie 100 times growing up mid 80 , it still pleases today . wendy o williams completely mesmerizing watch , although her acting pretty bad say least . still film manages entertain its completely unbelievable premise . i love this movie . pat ast wendy o williams make this movie what it , why sybil danning got dvd cover i'll never know ( she barely film ) . pat wendy ( both who since passed ) make great villains though , thoroughly enjoyable watch over over again . if you like low budget , entertaining prison films lots women , violence nudity , then you love reform school girls . soundtrack pretty awesome too , showcases . o . w real talent musician performer . check out dvd commentary ! it pretty funny entertaining listen !	1
i enjoyed my second viewing this movie ... it proves power robert duvall ... he play most parts if born them . anyone who fan williams faulkner should enjoy it .. but word warning .. it not those suffering depression	1
bruce willis would not first actor bag their own work . some people might take fact actor bags their own work very authoritative statement not bother seeing such film . if actor doesn't like their own film , why should anyone else bother ? but i think such need not always case , this movie one good example . artist always critical their own work , rightly so . but just because they see things they don't like their own work or something else film they , not mean others certainly see same things same reasons . after seeing trailer this movie dvd i , i came upon imdb post bob costas ' tv interview ( i've never seen it myself ) bruce willis saying he knew this movie crap when he making it , this experience made him decide choose projects based projects merits avoid hollywood tripe . this other reasons , i not bother pursue getting movie time . recently , i came across this movie wal-mart $5 discount bin bruce willis fan i grabbed it . after watching it , i find it easy say even though i don't care much movies involving serial killers , this decent enough flick would worth it i paid $10 instead . it could defined typical hollywood tripe , especially if you're actor who business years looking expand your horizons . but not all tripe truly tripe . bruce decent enough job going up against killer , movie not just tired boring numbers . it looks sounds good , good production values cinematography , fairly suspenseful entertaining . big picture it probably fairly typical this type movie , but if you want see bruce willis go through paces taking down serial killer routine , it decent interesting take it all without lot your face gore or anything . incidentally , i plenty others think hudson hawk rocks ! some people just don't get it i suppose	1
ok , i rounded up 4 stars . this really isn't bad , though . it idiom most american viewers won't familiar . major characters kuan yin , confucius , flock other gods , godlings , immortals , buddhas , figures myth , other well-known figures stereotypes chinese pantheon . there flying heroes , improbable weapons , acting least par dr. who series . other words , lots viewers see it alien , disconnected , amateurish , well filled overly convenient miracles . but it not western idiom , so parts it taken their own terms . it look low-budget film , so you won't see effects star wars scale . it bit cheesy over-the-top , which part appeal . fights bloodless , romance chaste , all but youngest kids understand characters . if you don't take it or yourself too seriously , there lot fun this one . //wiredweir	1
this one my all time favorite movies when im down dumps this movie makes me laugh . must own anyone loves bett	1

good movie , but not good first	1
i've watched video 4 or 5 times i come conclusion film one best early doris day films existence . dancing , singing cute story but few wonderful things film offer . supporting cast , especially s.z. sakall , who great viennese actor early 1930s , provides one best examples character acting movie musical history . florence bates anne triola , who teams billy dewolfe , excellent their roles , too . you would foolish pass this one up	1

growing up " coal miner daughter " ky myself i assure you this spot-on accurate . mining ky small town often only means successfully support your family . my father worked union mine after " company man " but even union strikes frightening often violent so much stake . we often shipped off town safety while my dad would guard house . this mid 70 well . i admire accurate depiction people this documentary . i expected them depicted sterotypical uneducated southern rednecks what i saw wise , passionate well-spoken ( albeit southern drawl ! ) women amazing fearless . would love see followup what happened town people 30+ years later	1
one best movies ever made woody . rare look complexities former communist world through antics us embassy invented country vulgaria . like great old cartoon , wonderful characters , especially leader local kgb , played vit horejs ! he hilarious , woody wife portrayed incomparable julie kavner . michael . fox stars bumbling son out office ambassador . great comedians all . documentary film style camera work . great !	1
uncle buck absolutely hilarious , no better actor then john candy play this role ! uncle buck slobby , unorganized , middle-aged man , asked his brother stay over his house , so he take care his 3 kids , while he his wife out town visiting her sick father . even though uncle buck seems like careless slob , we get see his paternal side we see how he actually really cares each these children . best scenes ones where he look after oldest child who rebellious teenage girl , also starring this film very young macaluay culkin gaby hoffman 2 younger children . this movie classic , i totally recommend it ! not mention it john hughes film .	1
i love this movie . this movie blue print all revenge horror movies we now . its slasher movie real characters . most slasher movies characters who over top whatever sterotype movie character , look like crew models lol . looks cast , i tell studio didnt tight cast call roles this movie . unlike most slasher movies , i didnt want whole cast die , even though sooner or later they would face their fate . even wendy pretty tame mean girl compared some other ***** newer slasher movies . they actually likeable kids , happened make one little mistake lol . ending sequence one best saddest i ever seen horror movie ever ( even inched passed " carrie " ) . main reason one songs " fade black " . listen words they actually follow story line . yes , soundtrack made this movie . every time you hear music it fits scene perfectly . i wonder what would happen if you dance number jamie your prom . lol i just wish it comes tv more . i just ordered dvd , i heard word remake this classic underway sometime coming up real soon .	1
this my favourite soundtrack/movie , course i would rate it highly !!! excellent quality , fast delivery , all round good service !	1

if you like skiing , women , hilarity , this movie you	1
i can't really say how much i love this movie . it obvious strength powerful moving performance jack nicholson . randy quaid also excellent . but script - lines reveal so much characters . writing strong enough novel , breadth expansive . i few favorite scenes , such bar scene restroom scene , but there one sticks my throat every time i see this film . various points picture , cheery march played soundtrack , obviously sarcastic counterpoint inglorious life enlisted man stuck unforgiving system . once three main characters go through their " lost weekend " young prisoner , they snowy portsmouth , only few precious hours before their charge must turned over brig . this time , nicholson character developed such fatherly attachment naive prisoner he grant him any last wish : even attempting burn frozen wood campground so three wieners . after they eat hot dogs , there slow panning shot pristine snow covered park , not soul sight . slow , mournful dirge plays soundtrack . it end line , fellas . party over it time face harsh realities . young charge gonna locked up eight years you two " mean [ ... ] " going right back into love it or hate it lifestyle where your freedoms few far . it slow pan , which ends shot jack nicholson sniffling bitter cold lamenting his hard-nosed partner , young man whose spirits he tried lift , get pummeled abused long chunk time . it fear any parent their sensitive child entering harshness world . if you patience , if you tell good acting bad i recommend this film you	1
pest just released regioun 4 . pest guy who scam artist who finds himself offered lot money german whacko ( jeffrey jones ) hunt him game . it filled comedy , whackyness over top humour , you could say it real life cartoon ways . john plays funny charactor named pestorio " pest " also mad tv aries spears plays his best friend bunch unknowns . overall movie some funny stuff it pretty underrated . i hope john didnt apologise it , he nothing apologise this film . bring return pest . ( part 2)the bonus features audio commentary ( zzzz ) badly biography read john producer . there also 5 minute featureete / behind scenes thing couple trailers . john actualy wrote opening song he singing it hillarious hear what he come up improv . it only cheapie , so it worth price . other wise rent it before dissmissing it , it highly underrated .	1
day , this interesting well filmed production . dvd quality allows great deal detail not seen televised versions , even if televised ones uncut . science 1950 . look george o'hanlon ( voice george jetson ) computer specialist .

family orented movie , good family movie night	1
this film , faithful horn autobiography , beautifully photographed . last gasp tribute vanished america ( both frontier west * * liberalism ' 60 ) it virtually flawless . mcqueen , like wayne , started what essentially westerns except his medium tv . his movie career , like wayne , econmpassed action roles several genres . his macho image , like wayne , often overshawdowed his acting , , finally , like wayne shootist , mcqueen ended this stunning performance . farnsworth excellent coble , evans true character glendolene myrtle kimmel , who horn great champion , pickens pickens . billy green bush portrayal us marshall joe belle sufficiently slimey central characters this tragedy , producers not find it prudent use actual name deputy us marshall joe lefors ' who bragged rest his life he " slickered tom horn " his exploits . i'd say it must see .	1
lee marvin chuck bronson both top-flight actors , their presence this movie only makes excellent ' chase ' plot much better . this one watched when desire see good action film hits again again it contains interesting nuances issues keep it getting ' old .	1
terrence malick acquired tremendous cult following auteur , but this , his first film , only truly successful one among them -- one finest films ever attempt capture donwside american dream ( it without pretentiousness ) . although many films inspired notorious 1950s killing spree charlie starkweather caril fugate , natural born killers frighteners , badlands really only one resonate -- part because it treats its starkweather-fugate analogues not quintessence gleeful evil but rather polite disaffected , making their killing spree all more astonishing . kit carruthers ( martin sheen ) handsome , well spoken , very gracious ; he chastises himself when he speaks ungrammatically records notes telling children very pietistic typical homilies playing fair listening minority opinions but acceding majority . he shoots father his girlfriend holly ( sissy spacek ) only when man threatens deny kit what he feels fairly his -- holly -- , thereafter he uses his gun means rid himself simply people who attempt arrest him . it becomes basically adolescent wish-fulfillment scenario . when kit holly escape forest build themselves elaborate treehouse , they become like swiss family robinson or huck joe raft escaping their pursuers . cinematography film widely praised , its extremely inventive use music ( carl orff " musica poetica " well songs mickey sylvia nat ' king ' cole ); sheen spacek could hardly improved upon central roles	1
i say i love this movie very well . but after all these years it release why ? it not put widescreen format or updated hd or blueray or new 2 disc dvd set laser dics version widescreen format someone needs get this out newer formats so we really injoy this movie ..	-1
this excellent movie warms your heart . very much like hallmark move but better . each character portrays their character wonderfully . it really touches life birth death	1
we saw this movie gym class it worest movie any one ever see	-1
i read some negative reviews here i just laughed how naive some people . they call this racist movie , it horrible , spike shouldn't make movies anymore . but if these people open their eyes , they realize all negative comments actions movie really happen . it true both sides black white . movie made expose how we people general expose ignorance different races each other . not only movie address race but it also addresses drug problems community well issues affect families . but i guess some people too narrow minded catch . anyway this classic spike lee film great cinematography , good script , awesome cast . definitely dvd your collectio	1
excellent combination comedy action . very interesting british version also . vinnie jones jason statham both wonderful actors this film . i've watched it many times watch it many times more	1
i first saw this film tv when i 10th grade , i my friends house it when i arrived , i asked him where h___ , it so beautiful . anyway this film really friendship more so than sex man two beautiful women . peter gallagher great actor , i wish he more films today , he should so called lists . anyway when i finally went crete santorini aug 1990 again 1991 it even more beautiful than i thought . so women . i would love see sequel years later same actors see how their lives turned out . there nothing sleezy this film all despite what others may say . great study friendships relationshipsi would highly recommend this film anyone	1
this series sold missing episodes , like many others here unbox . they think their customers so dumb ? would you buy dvd series missing dvd ? what sense this make ? what disappointment this service ..	-1
this show could lot worse . melissa sagemiller looks amazing dark hair freckles . i'm not sure how i feel this series but i watch entire season just finished second season where strongest hit last five minutes first episode second season ; maybe means this series compelling . if you don't agree how news represented perspective law enforcement terrorists , then you should still watch it know those perspectives . espousing may tedious but it never repetitive without point made . michael ealy would make dependable leading man superhero franchise . i see him batman beyond more than green lantern .	1
i loved this movie . i saw it when it first came out it such good feeling movie . i never forgot it i am so happy i now it my own .	1
this always one my alltime cinema favorites i happy see it available dvd . story , script , direction , acting superb .	1
excellent ; almost exciting sitting theatre during performance	1
there nothing attractive life crime portrayed this film , one its strongest suites . based actual events , it study criminal existence its most bleak --- hats off filmmakers cast pristine starkness it all . there certainly nothing romantic or cool these people who respect no one nothing . i viewed it because i like actors curious see what they'd material like this . sean bean villainy down fine art --- but note his villains aren't charming or any kind ad youth plug into . we don't want identify his bad guys , we just want them get their just deserts . ( bean all more treat when he heroic role sink his teeth into like sharpe , neil byrne , or boromir --- even his heroes flawed , which says something roles he chooses --- but he always intriguingly watchable . ) alex kingston , tom wilkinson , charlie creed-meyers all uncomfortably fine their respective roles abused wife , partner crime , hapless wheel-man . others termed this drama " gritty " , but i think it goes even farther --- it cautionary tale	1
those you who haven't seen any films late , great french director , francois truffaut , day night ( french title : la nuit americaine ) great introduction . this actually won academy award best foreign film , it evident why . day night really valentine francois truffaut love affair cinema . this great intriguing story ( sort film within film approach ) . ferrand ( played truffaut ) hardworking film director , trying line all his ducks row , film complete his movie , " je vous presente pamela . " often case , nothing going quite planned . starters , his beautiful lead , julie ( jacqueline bisset ) , recovering breakdown . her co-star ( jean pierre leaud ) completely unreliable , severine ( valentina cortese ) , aging actress , hitting bottle pretty hard during filming their picture . what more , all sorts other intrigues taking place members crew ( romantic otherwise ) . i love this shot because it almost seems like pseudo-documentary , well loving tribute blood , sweat tears go into making film . how great truffaut got front camera this piece . he really should it more often . this film equally funny touching i highly reccomend it .	1
koreans honor their greatest military hero this epic drama which takes place late 1500s . career tactics this admiral still studied u.s. naval academy , doubtless those other nations . screenplay based couple novels , so there some fiction , but life yi soon shin well documented , so there plenty fact supporting story . if you not familiar korean drama , it good keep mind this not hollywood product , but they very well special effects such considering non-hollywood budgets involved , it easy see past all enjoy tale told . it long series , but presents epic power , depth dimension well worth watching it unfold through each every episode . it would great also see kbs make other dramas available viewing through amazon , such " seoul 1945 " .	1
timothy dalton fan , i watch quot ; king whorequot ; just see new side my favourite actor , i completely drawn into it . there lot fighting it rather risque times , but plot memorable . i loved costumes scenery europe -- this period piece king who falls desperately love young married woman . she feels trapped because every single person she knows trusts blames her not agreeing serve her king -- becoming his mistress . it takes her own husband disbelieving she not yet gone king her succumb pressure , yet she never enjoys his presence all . war erupts france she becomes ill , because king love her , he cannot concentrate fighting war instead heals her himself . i won't give away ending , but it superb film excellent acting . i definitely recommend it , but caution everyone it deserves it ' ' rating	1
i love this movie . it good all ages . i am 9 years old i love this movie . this story , their group called " larry amazing animals " . animals group 2 dogs , cow , ferre t.t his movie inspired me circus called " circus kids " . part gave this movie only 4 stars , when clifford left his home . course he goes back birdwell island . if you you not like part where he leaves home , skip it	1
i've seen several spongebob cartoons enjoyed them ( i'm 39 ... ) my 9 year old daughter , but not seen this movie until recently . i give it 4 stars only because i enjoy traditional spongebob cartoons more than i movie . movie seemed bit scarey times ; both thematically visually , but it pg rating this reason . you get bombarded " goofy goober " song , but if you're watching it ... you probably don't mind . bikini-bottoms up	1
this movie i looking long time this excellent movie elvis i am really satisfied i recommend this movie all elvis fans .	1
based my perusal others ' reviews this movie , it seems some people expecting something monumental profound , hence disappointed . i don't know why they such lofty expectations ; " keeping faith " just one many ' romantic comedy ' genre . given this however , it most part enjoyable movie , if not entirely believable . heck ; reality itself unbelievable half time , so just suspend tendency hyperevaluate if you'd like appreciate this one . this my first introduction edward norton , i think he stand-out , both actor firs t-t ime director . dvd includes some deleted scenes , few which i'm very thankful deleted . movie could benefited some further editing well , but least worst bits scrapped . ben stiller jenna elfman don't much ' chemistry ' , efforts force fit would not served story well . there several veteran actors among supporting players , ann bancroft eli wallach among them , giving " keeping faith " bit boost . also enjoyable glimpses three leads ' characters ( norton , stiller , elfman ) adolescent friends . if you'd just like few laughs follies human beings nature their relationships , " keeping faith " well worth time investment .	1
there nothing special this movie . action ok , humor not especially funny , it sometimes slow . it delivers nothing new audiences	1

this interesting film , lot very artistic shots . instance one scene killer falls down dead , lands face face someone tied up floor , which makes some eerie yet comical artistic filmography . how melonie diaz , wow !!! melonie one hot little babe , prancing around her catholic schoolgirl pleated short skirt , owning film worth it , just watch her , what eye candy , what legs !!! anyhow leading man our comical hero , this film almost comedy , humorous look crime . future classic , should appeal those who not like commercial films , like art , jazz , finer things life ..	1
movie brought chechan conflict into perspective me . two russian soldiers , seasoned fighter sasha new trainee vanya , captured chechen soldier abdul . abdul hopes trade sasha vanya his son who imprisoned russian army . characters soldiers villagers develop , chechan russian soldiers come appreciate one . movie great . i am not into war movies but this movie actual story line great ending . i give movie a- .	1

scooby doo rocks ! this awesome episode , awesome way download some earlier episodes scooby . fun stuff , inexpensive download	1
sunshine doomed box office failure . three hour movie simply too long enjoy theater . it works much better dvd which turned off one so desires . still , i no hesitation giving it five stars . this film worthy your patience . we follow trails tribulations sonnenschein family hungary very beginnings twentieth century late 1980s . initially , this jewish family trying make best things citizens now extinct austro-hungarian empire . anti-semitism pervasive but jew , paying very high cost , permitted assimilate into larger christian community . what price tag required acceptance ? it abandonment one jewish religious cultural heritage . all three sonnenschein youths even opt forsake family name . things obviously not great . still , situation improving . then world war i breaks out their world collapses . one brothers foolishly seduced into embracing communism while other wisely understands viable society must committed rule law . present system might not perfect , but royal family benevolent willing continue relinquishing its power . regrettably , destruction caused great war eventually brings collapse empire . mid 1930s nazis rapidly dominating political landscape . adolph hitler could care less jew assimilation . only genetics matter jews deemed biologically evil . their planned eradication logical conclusion nonnegotiable ideological premises hitler thugs . even military heroes , olympic fencing champions , practicing catholics scheduled butchered . members sonnenschein family realize too late precariousness their situation . finally , communists take over . these totalitarians allege embrace universal brotherhood , radical egalitarianism , despise anti-semitism . this turns out , sadly , not entirely accurate . i amazed how honestly creators sunshine dealt jew hatred during stalin era . only jews tolerated soviets those self-hating variety . all others persecuted --- often point execution . sometimes even self-haters found themselves taking bullet back head . disgustingly , leftist intellectual establishment prefers ignore this vile chapter history communist movement . yes , you must see this movie . it should perhaps even placed top your list . david thomsonflares into darkness	1
perhaps only sculpture movie i ever saw . very french . she finally looses her mind end . much angst	1

" scrooge . i don't expect all my christmas films " happy happy joy joy " all time . my absolute favorite all time it wonderful life , which very dark places . first off , i don't think acting bad this movie . cinematography pretty good well . i made my judgment based content storyline , which , my opinion , flopped . what i really found annoying way ginny , heroine , constantly villified . example , let me paint you picture her life : her husband laid off hasn't worked six months . they two young children . she making minimum wage , they're barely scraping . they've also evicted their home ( since it owned her husband previous employer ) forced move her father-in-law . they very little saved bank , yet her husband wants take out $500 buy christmas presents kids . she understandably balks idea . first all $500 way too much spend presents just two kids , even if you're rich . unless you want your kids become spoiled ! ( remember , this movie originally made 1985 , so number even more outrageous . plus , they only one meager paycheck live no house their own . i think she reasonable . but she painted bad guy not blowing bunch their savings toys . then her husband wants sink what little money they into his own bike shop , possibly go into debt own his own business . again , she villified only responsible one , telling her husband he needs get steady job steady paycheck . after all , they may need their savings survive . this not time blowing it dreams may never pan out ( usually don't , since most small businesses fail first year ) . but no , she shown mean , cold-hearted witch saying this . grr . it just so irritating . yes , you want give your kids magical christmas , yes , husband always dreamed owning his own shop , but you responsible , especially when you children feed clothe . i don't think she scrooge wanting responsible adult ( she buy her kids resonably priced gifts , after all ) , but film painted her such . this film so depressing . it felt like world constantly kicking this family while it down . happy ending long time coming . also , i'd very hesitant show this movie impressionable young children . i certainly wouldn't want one my children think they constantly disobey me , run away home middle night , or talk creepy-looking strangers trench coats . that how kids end up abducted or killed ! not really realistic . i really expected better disney , especially when i really loved one their other christmas movies , santa clause . there way better christmas movies out there . see my list " christmas movies i watch every year " movies worth your time money . i don't recommend one magic christmas . if you're still determined watch it , try rent it first , or you might find yourself upset you wasted your money , like i .	-1

i love dark comedy more than next person , laugh things i probably really shouldn't . so i thought this movie , hyped very dark comedy , would right up my alley . sadly , apart few moments here there , " very bad things " simply fails comedy . it fails drama , because every single character unlikeable unsympathetic . that too bad , because actors fantastic their best material given them . i fault script , which problems best , direction editing , which give movie strangely languid character inopportune times . you could worse , but this strictly rental best .	-1

what i say ' richard pryor - live smokin'' ? first , big thank you filmmaker who insight document this amazing comic genius film . see beginnings man who would redefine comedy forever joy . sadly , there no film little richard his zenith concert 1956 ' 57 precious few concert clips early chuck berry . but here enshrined forever 1971 concert slightly nervous , possibly high possibly attempt kill nervousness ( not should excuse ) richard pryor trying out his then-untested material he worked diligently develop previous year berkeley , ca when he left his cosby-copying , highly paid jive career . this film shows him trying find his true comedic voice . one last thing -- pryor unafraid ' close room ' ( i believe that term ) i think it means not afraid go there ; make members audience walk out midway through performance . pryor fearless it showed his later work . he push it . he wouldn't richard pryor if he didn't	1
funny , only one other reviewer here noticed , or guts , state obvious : girl this movie obviously delusional need psychotherapy . but i digress ... alright , here truth this movie . always-great macy plays middle-aged college professor who offers help one his failing students , this case young woman clear psychological problems . student question blows simple misunderstanding into full blown sexual harassment charge aimed destroying professor , which turn would mean losing his hard-earned tenure . any normal woman would clearly seen misunderstanding what it : misunderstanding , consequently drop matter entirely . not so student-from-hell this film . she not only misconstrues professors intentions , she goes personal vendetta single-minded purpose shark hunting baby seal ( only shark more intelligent ) , whereas girl comes accross moron schizo-affective disorder . she tries completely utterly destroy man . just when you think it couldn't possibly get any better , things go bad worse . what happens next could only take place mind someone desperate need thorazine : she accuses professor raping her . you say ' nut case ' boys girls ? i enjoyed this movie only because macy , who my opinion one most underrated actors our times . however movie bit unrealistic most men would either walked away this girl completely , told one their peers it soon enough make others aware situation , or - this what most men would if it came same point it movie . hire lawyer !	1

this film painfully outdated -- it never good begin . i suppose you would call this " romantic thriller comedy . " it fails every one these fronts . thriller portion preposterous , nothing but convoluted story 60s tv show . it not particularly funny either -- oh , but it tries . romance portion probably comes across best , but this only because excellent actors leads . no , what " into night " going it quirky , unique premise it never delivers . landis seems more concerned jamming scenes pointless cameos in-jokes . this film , which could regarded underground classic , none substance garner such praise . it not receive it . " after hours " , which came out same year , vastly superior . best thing " into night " watching young , gorgeous , pre-catwoman michelle pfeiffer , some la landmarks since demolished ( ships diner ) -- original one-sheet poster very , very cool	-1

thus , quote film above , goes movie shark attack 3 . all negative feedback this film true . rather than go what stated well already , though , here what i believe most memorable lines make this film uber cliched : " you're extinct , f-er !

other reviewers said , leonard maltin absolutely wrong this film . comedy very tight well timed . dialogue wittiest any movie i've seen era . it tend little toward one-liners , but it doesn't matter because it fall-out-of-your-seat funny . ingrid bergman divine role you would never expected her . signs times ubiquitous -- references quot ; pill , quot ; quot ; hippies , quot ; quot ; squares , quot ; etc ., but comedy far dated . best aspect film its unconventional plot . romantic comedies highly predictable class -- this one keeps you guessing . puts even neil simon shame . highest recommendation	1
this film made 1978 behind scenes look world professional football remains sadly pertinent nfl today making meshing business world athletes sport its own . nick nolte plays aging aching receiver who heart play game football but lacks ability his mind controlled people who run game . nolte excellent he winches moans throughout film waiting his chance play but continuously undermined corrupt coaching staff owners his team . mack davis plays handsome texan quarterback who cares little mind control more good time . charles durning maalox drinking assistant coach who adds some comedic relief story , bo svenson who plays psychotic linebacker nothing but " kill " his heart . dabney coleman steve forest evil business brothers who treat their players like machines tossing them out whenever necessary without thought . finally g.d. spradlin excellent job head coach without much soul but plenty insight . story shows world filled parties , adultery , corruption drugs it engulfs football players searching fulfill their dreams stardom self-importance . one hit end it all one badly placed step change their world . order succeed long career game drugs used keep aging body going . while outside toke marijuana ends game ( shades ricky williams here ! ) . somehow it just doesn't make any sense . film great classic if you love football but actual game scenes high school football best . politics ...... aren't they everywhere ? watch stirring speech athlete heart delivered late great john matuszak .	1

this affecting movie . many those who loved played basball their teens , even if only fleetingly , question back their minds . could i make it baseball ? obviously , very few succeed quest make bigs . but lots us wondered . this movie actually two movies one . first , local team , no record success over past few years , starts off poorly . they make deal their coach ( played randy quaid ) if they win district championship , he -- who once labored vineyards minor league baseball before calling it quits -- would attend try out try attain his dream . needless say , things work out you would expec t.t hen , upon attending try out , coach throws harder than he ever his earlier minor league efforts . he goes mid-80 mph fastball when he younger 98 mph fastball well into his thirties . makes one wonder ? however , this movie based real life story ; real jim morris ( played quaid ) , indeed , got major leagues . lots emotional moments . baseball afficianados like this , even if it formulaic . others might not " get it , " although it affecting movie several levels ( father-morris son , husband-wife , morris father-son ) . all all , worth watching . lot fun	1

i enjoy watching teen movies because i'm ever so curious how director sees this particular age group misconceptions present his view much teens ' view things . this movie unlike most teen " romantic comedies " i've seen , not necessarily good way . first all , main characters unlikeable don't represent actual categories people real life : we good looking rebel who actually not so rebellious after all but then gets back his old ways ( stupid twist if you ask me ) , nerd who can't get any ( they picked worst possible guy play nerd ; he actually pretty good looking funny guy ... ) , nerdy girl who hasn't grown up yet ( ends up hooking up rebel but they break up ) , gay guy ( i no idea what his role this movie ) , aggressive victim child abuse (...) , freaky nympho tint lesbian ( what hell you thinking daniel waters ? ) finally rebel childhood best friend who falls love him rejected ( film focuses 5 minutes its total 88 this character ... i don't know why she even here , she no obvious role her situation doesn't reflect all real world ) . next up , i think director sexually obsessed or something . ok , i know sex important part teenager life but this movie lame 13 year old girls aching sex even lamer 19 year olds who nothing else better . if i wanted see hormonal imbalance , i would go watch discovery channel . there more important things life than sex , this " masterpiece " definitely doesn't illustrate them . characters ' thoughts actions limited camp itself director focuses too much useless stuff tries create stereotypes , but fails miserably . most teen movies moral side them , they teach audience certain values , unlike " happy campers " . this movie only taught me it so cool obsessed sex , it cool 12 year old girls think they're oh-so-hot women , only absolute best looking guys hook up ( not true real world ) more [ ... ] . also director makes completely ridiculous situations seem normal , such camp leader getting hit lightning then acting completely weird , counsellors buying 47203 boxes condoms ( there only so much sex you 40 days ... ) , whole " don't-touch-me todd " thing , so so forth . this movie isn't worth $2 i paid rent it . those who think this better than american pie series should go out more . american pie work art , this piece [ ... ]	-1

this review 2001 warner brothers dvd . it 1959 paris jazz saxophonist dale turner ( dexter gordon ) playing blue note club . his stage presence seems sedated he sits rather than stands holds sax rigidly through most set , but his music mesmerizing . his biggest fan , francis borler ( fran�ois cluzet ) isn't inside club , but outside rain , listening every note though his life depended it . struggling graphic artist , francis doesn't enough money inside club , but one night after turner leaves blue note , he bumps into francis asks frenchman if he'll buy him beer francis gladly accommodates turner even though it probably cost him all money he his name . later it becomes clear turner drinking problem all his close friends including his landlady try isolate him alcohol . film moves more great sessions inside club , but one night dale picked up public intoxication point francis takes role dale personal caretaker even cajoles turner into moving him his young daughter into their small apartment . close-knit friendship continues turner clean sober . near end film , turner goes back america francis tagging but francis ' visit short lived he decides return france . movie best jazz film i've seen , it works magic because main character real professional jazz musician not actor music live not piped . movie take place this small lounge paris , adds international appeal , warmth very personal connection this brilliant art form . wonderful movie , too much time devoted borler obsessive relationship turner . this could quintessential jazz film if it focused more turner relationship other musicians more discussions mechanics music . far , best off-stage scene movie when turner dinner attractive female singer whose longtime friend she reminds dale voice gratitude , " you one taught me listen bass not drums " turner quickly replies back , " you would figured it out 10 or 15 years anyway " . other thing makes this film so special intimacy nightclub time when jazz musicians seemed far more accessible . final scene movie many years later large stage amphitheater which commonplace today jazz concerts gives older jazz fans longing golden age bebop those small clubs special musicians who played like dale turner . this must-have dvd any serious jazz fan . dvd presentation film justice . color widescreen presentation immaculate most importantly stereo soundtrack sounds fantastic . movie : a-dvd quality :	1

last reviewer interpretation book involves narrow understanding profit motive " greed " no understanding property rights . ( same problem environmental movement today . ) ... someone truly driven profit ( once-ler ) motive would not cut down all his truffula trees , but rather would replant manage his truffula forests order continue his biggering ( growth ) into future . same time , habitat forest creatures continuously renewed ( dispelling this apparent dichotomy ) . lorax , there no clearly assigned property rights . thus , once-ler no incentive protect his own property . indeed , since no one owns surrounding property either , once-ler also allowed pollute , well . they no recourse sue him or exact compensation , so once-ler allowed spread cost his activities onto everyone else . this known economists social theorists tragedy commons ... lesson i'll teach my kids this book respect other property , nature , " common property " ends disaster	1

i've owned laserdisc this 1981 performance many years . i've tranferred it dvd so i could view it conveniently dvd changer because i'd lost hope it would ever appear commercially dvd . production brilliant great " victorian " touches ( terms time period they seem come ) act ii ; mechanical " contraptions " wonderful . production fantastic , it should , yet seems rooted late 1800 . it also rich , sensual royal opera production . young domingo baltsa their best . regarding other dvds opera : much one vaguely admire opera de lyon " some tales hoffman " , striving different ( very stark ) destroys opera me . 1978 paris opera production ok if rather provincial looking ( very simple sets ) . 1970 komische oper berlin production actually quite good lively , but it sung german . even if musical performances royal opera production only ok it would winner , but performances excellent . anyone who thinks they even little interest french opera should buy this	1

personality nazi brownshirt one heightened need acceptance . fred leuchter painted such many people , some who knew him(and i'm guessing knew better ) we may witnessing others who didn't . brownshirts insult , assault , rather than intellectually confront expose objections their popular ideas . maybe major lesson holocaust brownshirt mentality live any culture so long popular movement idea available them cling . so long need acceptance outweighs need competition ideas . there must someone hate brownshirt exist , so they may prove their allegiance group . maybe great contribution one give their group sincere dissent , dissent not equal disloyalty ... except nazi state . there great free press germany nazi times , so long free thought constrained within preset boundaries . " mr. death " not representation fred leuchter . fred leuchter representation fred leuchter . might i suggest not suggesting collection articles many same people this documentary . that not clarification , that reinforcement one idea . rather go find fred speak him . get his view . if you don't preformed agenda ( like van pelt or morris ) , you may get him respond like i . i found different fred(and much much different story ) than i given director morris others . question not whether german gas chambers used murder people , question whether someone allowed think contrary , or any other idea . , without his house firebombed , concerted effort ruin him financially take place , his reputation ruined , or any other stuff happen . if fred ordeal any indication , brownshirts alive well , but i don't think fred one them . one fact i would alter my previous post rabbi bauer support " no gas chambers " . bauer supported fred methods , not necessarily his conclusion . i tried vain contact bauer , where he differs fred . fred high regard rabbi bauer . polish forensic investigation(which came soon after fred's!) not come same conclusion fred , but essentially duplicate fred data collection methods results . there testimony nuremburg trials both inmates german staff homocidal gassings took place those camps germany . 1960 , physical chemical tests showed no gassings occured there . it took 16 years(1976 ) simon weisenthal admit no gassings took place those german concentration camps . former inmate auschwitz said no homocidal gassings took place there . but all this isn't say auschwitz gassings didn't occur , but rather simply say some may think they didn't occur they shouldn't condemned ... unless idea create enemy out sincere people like fred	-1

after first two pink panther films , both peter sellers blake edwards chose move other projects . mirisch company , however , wanted film , frank tom waldman , both whom edwards cohorts , came up new script . this story more keeping last few clouseau films which would come much later : focus entirely clouseau not so much characters situations around him . weight this film , therefore , falls entirely talented shoulders alan arkin . mr. arkin up task , his interpretation clouseau much different than sellers , one would expect . arkin clouseau just confident his abilities , but somewhat more human core . one point film he doubts his abilities just moment , but only moment . this clouseau also more genuinely attractive women than sellers clouseau , which makes some comedy not seen edwards/sellers films . inspector clouseau fine supporting cast , beautiful european locations , moves very quickly , if sometimes erratically . humor not fall-out-of-your-seat funny , but pleasant bouncy . arkin contributes interesting , dancer physicality clouseau , especially when trying sneak . enjoyable , if not indispensible , sidebar pink panther films . there no extras speak dvd . transfer original 2:35 aspect ratio , color excellent . there preview steve martin pink panther	1

it doesn't surprise me " phantom " failed box office . it lacked star power other films time , relied name recognition hero who isn't flashy batman , spiderman , or multitude other characters , , honestly , it wasn't summer blockbuster material . perhaps if it came out dead winter when most studios toss out their artsy flicks hoping oscar recognition , it would better . said , i admit " phantom " wonderful flick watch . granted , it doesn't flying heroes or webslingers , but it wonderful story it classic vein those old 1930 cliffhangers . billy zane game kit walker/phantom . he classic hollywood look him makes him perfect role . kristy swanson ( original buffy ) wonderful job diane palmer , damsel not-so-much-distress . catherine zeta jones , james remar , underrated cary-hiroyuki tagawa head up stellar supporting cast . real " treat " here , however , treat williams xander drax , evil mastermind behind all phantom problems this film . he completely over top , delivering smug lines like , " show me power ! " enough cinematic flair you can't help but love his devilish character . story involves search three skulls : one bronze , one jade , one gold , give their owner ultimate power . drax , power-hungry man he , hunt these three skulls . only things his way sang brotherhood , who responsible creating phantom many centuries ago , phantom himself . tale bounces lush jungles africa ( but actually australia backlots california ) mean streets 1930 new york city , then dreaded devil vortex . it full swashbuckling , gunplay , high adventure , few explosions . cinematography brilliant , capturing beauty australian locations it filmed . blues greens fill tv screen wonderfully , vibrant purple phantom suit supplies wonderful contrast deep greens browns jungles . overall , there isn't too much that offensive this flick youngsters . language get little bit strong younger lot , but if you let your kids watch recent recent pg-13 hero flicks , i'm sure they handle this one . there quite bit violence , including couple impalings , but all it way no worse than most other superhero films . i highly recommend this flick fans films like " shadow " " rocketeer , " well most other superhero flicks . it might take awhile get beyond very purple outfit our hero wears this flick , but it all played out great intentions nod classic cliffhangers long ago	1
this movie so well written directed . end little unrealistic , but hey that what hollywood brings	1

its take-no-prisoners approach filmmaking , andrei rublev reminds me francis ford coppola self-indulgent masterpiece , apocalypse now . tarkovsky film biography fifteenth century monk renowned his painted religious icons . rublev russia equivalent michelangelo , some works attributed him display formidable beauty which all more remarkable because they created during rude violent time . film told through series loosely linked episodes which rublev either central , peripheral or irrelevant action screen . film brilliance self-indulgence evident right opening sequence . man paddling canoe across river get away gang pursuers . when he reaches other side , he ties himself primitive hot air balloon takes off into sky . high above his tormentors , he experiences vertiginous joy . we too , thanks some truly innovative camera work . man exhilaration cut short when balloon loses air crashes into horse , killing him instantly . what this rublev not much , other than metaphorically - man tries soar above danger chaos this life , only crash back down into mud . he wanders various churches he commissioned paint , rublev sorely tried . he tempted lubricious pagan women , nearly dies during sack vladimir ( horrific mesmerizing bit filmmaking ) loses half-wit girl he trying protect band roving tartars . when he afflicted , rublev retreats into scriptures . his real triumph not his art , but he managed hold spirituality made his art possible . like calm vermeer created during period religious political turbulence europe , rublev faith becomes triumph over reality rather than retreat i t.t arkovsky use lingering long shots combined abrupt cuts chapters give movie static , yet elliptical feel . it creates odd narrative rhythm , but it not dissimilar viewing great icon , which both stillness sense underlying mystery , which mystery attaches faith . end , whole andrei rublev greater than sum its fascinating but disjunctive parts . its various episodes bear witness heroic effort required make art during nasty brutish era - not unlike tarkovsy efforts bring his idiosyncratic vision screen under totalitarian regime committed social realism . patient this movie , let it lead you where it , you amply rewarded	1

director robert aldrich " kiss me deadly " offbeat production based mickey spillane novel which 1955 came tail end film noir era . film juxtaposition dark moody noir genre embryonic atomic age . ralph meeker playing narcissistic , unscrupulous private investigator spillane anti-hero mike hammer becomes involved plot beyond his normal scope . hammer who generates most his business through divorce inquests , uses both charms his sexy assistant velda played maxine cooper his own embellish his cases . hammer tooling deserted highway his signature sports car when he almost runs over young cloris leachman clad only trenchcoat little else . he stops pick her up soon learns she escaped asylum . driving together they forced off road abducted gang lead faceless heavy recognizable only pair fancy shoes . leachman who reveals some mysterious secrets hammer previous conversation , tortured death . she then placed hammer his car they pushed off cliff . hammer survives ordeal but gets idea he stumbled into scheme potential immense financial rewards . using his investigative talents utilizing array associates such auto mechanic nick , played nick dennis cooper , hammer comes into contact wide variety sketchy villains including leachman roommate lily played gaby rodgers . we finally learn prize bad guys after contained within well insulated black case apparently contains some radioactive material . tastefully shoed head gang revealed albert dekker playing arcane dr. soberin who cohoots gaby rodgers . wild memorable finale bullets flying dekker beach house hammer wounded , rodgers warned not open case . scene reminiscent pandora box , her curiousity gets best her after shooting dekker , opens case creating unexpected fiery cataclysm	1
three years after first mortal kombat film , fans couldn't wait annihilation come out . unfortunately , sequel not well box office after viewing it , i see why . first , i start what positive movie . kitana more role jax , i preferred sandra hess sonya little over bridget wilson even though she good job sonya character first movie , some fight scenes ( jax vs . cyrax , sonya vs . mileena , liu kang vs . baraka , sub-zero vs . scorpion ) sequenced good , dvd bonus features nice , soundtrack awesome . these positive aspects , however , could not save overall film disappointment . so what went wrong ? like first mk , annihilation attempted blend two mortal kombat games into one movie ( mortal kombat 3 ultimate mortal kombat 3 ) . unlike first mk , however , blend not successful . too many characters put into movie therefore character development most them almost non-existent . aside , only three actors my knowledge returned previous movie though it understandable why other actors not return . what else went wrong this sequel ? some acting either over-the-top and/or downright pitiful . shao kahn character raiden character poorly resembled . also , some characters didn't even get much screen time all . one flaw immediately noticed beginning movie one main characters gets killed off ( i won't say who because it probably obvious ) . while some fight sequences good , most them rushed some just flat-out ridiculous . this goes double animality sequence . sadly , mk annihilation doesn't rank up first one . despite all this , there some good news . after eight long years waiting , third mortal kombat film hit big screen most actors returning first movie . plus , third installment not only kontinue where first left off but also ignore events annihilation	-1

i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1

( when bobby asks may not difficult , she stiffens asks , " why shouldn't i difficult ? " ) but then may meets darren ( daniel craig ) , paula sexy , moody boyfriend man half may age , then all expectations fly straight out window land crash . i wish publicity film didn't reveal what happens may darren , but even so impact it assaults audience like punch face paula eventually gives may . if movie just elderly woman sexuality , it wouldn't so shocking ; what shocks may selfish betrayal paula , brutal fashion which paula discovers it . moment we lose all our moorings audience , no idea who among characters side , if anyone . we still sympathy may -- we don't patently hateful paula , darren bobby -- but we also gasp horror her heedless behavior , get idea why her children turned out way they .

this movie really showcases extreme dorkiness early 80s . but it really no one fault , they didn't know they dorks back then , that just way everyone acted before michael jackson came . clarence beeks ( breakfast club guy ) turns his usual mcgruff crime dog performance . nice appearance tom hanks too ; his 2nd best performance , very closely behind saving private ryan , which i would recommend watching immediately after seeing this movie . they go well together . oh well , least this movie gave police squad ! idea how open up their show . it still better than hercules new york , although very much , no	-1

documentary film maker , kenneth carlson , succeeds building his comedy manners toward dramatic conclusion . this documentary comedy sense " go tigers " happy ending , main characters ' situations life improve throughout film film generally sunny though there dark undercurrents life city massillon , ohio . " go tigers " not game football , it effect game small town . massillon barely city its ~ 30,000 people maintain high school football stadium 15,000 + people professional quality field sports plant . massillon high school football factory film follows three players selected family members through undefeated season . there some fantastic sequences football overshadow current u play because these boys so consistently good . game sequences gloss over details play , showing over top fans , band , parents central characters , cutting out fantastic plays . why i say it not " " football because , while score board play boards shown there minimal coverage rules , technique , field position or strategy . locker room half time pep talks given center stage . locker room scenes feature pointless rants strings obscenity players interspersed level headed coaching inspirational sermons all massillon denominations . team always comes out energized this motivation . massillon not wealthy city , so theme " where money come " ? choices made citizens plot thread runs through lives three players their families . you'll need see film if you want know more . i say , strength conditioning coach awesome , professional caliber athlete . there all too brief walk part opposing team mascots who fall down laughing funny . film covers town darkness , but not great deal emphasis . example , live tiger cub mascot mauls small child front his mother . film maker not blatant subtle points made massillon . my one criticism " go tigers " this film 20 minutes too long . it lingers over several football games way too much detail , but same time not enough . games covered superficial way without enough reference play make games interesting . excited fans don't move plot forward you see them over over over ....	1

i guess there must something profoundly wrong me , because i rather liked " maniac " . sure , i'll concede its definately not everyone , but what ? old cliche goes , one man trash man treasure . so , what i like maniac ? 1 ) while marketed slasher film , it utilized none stock slasher film cliches so prevalent time . namely , " all sluts die but virgin gets away " faux morality friday 13th halloween . 2 ) killer not super human killing machine like jason or freddy . rather , this character real . not literal sense , but its easy believe killer like this could exist . " maniac " much character study it horror film . joe spinnel gives outstanding performance " frank " , schizophrenic serial killer . he three dimensional character , film told entirely his point view . you see film , he not pure evil . he clearly trying stop , but he can't . i actually felt pity him . 3 ) i impressed more than competant direction cinematography . film shot very realistic , almost documentary style . performances natural believable . musical score excellent well . this film textbook example what achieved low budget some imagination skill . 4 ) i won't hypocrite . i'll admit it . i enjoyed this film visceral level . while pretty tame today standards , gore effects expertly executed always brilliant tom savini . if this makes me " sick person " , then i'm no more demented than millions fans who line up see " silence lambs " , " scarface " , hundreds other " visceral " films . i'm no more sick than millions people who spend hours day playing " grand theft auto " . point its movie . no one ever got hurt watching movie , or playing video game , matter . if watching " maniac " all it takes send you over edge , you probably pretty screwed up begin . isn't there enough real horrors world get upset ??? so , those who found film so offensive they would condemn everyone who doesn't share their phony moral indignation , why you bother watch film all way end ? weren't you sufficiently outraged halfway through film ? , without giving away too much ending , it not " stupid " some charged . frank clearly hallucinating . since film told his point view , audience could " see " his hallucinations . his wounds purely self-inflicted . once again , director choose original rather than fall back old textbook cliches , which this case would final showdown which caroline munro kills him . highly underratted , unfairly bashed dismissed critics , " maniac " achieves what it aspires ; very original very imaginative horror film great performance joe spinnel . fans " good " low budget horror films likes george romero wes craven , this essential viewing , which why they play it fairly regularly ifc . i'll take this film over " final destination 1 , 2 , 3 " , or similar formulatic crap masquerading horror films any day week	1
i can't understand good reviews given others this movie . frankly , i thought it dog . not say it no redeeming features - friendship young girl lawn man endearing , if improbable . girl herself real sweetie , good actress - perfect part . fact , acting all around admirable . but script ! yikes ! not single character whole movie - partial exceptions two protagonists - any motivation anything they . people acting awkward or mean ( fact , just everyone movie other than said two mean ) , or spiteful , or stupid , no reason all ! it seems though somehow , movie could good , but didn't make it . call it almost watchable . i came away lawn dogs ( yawn dogs ? ) feeling not all enriched . puzzled , perhaps , why anyone would make such movie . well , there admirable , unlikely friendship . but all . pass this one	-1

it hard impossible believe george cukor 1954 musical remake star born ever box-office failure or considered anything less than perfect movie . opening hollywood premiere scene similar one begins singin ' rain , star born quickly proves itself brilliant expose cruelty greed hollywood " star " system . now-famous plotline , alcoholic movie actor norman maine ( james mason ) " discovers " aspiring singing star esther blodgett ( judy garland ) , takes chance her talent ( she " little something extra , " he says ) , gets her screen test film contract . she slowly but surely becomes star , while norman " star " falls due his drinking . they marry , but even esther love cannot save norman ultimate self-destruction . this plot summary suggests " show-within-a-show " -type musical , fact star born sometimes presents us show-within-a-show-within-a-show ( we watch esther watching herself big screen , her movie she plays performer ) - conceit gives film disoriented quality , even norman himself unable distinguish illusion reality . one could almost call star born musical people who normally dislike musicals : its drama - particularly norman personal drama - shakespearean stature , all its musical numbers either " onstage " variety or " one character [ esther ] singing entertain character [ norman ] " variety ; there , other words , no artifice would odds realistic drama . moreover , judy garland singing so inspired disarm any criticism . " man got away , " song first attracts norman esther , classic sequence , garland hummed notes beginning way brass matches power her voice song climaxes . garland other great numbers , too ( all , except those comprising " born trunk " sequence , written team harold arlen ira gershwin ) , including " lose long face , " " it new world , " " here what i'm here , " song symbolic esther willingness sacrifice everything care her husband . while judy performance great , james mason greatness itself . his brilliance norman maine lies fact he never allows this tortured man seem merely pathetic others ; even he plans his own suicide , he puts good face situation help his good looks uniquely english wit charm . movie villain norman press agent ( jack carson , actor not known playing villains ) , who out jealousy spite undermines norman courageous effort stop drinking , making him believe he never anything better than drunk . charles bickford well-meaning studio head , whose flaw he too cautious conventional his attempts help norman . clocking three hours ( even freeze-frame device telescoping some action ) , star born strange film , combination backstage musical , hollywood expose , love story , tragedy , inspirational story . it wasn't fully understood or appreciated when it first appeared perhaps understandable after all , but it should no longer neglected .	1

first flash white this movie runny droppings falling pigeon onto overcoat karol karol ( zbigniew zamachowiski ) he enters parisian courthouse . next time we distinctly see white , it porcelain toilet into which karol vomitting . these two scenes occuring so early , you know white , this film , represents not purity , but pure cra- . however , if true color , it definitely not true movie , which pure gold . white , three-colored french flag , represents equality , " white " kieslowski second film " three colors " trilogy -- " blue " ( liberty ) first , " red " ( fraternity ) third . it our polish protaginist karol karol ( redundancy , duplicate , even name ) who brings up issue equality " julie " " blue " appears briefly rear court where karol french wife dominique ( julie delpy ) divorcing him his inability consummate their marriage -- wedding night or since . karol relatively short man boyishly charming face , which , alternately smiling yearning , carries us through movie . dominique ( french , " dominer " means " dominate " ) blonde , taller than karol , says she no longer loves him , although , strange conversation him " understanding , " she says , " you don't understand i want you , i need you . . . " he implores her come him poland , but she refuses . rest movie may " understood " his attempt get her come . . . poland . i think this , rather than revenge , his real motive . entire movie , word " revenge " used only once , lips dominique conversation " understanding , " where we all understand he not interested revenge . instead , he tells stranger he still loves dominique . when karol returns warsaw , poland ( kieslowski birthplace ) , his first view city dump .

la bete humaine my favorite renoir one which tends divide many his critics admirers . me it exhilarating involving piece cinema characters destroyed destroying themselves events much more credible circumstances than regle du jeu , which gives it some real emotional thematic weight beyond mere parlor games - not mention thrill seeing post ww1 french doomed romanticism evolving into proto-film noir before your very eyes . these characters truly all their reasons find their attempts control events other people backfiring spectacularly they lose control way none mannequins regle . but it all subjective . jean gabin superb , use locations exemplary simone simon babe , even if she try bite	1

unbelievable ! i bought both cd soundtrack , dvd this inconcievably brilliant musical collaboration automatically hooked . i've never seen any other les miserables performances stage . i admit i watched movie starring liam neeson . but when i watched this concert , i immediately biased . colm wilkinson such heartwarming yet awe inspiring way bringing jean valjean life . fact his age he could still hit those higher notes just testament him dream cast . ruthie henshall . fantine mother little cosette played hannah chick . never before i seen more perfect merging character performer . when she sang i dreamed dream , you could feel see every emotion coming forth . you could believe what she going through , she deserved her spot dream cast . judy kuhn . older cosette . before pocahontas , judy kuhn made cosette her own . she made it quite seen she enjoyed her role she feeling love marius who played michael ball . micheal ball brilliant vocalist he , testament his role spot cast . phillip quast javere . character i felt so many emotions . hatred , understanding , pity , respect . he definately character ages . quast so tear jerking javere , especially when his character commits suicide . i truly feel sorry quast character , i also respected his determination once he performed song stars . lea salonga eponine . disney veteran(aladdin ) , her performance my own deserved outstanding ovation she recieved . she tender , she honorable , she made it quite easy audience sympathetic her cause strife . other very honorable mentions include adam searles who played gavroche , michael maguire who portrayed enjorlas , alun armstrong who played innkeeper course hannah chick whom i mentioned earlier portrayed younger cosette . best performances my opinion ensemble performing song one day more during end act 1 , michael maguire performance you hear people sing , epilogue performance end act 2 , one performance i didn't expect mention , michael ball performance song empty chairs empty tables . keep eye dvd gathering every valjean performances around world performing colm wilkinson multi lingual version you hear people sing , then belting out rest ensemble powerful encore chorus one day more . you hear people sing ? well if you buy this dvd les miserables , i garauntee you more	1

i don't care if it sexist dated ( , okay ... it ) , i'm giving 1967 " guide married man " politically incorrect 5 stars anyway because i love this zany comedy classic ! i agree reviewer manuel hernandez -- they absolutely don't make movies like this anymore because they can't: there simply no modern equivalent legendary likes jack benny , phil silvers , art carney , lucy ball , carl reiner , sid caesar , louis nye , terry-thomas or , matter , stars walter matthau robert morse . ( witness inept results ill-considered attempt remake stanley kramer 1963 masterpiece " it mad , mad , mad , mad world " ... ) after heard it years , i finally saw " guide " very first time cable movie channel 1993 enjoyed it zingy start satirically sentimental finish . ( any ideas where i find snappy title theme turtles ? ) walter matthau treat uncharacteristic role wide-eyed suburban everyman tutored whys wherefores adultery smarmy neighbor robert morse . ( you might want bookend this movie stingingly funny " corporate " musical " how succeed business without really trying , " also starring talented morse released same year " guide . " ) special nod , too , beautiful ( tragic ) inger stevens ( " farmer daughter " ) matthau sweetly trusting housewife . space won't allow me detail all marvelous guest spots featuring a-list cast , so just rent , borrow or buy this very funny movie see it all yourself . sure not miss reiner comic pursuit stunning " miss stardust " !	1
i watched battlefield earth because it just went into rotation cable movie channel i see if rumors true . i made it end , waiting hoping all while some redemption would make it worth trip . sadly never came , credits rolled i chose fall line everyone else who says this movie unqualified disaster . fairness travolta ( though he hardly blameless ) , . ron hubbard story main culprit , horribly conceived best considered failure many misguided loon . said , those who follow crazy people don't deserve much more respect . if travolta wished venerate his fearless leader , least he could attempt turn hubbard semi-fictional paranoia into something least marginally entertaining . artistic license would gone long way toward saving this mess . instead , story became mockery itself , leaving this production sad effort otherwise very talented actors	-1

" children corn " some potential : " corn " cult children charismatic adolescent its leader takes over rural town nebraska . based short story stephen king , this fairly interesting unusual concept . unfortunately , some very weak execution what mars movie . its director , fritz kiersch , sometimes works " alan smithee , " pseudonym directors who don't want attach their real names movies they know turkeys . this movie doesn't quite warrant , though it isn't very good either . there scarcely anything more pathetic than movie claims frightening , yet simply not . most egregious use hokey , faux sacred music . aside linda hamilton , john franklin robbie kiger , performances pretty weak . it doesn't help some dialogue laughably bad some special effects cheap look awful . isaac chroner ( franklin ) instructs children town murder all but one adult , who apparently needed warn potential visitors against entering town . his advice nearly prevents vicky burt stanton seeking medical help there , but darker forces prevail couple finds itself fending off attacks kids . if excessively dramatic acting cheesy effects climax not make you laugh , incredibly lame final scene certainly . not say this movie all bad , however . though never scary , there few effective moments throughout . ( i don't want reveal any them because they would only reasons watching movie ) die hard horror fans might want check out this 1984 release , though fans good movies probably want steer clear . this anchor bay dvd anamorphic widescreen good picture sound , though this not director cut .	-1
