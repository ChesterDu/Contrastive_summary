i owned palm organizers since days original palm pilot loved them ( i think i three different models over years ) . i wanted smart phone so i could check my email so i gravitated treo 680 so i could stay palm product so i could stay my current mobile provider , cingular . now i am counting days until my 2 year commitment ends so i punt this awful , awful product . i may even bite bullet pay off my commitment early just so i get rid i t.t he battery problem huge . you must remember stick this charger whenever you . if you forget leave it your pocket overnight then it dead next day . i turned off every thing i find sucks power it still drains amazingly fast . it won't even last day if you make very many calls . reception terrible . i've cingular phone long time able get good reception over most so . california ( except my house course ) . this phone i think you right underneath antenna get signal . i conference call yesterday got dropped twice . i am envious everytime i get elevator someone who talk their cell phone because mine freeze up any time i try . yes , it freezes up often . only way i found unfreeze it take out battery let it hard reboo t.t he versa mail program it came cingular hard work . you must leave your work computer check corporate mail . means if i am traveling my computer , phone corporate mail program not work . it often not sync anyway . i don't think browser comes phone work java , so i cannot check my yahoo mail either . i tried going back forth pre-java version yahoo too much pain . i get all kinds weird messages phone . i haven't ever able sync up palm features because some legacy files my previus palm software , something never happened when i upgraded before . yes , there manual huge . it hard use line so i guess i need bite bullet print out whole thing then take week vacation read it see if i make any these neat functions i read work . hardly week goes i don't actively think how much i hate this phone . i actually signed amazon today just write this because phone wasn't working properly today . what piece junk !	-1
so i bought this thing based amazon reviews saved bundle over local retail cost ( yeah amazon ! ) , but that not why i'm writing this review . i'd like talk performance comfort earboom . eargel thingies designed quite well , three different sizes each ear you're bound find one fits very comfortably . turns out i couldn't find any fit my right ear comfortably extended periods use but found perfect fit my mate other side . my wife exact opposite experience - hopefully our daughter inherit more symmetrical ears ! i hate jogging so can't comment fit during activity but say gels fit suprising well folds your ear boom quite secure when installed . i'd imagine it'd take big hit knock it loose once place . sound quality earbud decent , but i feel earboom lacks some fidelity , especially higher frequencies . normally this not problem , but it sometimes make person you're talking sound like isaac hayes . speaker plently loud lack high frequencies allows you tune into tonal range where us humans tend converse , without voices washed over background noise . gels block appropriate amount external sounds allowing you concentrate discussion hand without impeding your ability hear say ambulance while driving . there small slot gels funnels some external noise your drum , while rest gel fits snug ear blocking out other stray noise paths . i've asked people how i sound thus far feedback positive , my voice comes through loud clear despite boom apparent lack length , reinforcing my belief size doesn't matter . fact , i found mic very sensitive even small sounds . forget talking phone subtly typing keyboard our mouse click surfing - they'll hear every click . example , i my house person other end could hear kids playing pool 40 feet away house windows closed !! yes , mic sensitive . even while driving they could hear when i shifted gears . not it obtrusive other person phone , it just good aware they hear it all . what more say such simple device . form fit function all there i would recommend this product . fact , i just ordered - it makes great gift	-1
every new gadget imaginable i must report i love this phone because i take pictures make videos ! i loathe charge battery everyday ! perhaps i just got bad battery but i've never charge any phone daily . keep mind i leave my phone 24/7 . maybe i should turn it off . anyone else this same syndrome ? if you're shutterbug like me , you love this phone . i didn't even mention hot pink/magenta color which all gals love . one note caution , if you live hurricane alley like me , you may want carry spare battery just case they don't take down cell phone towers before storm . it may useless locally but you least tell your people you're still among living need money escape carnage	-1
protective skin bit too thick some applications ( gps car holder ) , but what designed . solid grip , non-slip . would nice if it not so thick	-1
i just purchased this phone four days ago impressed it most part . first thing you'll notice how crisp clear screen . this slider phone , thankfully you most things without sliding screen expose number keys . only things i think thus far requires you expose keys dial new number that not your contacts text message . next , we go features . so we got 1.3 mp camera , camcorder , music player , 1gb microsd card , bluetooth support , infrared port .. * drumroll please * fm radio . now , fm radio isn't satellite based , so you cannot pick up radio stations across u.s. , just those stations local you . now i go into good bad things each feature : 1 . camera - impressive picture quality . yes it only 1.3 mp compared those 8mp digital cameras , but you show me camera what this phone ? 5/52 . camcorder - not all impressive . while you recording , quality seems perfect . however , once you play it , it turns bit distorted . plus , it only allows 20 seconds recording time regardless size your microsd card . 3/53 . music player - impressive . speaker good quality , very loud . however , i still could not find way change order songs without making playlist . there play , pause , next song , previous song , fast forward , rewind features buttons shown pictures . buttons must pressed fairly hard , so your music won't start playing spontaneously your pocket . also , i blown away how quality music improves once you put those stock earbuds . 4/54 . fm radio - i bet those this phone tried use radio but stopped short told you buy enhancement . well , truth you don't need buy anything extra . just plug earbuds came phone , this serve ' antenna ' allow you hear stations . since you need earbuds hear radio , yes sound go earbuds . however , there ' loudspeaker ' option allows radio played through external speaker , but you still need keep earbuds plugged , it serves ' antenna ' . this means if you want hear radio your phone , you need earbuds you . you may need play around position phone antenna ( or you may move ) order get clear reception . 3/5misc . info : only two games included , both trials . ( lumines , texas hold'em)you can't transfer games phone . you must pay download them again . you can't delete pre-created profiles ( those come phone ) . you just create your own . order change phone vibrate , you must make vibrating profile . then use it , it takes several steps , which not hard , but inconvenient . interface shows month date , but not day week . only two face templates included phone . that all now . overall : 4/	-1

this phone also sold dopod 838 pro asia ( it quite popular singapore ) , htc tytn europe , but unlocked model . quite bit more expensive than what cingular sells it here . if you using this your first pda phone non windows product , you think it heavy , over feature laden product you never fully use , its problematic one . said , this probably one best windows pda phones available today . features this phone ( 3.5 , bluetooth 2.0 , etc . ) such you would never need bring laptop you . you even install skype mobile this phone . keyboard stows away well , good feel . there initial problems this phone asian market , now since resolved , now robust reliable . but one caveat keep mind when using this product ... it runs windows mobile . meaning , if you not familiar windows devices , it may frustrate you ... it doesn't respond like non windows cell phone . but , if you overlook , it perform better than anything available ... even blackberry devices not compare this	1

pros : fits phone very snuggly . made interesting flexible material fells like rubbery neoprene like polymer . all buttons phone accessible through case . belt clip sturdy removable so you wear phone your belt easily remove reinstall it belt clip without taking belt clip off your waist . cons : you cannot access keyboard without removing phone case . clear plastic screen covers phone screen little far surface phone screen . this makes it more difficult press buttons phone screen stylus near corners screen . clear plastic screen protector may stretch use make this easier but i'm not sure . positive side , you easily cut out clear plastic screen still use case some extra stick screen protectors found online .	-1
i've 3 cell phones prior this one , all motorola i really thought they all pretty good phones ... however i recently just made switch my new se k790a this one blows them all out water ! it very compact durable you tell it made incredible level quality control . i don't think i'll ever go back motorola . camera great feature . this why i bought phone , now i am never without camera . flash good strong , so it takes great pictures good focus . i don't really use mp3 feature because i ipod . i not comment this feature . however i very disappointed it wouldn't allow me use mp3s ringtones . i heard this because my service provider jackass not phone fault though . little bit forum browsing i able hack my way around this ( if you this problem email me skibum2801@yahoo.com ) ... now i my very own custom ringtones come out clear day nice speaker . call clarity much better than my other phones . i feel if i'm simply using my home phone it so grea t.t he screen resolution absolutely beautiful . buttons took little bit get used ( because i motorola girl so long ) but i picked it up quickly now i no issues .
