this pedometer so much cheaper ( ~ $7 ) than typical decent ones ( go $18 - $20 ) .. now i know it reason .. buttons flimsy , package looks very cheap , one i bought presented senior citizen - not work , also found sr citizen found it very hard use buttons this little device .. terrible ergonomics/form factor . would recommend spending bit more getting omron/oregon sc $18 pedometers - much better form factor , high reliability quality	-1

i'm more than satisfied this scale . i concerned i would buy more expensive scale get good accuracy ( see reviews other digital scales this price range , ) but i've tested it several times over several days , my weight varies 2 pounds or less over course day . my first weigh-in day pretty much same previous mornings , sadly . neutral color ( grey ) glass would blend well just any decor , lcd screen easy read , 1.5 inch high numbers . only thing i don't like it it creaks quite lot when i step it , even though i'm nowhere near its 330 pound maximum load . problem my head more than scale : i don't think it going break , but it sounds like i've got two people standing it once--i'm not fat , am i ? added feature when i'm craving , i go into bathroom look it , know it isn't going fall any my excuses tomorrow morning . so last piece cake still sits fridge . scale intimidated me into not eating it . accurate , easy read , easy eyes , intimidating -- i think it good deal	-1

over years , i tried many different brands types heated rollers i never liked using any them . i recently bought new set which i return due fact i terrible time trying roll my hair almost smooth surface rollers then after clipping rolls , they would immediately fall out my hair .... scream ! i bought remmington #1080n wax core roller set i finally found easiest quickest way curl my hair . rollers surface , when warm , grab hair ends immediately allow great control when trying roll even short hair . rollers held place full clip which looks more like comb so clips not leave ridge my hair . once heated , rollers relatively cool touch ( no more burned fingers ) but due wax core , rollers hold plenty heat it takes just few minutes after setting produce excellent , long lasting results . set takes 10 - 15 minutes warm up . i've found warm up time takes longer than time i actually leave curlers my hair . this best curler set i ever used . if i ask one change , it would quicker warm up time . however , just fact rolling so quick easy , makes up few extra minutes preparation . i'm hard please , so my recommendation says alot . thanks remmington ( i still don't like your other regular rollers ! ha )	1

i drink lot bottled water . it not make me feel full - sometimes quite opposite . course , drinking water before or during meal lessens chance overeating , but effect skinny water goes beyond . i love its taste because it not overbearing too sweet like other citrus-flavored water i've tried . it replaces my soda curbes my apetite pretty well . i also bought bottle friend mine . he wondering why he wasn't getting hungry long time , only later realized it must skinny water . it costs quite bit . however , bunch drinks cost same negative impact your body . so , even if this placebo effect ( , fankly , i don't care long it works ) , i think it worth it . you'll judge yourself . i can't afford three bottles day , but buy this water sporadically , most likely my local 7-11 . i would like point out most people who wrote negative reviews here either didn't like taste water , or never tasted it first place . course some people don't like taste - you can't please everybody - but it bears no relevance its efectiveness ! people who review stuff without trying it ... well ... they obviously don't understand what review means , too bad their preconceptions count towards overall score product	1
i little skeptical when i first bought bodygroom , but i say it definitely worth money . first time i used it , it extremely comfortable easy , areas i shaved ended up almost smooth if i used razor . it easy clean recharges quickly . only drawback it doesn't work well after you've used it while . i'm not sure if it because blades dull quickly or if it just normal wear tear , but you just little more careful because it easier nick yourself when it worn little . overall , however , bodygroom great tool trimming keeping groin , chest , underarm areas smooth	-1

yes scott most popular bathroom tissue since time began -- but " bounty " bathroom tissue : but this std . form little roughthis " scott bathroom tissue " strong , very long lasting , terrific value . there , however , one rub -- it little rough this application , especially frequent usage [ which why they recently introduced " scott extra soft " product ] . " charmin ultra " would better choice if you need extra softness some store brands such kroger , shop-rite , wal-mart " great value " comparable value-specific picks . scott always considered " gold standard " bathroom , but its superiority challenged increasingly recent years . if you still like this product , there no reason change . however if your needs now require softer tissue , try " scott extra soft " or " charmin ultra " . i recently noticed other reviewers , glued end paper roll must pulled apart order start roll seems very hard detach . this seems new phenomenon leads me believe things changed scott not better . maybe it just fluke . maybe it no big deal . maybe scott bathroom tissue isn't quite good it used . maybe it rougher coarser than before . just maybe . meantime , however , i am now using " charmin ultra " after 40 years continuous scott patronage .

this well-blended , complex , layered fragrance . it quite heady going , you only need use very light spritz . it lasted all day without changing character . this probably because its parfum spray , not eau de toilette . this sized bottle should last long time . perfumes very subjective , but i really liked scent . you still smell lingering fragrance your skin after shower . its definitely classic style rather than contemporary - think chanel rather than lo or brittney . overall , i think its one best new perfumes out . i bought this direct amazon - great price , buying direct amazon i know i get real thing , not knock-off . i don't same confidence other online stores , whether they sell through amazon or not . i bought some well-known online perfume stores past sent imitations or old stock - ugh . it made me very cautious where i shop . some fakes obvious but other ones very clever you only detect imitation if you already familiar product	1
bought this replacement earlier rechargeable braun . fantastic . very close shave . 3 weeks one charge !	1
i using this product week noticed big difference already . i am 28 just one or two creases around my eyes i am working fading , also preventative . this stuff works , i trying other roc products future .	1

i personally am connoisseur energy drinks . i rely caffeine most my projects school late night coding sessions well marathon gaming . although energy drinks considered crutch , it lifestyle decision many , many people embrace rather than attempt avoid ... i am one these people . said , guru energy fairly cheap ( $1.25 usd/can ) if you buy it here off amazon , it comes redbull standard 8.3 fl/oz cans , shipped suprisingly lightweight compact case ( compare this monster , rockstar , or any other brand standard 16 fl/oz cans ) . taste , like guru website describes , very indescribable . it very sharp light medium amount carbonation . caffeine buzz more " natural " ... it more upslope downslope rather than sudden cracked out ( which arguably awesome too its own respect ) then big crash sort feeling . this because caffeine guru derived 125mg guaranine ( guarana herb ) rather than synthetically separated then added . there no mention how much 125mg guaranine real caffeine , but since red bull checks 80mg / 8.3 oz it seems guru pretty good shape . i think particular good feature guru it uses cane sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup . i appriciate good quality soda , particularly microbrew colas , they often exclusively contain cane sugar . so summary , this energy drink farily cheap , good buzz , all natural , great coding , gaming , or studying	1
i love it works great , one flaw .... when you change numbers leneghth you want it trim , well you like ( 1|3|4|6 ... ) so one time i left it 11 , but didnt realize i pushed it down ( top ) .... well it went 1 , i could see 1 line so i figured it fine , well guess what , i lost my beard lol ...... they could made it more user friendly , but once you screw up once you realize never it again . otherwise works great ! wish there catcher all trimmed hair :-) kosher	-1
got this my mom . she'd looking one these while very happy product	1
not painful i thought it would legs , just some slight prickling , like little pins , you definitely tell it working . i thought this two heads i wouldn't go over same area again again , but i , this major drawback . horrible bikini line , don't even think it , pain goes feeling like little prickles feeling like great tufts hair pulled out once , when it really only getting few ; it also seemed skip over my skin pinch me well , we all know you don't want pinched there . overall : recommended legs large areas where skin taut easily accessible , not buy this product hopes using it your bikini line- buy braun silk epil xelle instead .	1
excellent product cleaning your glasses or other lenses . they small enough carry around your pocket . they lift off dirt , fingerprints , etc . i recommend washing your cloths weekly hot water keep them completely clean . cloths not scratch , but debris left cloth scratch	1
good9170xlcc gives excellent shave 5 minutes . it'll take 2 weeks daily use your beard adjust razor heads , but after it close clean any blade shave . bad : 1 . it cheaply made . norelco outsourced manufacturing it shows . frame holding razor heads plastic ; every other norelco i've owned ( over 30 years ) metal . frame supported these weird plastic-bubble " shock absorbers " probably go year or two . shaver junky , cheap feel it . i always gotten 5-6 years use out my past norelcos ; this one feels like it'll last two years . 2 . cleaning tank marketing gimmick sell $[ ... ]/bottle cleaning solution . way overkill . it work ok , but shaver gets just clean if you rinse it under hot tap water ( which you anyway because cleaning solution leaves razor heads coated slimy residue ) . you pretty much throw it out after free bottle solution used up . 3 . i'm already my second unit . chip controls battery level indicator , recharging , etc . flakey . first one i never could accurately display battery level even after 3 complete charge-discharge-recharge cycles . it'd show 15-20 minutes remaining , then just die middle shave ; battery tapped out . also , it would sometimes illuminate no reason all ; turn on-off clear it . if it happened during night , battery would fully discharged morning . so i returned it amazon.com ( thx amazon great customer service !!! ) . second one they sent me recharges continuously when you use it cleaning tank -- it not supposed charge during 55-minute cleaning cycle , but mine . means you catch it 5 minutes into cycle , after it it dunking tank , or it'll recharge completely after every shave ( which instructions tell you not because it shortens battery life ) . more reason toss cleaning unit . ridiculous shaver this expensive they'd ship junk their customers before fixing these problems . 4 . travel case worthless protecting shaver road . it nothing but zippered nylon sack . you'll put shaver into something else if you pack it checked luggage or it'll pile parts when you unpack . 5 . they don't include stand so when you're shaving you lay it bathroom countertop . i'm using one my old norelco , but if you don't one , storage shaves just setting it down somewhere . sad see fine old company like norelco cheapening it flagship product like this . i've customer 30+ years , but next time i'm market shaver i definitely comparison-shop competition . two stars because it give good shave ; rest mess	-1
i left review 90 count device , which same device but more uses tip . zeno works me , like charm . trick i've noticed , zeno advocates , catch them when they're first starting arrive - before you see them , but you feel them . proactive it'll what it says , i guess most people . other reviewer here points out it says " most people " or " most acne " , if this loop hole . any device like this , most devices/tools general don't work everyone . some straightening irons damage one persons hair while making another sleek shiny . some hair growth therapies work some , not others . so it toss up . my guess if you random annoying pimples , but not something you'd consider acne problem , you catch these pimples before they really develop show , this device you	1

i've used schick quattro 3 years now happy it . i thought i would try out this powered m3 razor see what all hype . many my friends said they got best shave ever using it : no razor burn , bumps , or nicks etc . however , m3 gave me more razor burn nicks than any razor i've ever used ! could it i wasn't used mach 3 blades after using quattro years ? rule out blade differences , i subsequently tried power quattro obtained similar , albeit less drastic , negative results . particular , both m3 power quattro really number my neck area . i even people comment how abused my neck looked after shaving these two razors . both gillette schick assert vibrations diminish irritation lead superior shave . my case , i believe vibrations actually lead more irritation ! my personal experience these razors , my cynical nature , lead me believe vibrating razors just ploy shaving industry get people buy more product ( i.e. , aftershave creams lotions cover up mess such razors create ) . my advice avoid these powered hybrids alltogether stick regular quattro or mach 3 razor .	-1

this norelco 6843xl made china . norelco took great razor design components , then , must told china make it cheap . so what china save money manufacturing ? it would unbelievable , except it china . they took perfectly wonderful 2.4 cord/cordless shaver only put one 1.2 battery it . this piece junk now runs slow boggs down wiskers . if you own one these you hate it , write norelco demand refund	-1

i just looking way get rid calluses my feet , so i figured foot spa good start . i've read various reviews elsewhere foot spas , dr. scholl came up favorite , so i'd figure i'd try it . i'm not sure what people expect foot spas , but i liked this one lot . unit lot places hold it , which big deal if you want put water it move it where you get thing work . lot water very heavy , but you actually don't need much this unit . there lines interior amount , which probably few quarts mos t.t he unit plastic hood thing where touch-toe controls located . you turn it massage very nifty bubbles massager thing . interior where you place your feet all these nubby things it , where you little self-massage . there also spaces both foot recepticles where you place two different foot massage attachments . one raised cylinder spins when you rub your feet against it ; it looks like something like small hamster wheel . one , i didn't like because it so high you can't rest your feet all water . rubbing action didn't help all . there insert just nubs it , like nubs bottom foot spa . this much more comfortable , what nubs : good place rub soles your feet . i used peppermint foot bath additive okay ( this something i added ; it not included foot spa . ) additive okay , not something i'd pay again , but bad thing it it impeded my use bubble mechanism . everytime i hit , peppermint stuff foamed up ridiculously spilled out foot spa . that shame , because nicest thing this device bubble mechanism . it really pleasant sensation ( so next time , if i add anything foot bath , i'll make sure it non-foaming ! )you put hot water this . massage control also heat controller . it not , directions say , make cold water hot . it , however , keep hot water hotter longer . i used this 20 minutes first time around , very hot water i used still nicely warm when i through . cleaning this bit bear . blue shield houses control device helps keep water warm not removable . means you go slinging around inside device wash dry it . just nuisance , not enough turn me off this foot spa . cord sufficently long , it wraps around elevated feet unit storage . only other thing i'd mention when you wash it out , sure tip it almost upside down get rid water . thin blue strip runs down center each foot areas where bubbles come out ; seems hold quite bit water even after you're emptying it . just turn it over give it good shake , that'll take care it . all all , i'd recommend this . it pleasant , it works well , softened calluses easy me pumice off after 20-minute soak .	1
if you don't like getting attention , these not you . i'm often surprised people astonished reactions act putting them taking them off ; i'm so accustomed pulling them apart , i forget how unusual viewing public finds it . i wearing clics nearly year . i pretend i don't need glasses , but course i nearly decade . popped standard diopter lenses out , put my bifocal prescription . it worked great , despite warning my optical shop . ( even if they broken experiment , price right : i could try it again . ) previously i wearing glasses chain . besides various difficulties noted reviewer , i also found plastic loops connect chain arms glasses bad habit stretching . then glasses slip off chain inappropriate times frames break . i call color mine " magenta " - which may or may not same online " red " - i bought them shop (** gasp **) . my short hair not problem , but i agree reading bed doesn't work . so i use different pair those occasions	1

owned my fountain four months run it constantly since i purchased it , i not any problems it whatsoever . it clever design - three pillar candles appear " melting , " but drip water pillar pillar . flickering leds make soothing patterns walls just bright enough approximate candle-like glow . falling water sound beautiful no t-t oo-loud . i keep it nightstand next bed . still night , it might seem little loud first , but you get used it relatively quickly . when i company , they usually seem intrigued gentle flicker light against wall . i would definitely buy . pros :( 1 ) soothing . sounds looks nice . ( 2 ) acts natural humidifier . ( 3 ) avoids fire hazards while i sleep ( unlike real candle) ! caveat(s ): ( 1 ) it bit cheap . candles made plastic , base ( it seems ) all parts . ( 2 ) occasionally , pump bit loud . remedy : you may able dampen loudness reducing vibration pump . place soft cloth underneath your fountain , such doily or washcloth . i cut small piece plastic under cloth well , catch any water may splash out ruin varnish nightstand . ( 3 ) not enough " river rocks " included it . i like make mine look like it sitting pile stones all around base , not just front . remedy : purchase cheap bag tumbled stones arrange them yourself	-1

i love these glasses . they always there when i need them ... hanging around my neck ready me put them place . only problem i experienced related application i am using them ... my shop . i got 3.00 so i could good close up look when necessary . however , i've noticed when i'm actively working around project getting myself different positions related object my work , glasses often separate where magnets positioned bridge glasses causing me clear both hands tools or whatever them reconnect lenses . it exasperating , but you've got able see your work . this design flaw product clearly doesn't apply most people situation . some might argue my head just too big ! while i may big ego , my head actually slightly smaller than average . this problem could likely corrected manufacturer extending each temple one inch give glasses more room expand before breaking apart . but important thing you know i'd still buy these glasses all over again . they really terrific	-1

any dental health professional attest , flossing one teeth just important brushing , perhaps more so , bacteria causes gum disease ( certain extent cavities ) almost always starts teeth . daily flossing breaks up film harmful bacteria allows it removed . therefore , dentist , i am always stressing importance daily flosing my patients . my advice this : 1 . choose floss comfortable you right thickness your teeth . some people prefer floss holders rather than wrapping floss around fingers , while others prefer thin flavored floss waxed thick floss . there so many options - choose right one you . 2 . waxed floss " waxed " allow easier passage teeth . waxed floss no more effective than unwaxed removing bacterial film build-up . important thing floss ! 3 . floss once daily , preferably before brushing . flossing breaks up film bacteria teeth areas toothbrush cannot reach . it important then brush teeth rinse teeth remove film bacteria flossing dislodged . without brushing or rinsing after flossing , bacteria reattach teeth . 4 . try tie flossing habit , such watching 10 pm news . i know it sounds strange , but incorporating flossing into habit leads one into developing new habit . some complain they don't time floss ; well , if flossing tied into habit , such watching tv , both easily concurrently . 5 . there many gimmicks manufacturers use sell their particular brand floss . some flavor floss , some incorporate fluoride into strands floss , some make their floss more slippery folks tight contacts . whatever case , most important point choose floss variety you use regularly . it mechanical act removing bacterial flim important part , not flavoring or chemical additions floss . 6 . if you want keep your teeth life-time , develop flossing habit . one wise sage said : " if you ignore your teeth , they eventually go away " . i recommend this product because it effective relatively easy use . i found it tends shred more than regular floss , this bothers me bit so i not use it regularly . i like mint flavor fluoride cannot hurt either . all all , it good product . jim " konedog " koenig , dds	-1

although this sunscreen not pasty white look like some other zinc-oxide sunscreens , it greasy , slippery shiny , plus it stings if you get it your eyes . not good sunscreen face . blue lizard sensitive sunscreen better choice my opinion , but trade off sensitive sunscreen ( which zinc oxide titanium dioxide ) pasty look . i planned use this sunscreen surfing running but i wouldn't recommend it those or similar activities	-1

finish not very smooth or fully blended . it doesn't live up its claim 14 hour moisturization either ( similar sunscreens other brands don't moisturize well , but they don't claim moisturize begin ) . so better apply moisturizer first then this sunscreen . however , it cheapest complete spectrum sunscreen sensitive skin . if you wanna pay nicer finish , go olay complete defense spf 30 sensitive skin ; or better protection 9.1% titanium oxide , go neutrogena spf 30 sunblock lotion sensitive skin . neutrogena one leaves even whiter finish though	-1

so far , this scale fairly good . it gave weights pretty close what other electronic scales gave ( . 5lb increment this scale precise enough , those you wanting . 2lb increment ) . my body fat measurements fairly consistent , it not varying more than 1% day day . but !!! main suspicion i this scale it seems " lazy " weight measurement change . what i mean ? let say , example , you weight yourself scale says 154lbs . if you step off , take off jacket u know weights 1.5 lbs , step scale again , scale show you still weight 154lbs . but ! here when it gets interesting , i suspected scale might ' shor t-t erm ' memory built into its eletronics simply go back most recently measured weight if difference weight small enough . so , i weighted myself , say , 154 , then made scale go some other weight , say 130 , then take off my jacket weight myself again , guess what ? i now get 152.5 lbs . so , summary , pretty precise good scale , but some reason , its designers decided build ' cheat ' like just give illusion it even more precise	-1
