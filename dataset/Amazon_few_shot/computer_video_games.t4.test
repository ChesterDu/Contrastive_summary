first game we played gamecube spongebob , battle bikini bottom . we absolutely loved it my daughter plays it over over . thinking shrek 2 would similar , we rented it . it very hard control c-stick it kept zooming out wouldn't rotate camera except certain times . charactors very distant even if we used c-stick zoom , it still wasn't close enough . it same feeling needing put eyeglasses see something more clearly ! aspect we didn't like four charactors always together you would lose track which one main charactor . maybe we're spoiled because c-stick spongebob allowed you rotate every direction see what around you graphics so good you could see facial expressions . it surprising all reviews so good because our impression completely opposite .	-1
then this not work your console . but if you huge old ps2 console then this work you console . if you slim console then you should get game shark	-1
my friends i high hopes this game . we played cod2 multiplayer every week excited new shooter . after playing cod3 few rounds we decided put 2 back . graphics great , but we found lot bugs . there some shading problems helmets made them turn white certain distance . that fine if you want un soldier , but not if you're trying sneak up somebody . muzzle flashes almost none existent . no blood splash like cod2 . single player game isn't too bad so far , but if you plan multiplayer i would recommend renting it first . we opinion game rushed , maybe they'll patch it	-1
if you need remote turn tele run 360 , this . but it won't operate dvr , dvd , vcr or cable box . if you're really keen it , i'll sell you mine .	-1
this remote awful quality ; i've through two them past year . i wouldn't complain so much if it didn't cost $30 ! it worth ten , most . most people would better off buying cheap dvd player , rather than using xbox	-1
everyone seemed really excited this game ; supposed great launch title , etc . turns out red steel fails deliver like dominoes during hurricane . graphics meh ( ubisoft could way better ) , controls bit awkward . this isn't because wii controller itself ... played zelda wii sports , i say controller works very very well . so i am inclined think bulkiness shooting red steel , fact using your sword more like clubbing baby seal then fighting grace master samurai , game design , not any fault controller . storyline isn't amazing either . pretty straight-forward neverending quest save your girlfriend ( brownie points if you got pop culture reference ! ) , shoot lot japanese people process . nothing innovative see here , move now . it could lot better . i'm selling this one back ebgames getting trauma center instead . disappointing launch title .	-1
amazon . ca --------- action replay max more than just video game enhancer ( vge ) .... or least it claims . my version quite old yet but it claims include region-free dvd player memory card compression utility ( squeeze more saves onto your memory card ) . i not used either these features personally , but i heard horror stories memory manager corrupting gamesaves whole memory cards ; some reusable , some permanently damaged . this fact you must load up action replay software access saves use memory manager turned me off using it . however , real reason i bought armax its codes i'll get those second . armax , like newer gamesharks , loads its software cd . this major annoyance me . every time you load game you must insert armax memory card ( which i don't know what ) cd , go sit couch wait software load , choose your codes , then get up put actual game dvd wait it load . you can't simply turn your ps2 go sit down . old days cartridge gaming you would snap vge game console so you could turn console go sit down . early generation gamesharks little box would attach expansion slot ps1 or n64 it . if you wanted it load before game , you turned its switch . even if armax perfect every other way ( it not , btw ) , it would get maximum 4 stars long you boot it cd first . i mean , why can't memory card part it least hold codes even just current game you're playing after system shut off or reset so you don't load software every @mn time . ok , rant over . codes . user interface armax better than gameshark . functionally , they very similar course , but armax just feels cleaner easier use . it offers beginner interface includes descriptions code functions ( not user-entered ones though , if i remember right ) , more robust expert mode . big advantage , theory , armax over gameshark its ability update itself using your ps2 broadband connection . upshot you download new codes your favorite games fairly quickly instead manually typing them all using controller . dark cloud go this silver lining you no control over which codes you download ; its all or nothing . since these updates stored your memory card ( not armax one ) , it quickly fill up codes gamesaves games 99% which you never play ! no wonder armax option come 16 or 32mb space its memory card . it store all useless codes ! any entered codes you choose apply either work , nothing , or lock up game . i come across all , though armax credit , mostly former . absurd choice forcing you download save updates every game ps2 library , when you may want just one , loses armax star . note manually entering codes : sub-headings folders game their own codes must entered if you want them show up game code list . finally , mentioned reviews bret morris glenn nichols ( amazon.ca ) , armax initially not work new revision fat ps2 couple years ago all . this happened me well . i returned three ps2s two armaxes before i realized it defect all current versions ( time ) armax . i send away get new disc direct intec which now works well expected . since armax shelves several years since i bought mine , i assume any bought today would not this problem . however , time there no way find out this problem without contacting intec personally . retailers not aware problem no notices posted codejunkies web site . this inadequate treatment widespread problem drops armax down two stars . my opinion , if you're market vge , both armax gameshark their pros cons . i would assume both released newer versions newer features than ones i . looks specs , assume nothing , don't afraid e-mail companies requesting details regarding any features you questions . i apologize length this review , but i find there very few in-depth reviews vges web or print . maybe reviewers feel they above using vges , i don't know .	-1
this product not designed 360 team , really most products aren't aren't very good your 360 . this no exception , it known actually damage , destroy your 360 . statement 360 representative not but this product , it caused numerous problems lot people . mainly because it actually draws power 360 , that not good , leads lot other problems .	-1
i agree other reviewers graphics vocals good , but i find gameplay itself less than stellar . starters , i've always irritated games don't let you save your status whenever you want . sometimes i just want get quick dose gameplay , but that not possible these games require you play through entire section before allowed save . contributes repetitive , tedious nature some sections . if you get stuck getting through certain bit game , you're doomed replay much what led up it over over again . i realize tricky camera angles some challenges supposed exist this game . more than earlier versions , however , i trouble getting myself lined up whatever task . tedious element . i found this game more test my endurance patience than actual fun	-1

i try keep this brief ... way i'm only 10 hrs thru ... only just got out city #1 rabernastre , dalmasca now city #2 bahjerba ( sp ? ) : quickly , my first impressions game strange ... i like " meh i dunno if i want keep playing ... " but after maybe 20 min getting ' wierdness ' it really sucks you . ughh i really wish i didn't midterms coming up so i could go home play ! pros : - love battle system ! it still strategy but it doesn't require you random battles ... ughh i'd hate " whzzzhhh " starting random battles ... i still feel control but doing less actual work . - like everyone else says , cg always good . - story ... though not much character development/focus previous ones , i like whole war/polity centered plot . it follow fft tradition . - i actually like license board ... some people said it pain beginning , but so far it hasn't case me ... granted i very early game decide level up vaan bit ( ~ 40 min or so ) . you really just need know only use board when you really need ... don't randomly buy spots board just things become available its difficult one person learn everything . plan , plan , plan . ( right now way i'm constructing my chars way game hints ... its only one way it , but first time around i'll follow it ... already licensed equipment/abilities hint what they'll good . )- huge game . lots stuff see ... quite beautiful . - character design ... course there always someone love ... ( har har har ... fangirl i must say i love basch :d lol ... tho i love babyface earlier ff characters i think vaan too babyfaced . he looks like kid . -- haha i'm college student such fangirl ... haha ... sad isn't it ? -- if i guy , i'd say i'd like fran most ... this course subject personal opinion . )- i like subs i like how they not bland ... they fancy font this time :d . ( kinda reminds me nochnoi dozor . ) makes game really movie-ish . - widescreen capability ... ( looks sweet my widescreen pc monitor . )- course everyone always talks realism selling pelts what not ... i also like . - free-moving camera ... thank heaven . i love it . i hated still camera immensely ffx . - cute monsters ... lol love cactuar like monster rogue tomato ! - also love how you avoid some boss moves skillfully moving around them . cons : - huge game ... ( yes also con ) ... lots time running around . good thing all characters don't run painstakingly slow tidus ffx . meh ... neutral : - voices - i dunno what up people liking previous ff voice actors but anyhoo i thought this time there better ones . prev . ff voice actors okay but not great . here voice actors really good , but choice some them seems strange ... like i problem fran voice ... it strange choice strange voice . also balthier voice doesn't seem go his look , but i really like voice acting itself . ( sum , some voices , though really well acted , didn't seem fit actor look ... however , i favor good actors mismatched roles over okay actors well-matched roles so i give voice acting mild thumbs up . ) after reading review which mentioned mispronunciations , i feel i must also address ... someone who speaks some french i twitch when i heard " marquis " pronounced both " markus " " marquis " rather than " markee . " i also twitch when they pronounced " fete " " feet " rather than " feh-t . " - soundtrack - i liked all music ( there lot ) taken fft ... esp battle music estersand , i think it ... totally taken fft ( obviously both take place same world ) ... i enjoy non-midi renditions themes ... but rest new guy music just ' meh ' ... wasn't particularly bad , but it didn't really stand out much either	1

this game mysteriously hilarious always fun play . you don't exactly " finish " it , like other video games , but always trying beat your fastest time , so it doesn't get old fast . matter fact , we wore out our last copy this our second . i love it i'm parent ! my kids i play it together cheer each other . only thing i would change make two-player part funner stop giant messages pop up cover whole screen occassionally . i would keep them corner instead . overall , highly recommend this game . more than your money worth	1

i throughly enjoyed this game . voice acting may not greatest , but i think gameplay really well atmospheres fantastic . controls take some getting used too not everyone . they problem could better control , surprisenly i it very well . major problem i game progresses it gives you less times save , so you go through almost entire level ( though short ) complete it without saving once . so stupid because if you die end you entire level over again , dumbest thing ever video game . i just feel it unfair game makers make fairly difficult level then make you it over over if you slip die toward end . stupid , stupid , stupid . levels bit difficult if you're not one quick trigger . much i gripe camera angles , they're useful stopping max end hall , swing camera around see if enemy around corner , waiting steps , right inside next room , etc . it gives you heads up makes it easier stay alive . however , i still really liked it . i didn't enjoy mp2 much , but mp3 ( which should end series i think ) should , ( re : should ) much better . i'm looking forward it .	1
i always loved mario , when i purchased my new nintendo ds lite , i bought this it . this game absolutely amazingly fun ! graphics , sound , game itself incredible . this game good any adult or child . although younger child , it might bit more difficult possibly frustrating . ;) this game you try some harder levels over again , possibly again after . but every time you try again , you understand something new level , it really fun . there also features becoming mega mario mini mario which mixes things up every once while . this game wonderful , definitely great buy .	1
yeah this game really fun , just gets extremely hard times towards end . little over 10 hours into it , kind short i guess , but each mission might take you few tries complete . plus fact you might spend 30 tries some like i . i'd say it easily one best games out ds though . one everyone should their ds collection .	1
amazon.com listed this " king quest compilation " instead " king quest collection " which clearly printed my box game , well picture website . i don't know why . game itself , i remember loving king quest games when i younger . i bought this game mostly " king quest vi " which so far seemed work fine , exception one time when game kicked me out no apparent reason . this particular version " king quest vi " also seems draw it graphics original release game not cd release later , so also somewhat disappointing . captain saladin no longer looks like lassie . overall , it nice access these games nostalgia	1
what better than game made adults or kids ? sly , sneaky humor only adults understand greatest toy ever created legos ! all theme best star wars movies !! many games put ' replayability ' allowing you go through game or missions second or third time different character , but lego star wars this fashion totally fun . it not simple regurgitation map different character ( wihoo replayable ... ) but rather ingenious method rewards you additional pieces building well secret areas previously unobtainable . instance , you might need stormtrooper ( or uniform ) , jedi ( dark or light ) , or even bounty hunter enter specific areas . droids often used access areas well , but you usually them during missions . using ' free play ' mode , you go back through missions character you created , or any other character you unlocked . during mission , you cycle through your characters use their abilities . this allows you go back unlock new areas find additional bricks etc . fact there new abilities characters you find later well new areas explore really makes replayability fun worthwhile . aspect this game i absolutely love cooperative play . this great adults able play kids , or even spouses . my wife doesn't play lot xbox titles , but she loves playing this game we blast going through missions together . i'm surprised more games don't actually give you coop play like this . seems it enough toss death match label game ' multiplayer ' . my only complaint camera , both single cooperative mode . often times camera shift based one players force other player back towards center screen . more than one occasion , this caused death characters or when we get stuck forces one players swap characters midstream . sometimes this isn't obvious player . it would really nice option split screen , especially real estate hdtv provides . all all , i would highly recommend this game . especially if you kids want spend some quality time them . great game	1
third installment since rebirth classic series presumably final chapter " sands time " saga , " two thrones " takes best elements " sands time " ( game one ) " warrior within " ( its sequel ) caps franchise style , finesse , gameplay sharp scimitar blade . you once again assume mantle nameless prince persia . returning home babylon long last find it ruins its people war army sand monsters , prince also finds himself company old friends ... old enemies . cursed , he comes find his body soul split two , periodically his wicked self , known dark prince , rises forth wreak havoc take control prince body . storyline entertaining , its characters more developed than most video games , it strikes nice balance darkness light-heartedness ... something " warrior within " failed achieve . essence , it what you would get if you took tone presentation games one two rolled them together . mentioned before , gameplay not far either . while " sands time " set tone its acrobatic platforming , which remains pretty much tact , " warrior within " took game weak combat mechanics fleshed them out into something little more interesting . happily , both elements retained improved upon this new installment . what more , " tenchu " -like stealth kills now available . while they're far perfectly executed ( sometimes they seem unresponsive ) , they nonetheless offer fresh twist opportunity avoid hand-to-hand combat many circumstances . dark prince significant addition . regularly , throughout course game , prince transforms into this alter-ego - sand monster version himself able use weapon called daggertail . this weapon functions much like belmont whip " castelvania " game , allowing dark prince attack his enemies also swing poles light fixtures access new areas prince couldn't hope reach . while stronger than prince combat , unfortunately dark prince he must sustain himself constant supply sand power or succumb death when it all used up . makes these portions game more intense , , rare occasions , little more frustrating . also new series chariot trials , sequences during which prince must escape via horse-drawn wagons through hazardous environments full speed ahead . while they provide nice change pace when they actually occur , they relatively few trial error nature them lead irritation . there only few glaring flaws " thrones . " sound effects ambient music retain their inconsistent , buggy feel . too often dialogue sputters repeats like broken record , music kind fades departs little rhyme or reason . well , graphics suffer some pretty blatant clipping problems . engine aged pretty gracefully , but it aged - least character designs architecture go long way keep you distracted occasional failings visuals . " prince persia : two thrones " , many respects , very similar game two come before it . therefore it not novel first game longtime followers , but it doesn't feel long tooth it might this stage thanks new gameplay additions entertaining continuation story . it certainly better game than " warrior within , " more welcoming almost every way . this series lot life it , " two thrones " well worth your time effort .	1
this game really good , but i don't think they tested it enough figure out loading times way too long . so if you not lot patience , good luck this game :	1
i know i'm little late , but what heck ? i felt like writing review this game . final fantasy just fantastic game . simple . its extremely deep , fantastic story , great characters , great battle system , it perfect length rpg ( 45-55 hours ) . not everyone likes tidus , he honestly doesn't bother me , i think he interesting character . rest cast well developed , they all interesting personalities distinct this universe . cast very memorable , you'll remember them years come , i think speaks volumes how good this game . its enhanced usual good voice acting square known , so doesn't disapoin t.t he gameplay extremely fun , its actually one my favorite battle systems . battle system make or break rpg , this one doesn't disappoint . its fast paced , so it doesn't get bogged down long battles . you also swap characters mid battle , thats awesome feature . gameplay also incredibly deep , i've heard people literally pouring hundreds hours into this game . so if thats your thing , i'm sure you've probably already played this game . if some reason you not played this game your into rpg , don't hesitate pick this game up , its cheap now , its one best most balanced rpg i've ever played	1

this kit not just card . previous review indicated bestbuy.com selling this $49.99 . not correct . they selling card $49.99 . this kit comes card plus several other components , thus making it $20 more . you may find this kit cheaper elsewhere , but not significantly . it what it intends .	1
pros : 1 . storyline very detailed . there lot twists turns . i'm not going spoil it ... find out yourself :) 2 . weapons very nice . everything classic crowbar ( yay ! ) gravity gun preform very well . you damage just anything environment use it your advantage . 3 . physics amazing . water rippling things flying through air all very well . makes you get real sense game . 4 . a.i. challenging varified . also different weapons work better some than others so it fun experiment . 5 . there no really specific road follow this game . you explore find secret compartments stuff . 6 . there actually bunch little thinkers this game . order get somewhere , like sewage tunnel or over fence , you may something first , such flip switch or put something somewhere . gives you challenge . 7 . saving nice . you save anywhere game . so if you lose , you'll just go back you last checkpoint . cons : 1 . it loads lot . if you xbox w/ lot games it it might load slower . i'm not positive though . it runs pretty good mine but yeah , there quite lot point loading . ( but game itself makes up it ) i rated half-life 2 4/5 stars b/c it very good game . it very accurate it gameplay , making it challenging fun . plus who can't resist playing baseball headcrabs .	1
early game you use pistol rifle take down some stormtroopers new republic you explore their base , no force powers . but events make turn worse you go luke request your lightsaber back . then you begin discover force powers you search out dark jedi/killer your girlfriend rest game . amazing graphics increddible duels , this game simply magnificent . plus multiplayer awesome ( especially when you play ctf give other team boat load storm troopers you your friend rebels one bot helping you against twenty or so stormtroopers makes game game you'll never want trade ! plus duels fun play again again . i would five stars but game two or three puzzles quite difficult . all all great game any starwars fan must own , any shooter fan really , if you like both , oooh you need it really bad	1
i love this game ! it not too hard kids play ( my 10 year old beat it max points finds all secrets ) it not trashy so parents let their kids play it , they keep it clean kids some adult humor but nothing raunchy , it also cool so us adults play well ! i love creating skaters parks kids love secret skaters like jesse james jester etc . graphics better this game than others my opinion also .	1
while i think some reviews xenosaga ii little harsh , they hit few good points . terms plot , first thing really let me down kos-mos . don't let her face covering cover game fool you . while one main characters first game , she hardly anything this game until end , which seems less like plot point more creators obliging her . same said shion well . this shift center stage hurts these characters , it really disappointing . instead , jr. takes center stage . instead shedding light events first game , it opens up whole knew set issues really don't get resolved . if you're looking story pull first game , it'll hard find this game . jr. character i personally don't care much , but if you fan him , then you'll enjoy this game , you learn lot his past u.r.t.v.a new character introduced shion brother , jin uzuki . personally , i liked jin , but you don't get use him much game . him , shion , jr. albedo , there underlying theme " brothers " or " siblings " story , although don't look much elaboration jin shion . although some people aren't pleased battle system this game , i actually enjoyed it . i caught into it quicker than first game system . you also acquire skill points out enemies ' weak zones , which i found very useful . i also liked able build up attacks , then boost really slam enemy . overall , it game i really enjoyed . game some replay value it , there certain things you actually can't accomplish until you've beaten game once . times , re-watching certain scenes over over again gets boring . yet i would recommend this series , if nothing else , it serves bridge first game upcoming third game .	1
i love final fantasy games . they reason i still my nes snes . this really take me back early days square . admittedly , i've gotten older my tastes changed past 15 years ( i think its long since ff1 released ) , but this game just makes me smile . completing chocobo side quests , making sure mognet gets back online , defeating hades ozma , power leveling like mad man , laughing zidane bad ladies i am . all all , important parts game what kept me playing . now , i say there few annoying parts . you should never sell any equipment . synth shop wonderful idea , but some items end game , you need weapons you got beginning disc 1 . also some weapons disappear face planet you switch discs . little fact causes quite annoying problem those us who like see every ability fully mastered every character ( if you cant tell , i kid spent 3 months downed shin-ra plane getting everyone 255 stat points ) . overall this outstanding game . it keeps me wanting play , it makes my chronic insomnia relapse , i love just watching vivi dance during fights watching zidane get shot down over over interim . graphics this game simply beautiful . its not something ooooo ahhhh you , but if you give them second look ( after you get over cartoon-like feel ) you'll notice they someone took their time this production . someone made sure every single detail perfect . ffvii felt 2d while you knew scenery 3d endeavor , it felt like 2d isometric drawing rather than fully 3d rendered scene . when you look ffix you know you looking fully 3d environment . it really great thing see especially psx ( even though xbox 360 now out ) . characters ... what i say characters . i love them . they all make me smile . i relate completely zidane social life , then his story took me off guard first time i heard it ( i wasn't expecting it , it made me want play longer ) . garnet interesting . she naive girl we all knew high school . it just seems every character their own story it pretty well explored ( really , what you know yuffie , zell , quistis irvine ) . you ever wonder how reeve controlled cait sith while he talking scarlet heidegger ? i really not lot unanswered questions like ffix , just some things could elaborated ( like summoner village ) , but all-in-all i think story pretty perfect . my only big complaint length game . there lot stuff , but end game reached under 12 hours ( 4 months work get certain sword .... stay ragnarok if you reading this ... saying " i got excalibur ii " not worth heartache ) . this game gets 4 stars because while it good game , i just wish there more it . there plenty side quest stuff , just not enough story time . 12 hours story just long aeris stays breathing ff7 . hope this makes your purchasing decision little easier . its definitely great game heck , if worse comes worse , it good time killer rainy weekend	1
i've this game since day it came out some cutscenes my opinion better than lot games out today . this games unique gameplay i think adds its satisfactory . i love everything this game example : music : this games music unreal compared practically every other ps1 game out there . if you take time listen it your not one those gamers like i used before i actually listened any games music , than u not disappointed . gameplay : i absolutely love this games gameplay because its unique style . even though u cant really tell how much you leveled up , you still get idea when it gives u new star so you learn new moves more slots more space new put more skills . charater attack system : there 40 characters this game which i think all promote there own indivituality others . some them may same same type sometimes same basic idea move , but each character uniqely different looking than others , lot them use different weapons , armor . but one i like most all way your special moves each character get cooler looking much stronger you gain stars or levels . some people say getting so much more powerful attacks every level contributes make this games battle system easy . i dont think all because types people advantages over others so u know . but even if you , enemies heal more than you , some enemies you run because their so hard . so i dont think its simple . challenge level : i think overall this game very challenging because battle system because there countless # puzzles figure out game definetly add games difficulty . i also think games length adds its challenge meter , because there so many different paths you take game change story line , so you get different characters . so if you dont get some first time you play , you start game same data everything game before . so i think this game game you can't beat so easily one day . i would recommend this game anyone whos looking inexpensive rpg thats lengthy unique battle style amazing everything else makes this ps1 game one best games ever created date .	1
nintendo dominated handheld industry since gameboy came out . now sony stepped , some predicted their hold might finally breaking . not so , there no better proof than ds lite . lite evolutionary step over original ds , similar gameboy advance sp . it more compact form factor , brighter screens , side-mounted power button , weighs less , longer battery life , simply looks more fashionable . basic functionality ds still here- same buttons general button layout , wi-fi , gba compatibility , etc . this worth buying if you already ds ? maybe , if you've got some spare cash . this worth buying if you don't own ds ? definitely . design far superior old ds . no ds review would complete without further mention psp . while psp undoubtedly more capable device , it significant weaknesses compared ds . particularly , psp games tend far longer load times , it much shorter battery life , hardware itself more fragile . oh , course , there cost . most critical factor , however , library games available . now , ds games more better , there simply no contest when it comes which more offer this department . games what really make or break console , wide variety excellent casual immersive ds titles make it clearcut winner .	1
i am fan arena football . i enjoy watching it because it exciting , but this game doesn't live up real game . game very similiar nfl blitz except nfl blitz better . what makes unleashed worse there less teams pick all you pass . most action comes after play over when players jump each other beat each other up . if you thinking buying this game , rent it first see if it really worth money	1

i've never taken time write review before , but all negative comments made me feel obligated defend this game . number negative reviews point out many aspects game far simpler railroads compared rrt3 , which absolutely correct . if you seeking complex simulation , railroads not game you . if , however , you wanting fun easy grasp game trains , then i wholeheartedly recommend railroads . it one my favorite games all time	1
this game took my 9 year old son 2 days complete . it disappointment since i paid $30 it , but action adventure games make younger kids make wiser decisions . overall this game deserves a+ . not adult type game but fun kids .	1
i bought this my husband ... um yep he still it .. he never touched video game until i got him gt2 then 3 came out he showed little more interest .. now 4 well lets just say he it when ever he gets time . cars , lots cars . tracts challege even toughest driver . so much offer little cd package . image quality so realistic times you make yourself remember they not real . places you see roads you travel ... wow all i think knowing it hardly touches beauty you we see . going how often i hear my hubby yell other drivers field shows me just how it draws you into its reality ... well worth price i think ... wonder if its my turn play now ....	1
i love final fantasy games . they reason i still my nes snes . this really take me back early days square . admittedly , i've gotten older my tastes changed past 15 years ( i think its long since ff1 released ) , but this game just makes me smile . completing chocobo side quests , making sure mognet gets back online , defeating hades ozma , power leveling like mad man , laughing zidane bad ladies i am . all all , important parts game what kept me playing . now , i say there few annoying parts . you should never sell any equipment . synth shop wonderful idea , but some items end game , you need weapons you got beginning disc 1 . also some weapons disappear face planet you switch discs . little fact causes quite annoying problem those us who like see every ability fully mastered every character ( if you cant tell , i kid spent 3 months downed shin-ra plane getting everyone 255 stat points ) . overall this outstanding game . it keeps me wanting play , it makes my chronic insomnia relapse , i love just watching vivi dance during fights watching zidane get shot down over over interim . graphics this game simply beautiful . its not something ooooo ahhhh you , but if you give them second look ( after you get over cartoon-like feel ) you'll notice they someone took their time this production . someone made sure every single detail perfect . ffvii felt 2d while you knew scenery 3d endeavor , it felt like 2d isometric drawing rather than fully 3d rendered scene . when you look ffix you know you looking fully 3d environment . it really great thing see especially psx ( even though xbox 360 now out ) . characters ... what i say characters . i love them . they all make me smile . i relate completely zidane social life , then his story took me off guard first time i heard it ( i wasn't expecting it , it made me want play longer ) . garnet interesting . she naive girl we all knew high school . it just seems every character their own story it pretty well explored ( really , what you know yuffie , zell , quistis irvine ) . you ever wonder how reeve controlled cait sith while he talking scarlet heidegger ? i really not lot unanswered questions like ffix , just some things could elaborated ( like summoner village ) , but all-in-all i think story pretty perfect . my only big complaint length game . there lot stuff , but end game reached under 12 hours ( 4 months work get certain sword .... stay ragnarok if you reading this ... saying " i got excalibur ii " not worth heartache ) . this game gets 4 stars because while it good game , i just wish there more it . there plenty side quest stuff , just not enough story time . 12 hours story just long aeris stays breathing ff7 . hope this makes your purchasing decision little easier . its definitely great game heck , if worse comes worse , it good time killer rainy weekend	1
when ever i go lan parties , everyone there prefers this controller . theres only one person who used bulky , original , " duke " controller . when he , it often dissconnects him no reason . controller lot better my perspective . its what i've always used what majority population uses . they should just call it xbox controller , without suffix	1
my 8 10 year old love this . i highly recommed it anyone . it helps teach kids how sing pitches tones . kids love dress up their characters . even boys neighborhood get invovled . i see this lasting years come .	1
my kids ( 11 7 , 2nd 6th graders ) first played this game friend house . they both begged it . they not stopped playing it . thing we live texas sometimes it just way too hot play outside . there always news reports kids just sitting around . this game makes you move !!! they played so hard first day they got it they both so sore next day . i recommend this toy several people . first , if you need get your kid moving , this great . if you hyper children need outlet , this great . if you need exercise more , this great . if weather doesn't permit your active kid go outsice this toy great . if your kid wants see him or herself tv this great ! if your kid afraid try new things front others , this great . this toy got my boy sign up little league . both my kids already active , so they play hard , but it irresistable temptation even inactive kids . everyone neighborhood loves it	1
i now played " vp2 " few days now , i say i like it . it its problems , but overall , it very fun game . " vp2 " takes place 100 or so years before original " vp " . i won't spoil any plot , except say many ruins visited original game appear beautiful cities " vp2 " , one gets sense we see why these cities became ruins course game . graphically , game beautiful . movies nice , if stiff times , sound great . mechanically , however , there some issues . " vp2 " attempts keep essence battle system original intact , while adding 3-d wrinkle . unfortunately , controls so gummy times you frustrated often you pleased results new system . all all , though , game excellent . i drop it star because control issues ..	1
katamari damacy breath fresh air increasingly stale gaming world . it title you likely never get tired , it odd but simple gameplay draws you back again again . music background especially catchy fun listen , makes me smile whenever i hear it . entire game experience not unlike pleasant feelings you experience after hours prolonged zen meditation , i would recommend game anyone looking something new . game only flaw it little short ; i wish it twice or three times long it .	1
story ( 10/10 ): star wars : knights old republic puts you world complete bliss utterly fantastic awe . this not just shoot-em-up game , within millions pixelated characters lies story . story jaw-dropping , mind-blowing twists turns conclusions awaiting . choose your path , first time , you choose your own destiny rather than creators . this game not just one plot , nor it mindless adventure trekking whereabouts middle nowhere looking purpose . no , this game many quests riddles , illusions games inside keep gamers their tippy-toes all times . starting out mysterious rebel who not know his/her own past , fight or peacefully sneak your way through depths several planets , each carrying many people many stories . you may help these people , you may there savior deny reward , or you may bash their helpless heads into their skulls create your path dark side . all while making venture across native lands toward beoming jedi , encounter friends , enounter foes convert them friends if you ever so wish . it doesn't matter , because end it only you facing evil sith lord , toe toe , lightsaber lightsaber . gameplay ( 9/10 ): fighting system somewhat random , but not entirely , you choose create concrete combat fighter or wizard casting spells such lighting , wind , life draining , lightsaber throwing , etc . many different various skills such stealth , persuasion , even computer hacking lockpicking ( sort ) . you stay close using lightsabers , one each hand or double-bladed one . or you stray afar using blaster rifles pistols . you many compainions , droids , jedis , dark side mercenaries wookies , each charming , dramatic , or brutal life story , which only concluded game furthers . very impressive dialogue screenwriting , graphics realism also mediocre . i guarantee , low $20 price , this game give you hours fun , each day , least month . trust me , when month up , you not want get rid it , you get urge play it again because once you start this game you hooked long-term engagement . only thing i find wrong this game it sequel . pros : ~ excellent sound , effects , dialogue , screenplay , scenery , designing story writing . ~ hundreds weapons , armor , belts , gloves , arm bands , implants masks further increase skills . ~ hundreds side quests extravagant rewards conclusions keep you awe all day long . ~ no wondering world world search plots , they usually easy find but challenging ( not boring ) accomplish . ~ no matter what , you always play game different way , so you would just beginning your quest soon you beat game . ~ neat little area xbox live downloadable content , which open up plot give you very nice weapons two new lightsaber colors . ( turquoise , orange) ~ you change overall game difficulty , it default setting medium . cons : ~ no type multiplayer games any circumstance . it surprising they didn't make o-o perative option . ~ sometimes annoying loading transitions , take maybe 10-15 seconds most . i'd advise some music handy if it your 2nd or 3rd time through game	1
i am fan arena football . i enjoy watching it because it exciting , but this game doesn't live up real game . game very similiar nfl blitz except nfl blitz better . what makes unleashed worse there less teams pick all you pass . most action comes after play over when players jump each other beat each other up . if you thinking buying this game , rent it first see if it really worth money	1
one best ds games i ever . it not take lawyer get fully satisfied this game . although this heavily text-based game ( i mean really heavy ! ) , you won't get tired reading storylines following details . i know you won't find this any stores nowadays so try order here amazon . this game one best	1
yes , xbox best video game system i ever bought . i own , also , gamecube , me big mario fan ( sierously , who isnt ? ) . i've my xbox , oh , two years . but recently , it died . i'm not sure what went wrong . cords fine . i've even bought replacement cords , but it just wont come life . i thinking buying xbox 360 , until i read all bad reviews . apperently , 360 some kinks it . so , i plan buying xbox . if i you , i would purchase xbox , not 360 . ups : -great graphics . -sound = awesome . -game genre awesome ! -no need " memory cards " . -you use consol dvd player , music player ! downs : -controllers bit bulkish . -a bit faulty . obviously , more ups than downs !	1

i hearing reading all rave over this game , i finally got it myself . you tell my giving it high " star " rating , i really like it , so i'm raver now . however , if you've not played it but used first person shooter ( fps ) games , you may find this one somewhat unique . main difference far cry other popular fps games like halo doom series , this game not fast paced . far cry requires more sneaking around , use cover , diversions , etc . all all , it requires more tactical approach , rather than " bust room mow ' em down shotgun " approach . but still , there certainly intense moments just every stage where action hot . technical side : this game very robust requires array strong computing components run it . install requires 4gb . i dell w/a 2.6 ghz processor , 512 mb ram , 64 mb geforce 4 mx video card . it runs game no problem , but i one little code modification regarding directx 9.0 , but easy . i would highly recommend 128 mb video card so you run game richer graphic settings . if you like me , you prefer using game pad rather than keyboard mouse , you're out luck . there just no option any other method control . however , much i prefer my logitech rumble pad , i've found keyboard/mouse just fine this game , actually precision good mouse probably preferable . so , if you haven't got it yet , check it out !	1
ncaa football 2006 captures college atmosphere extremely well . game loads fun . load times decent , dynasty mode adds tremendous replay value , quest heisman pseudo-ripoff nfl 2k series crib feature . i still love this game . i even like music . it doesn't bother me lee corso kirk herbstreit commentary repetitive . only thing i take issue every year ea brags strength ai yet you run option successfully hundreds times while computer controlled team struggles find defense capable stopping you . maybe why some people prefer play online opponents . let me wrap up . this great game . graphics impressive ea wonderful job here . buy it your son , buy it your daughter , or buy yourself . you love it . i wish i could provide more helpful review . head over [ ... ] read wonderful review they gave this game . more helpful than anything i contribute	1

i bought this game because i thought it would fun play story like sims2 ds . beginning went well , operations fun . story drags little goes too slow , i actually skipped part story just operations . operations get your heart pumping somewhat stressful . i am stuck 6th one . i trying complete it few weeks now , but continuously fail . unfortunetly you cannot go any further until you complete them order . i dont know if i able play this game any further	1
king quest games classic , but why they not including king quest 8 : mask eternity ? i know it not well received when it came out ( i personally liked it ) . but just because it not well received , they won't include it . it part series , should included well	1
i played call duty 2 through through . i unlocked all achievements now i feel kind sad . i want more . this game simply fantastic , graphics gameplay . i actually felt like i thrown back time fight nazi . fire fights intense , since enemy units not retarded . they use cover effectivly even try get better postioning you . it may seem like no big deal but game developers promising smart ai years never deleviring until now . i unfortunitly not ability play xbox live so muliplayer very limited me ... what i play fantastic . its not ground breaking lack vehicles kind crappy ... but no big deal . okay ... if you xbox 360 you might well get this game . its best i played so far	1
this game masterpiece dragonball name . graphics nice , certain fighting sequences show some really detailed animation looks like they took it show itself ( they didn't really ) . you option just playing fusion characters doing fusion you don't any time limit all or you just select character itself . this goes transformations well , giant ape characters , super sayian levels ( not 4 they put goku vegeta ss4 seperate characters ) some bad parts first game don't exist this game . some characters didn't best moves list first game , like ss4 goku which he full power energy balls , super explosive wave , his ultimate 10x kamehameha wave . it also nice put some lesser known characters dragon ball universe game well ( garlic jr , turles , slug , jenemba first form , pikkon , pan , ubb etc . ) . however not every single character this game , which makes it look horrible when you play story mode . following characters not this game : gt goku ( little ) his super sayian formsdr . wheelo ( worlds strongest)gt trunks ssgt goten ssgt gohan ssgt vegeta his ss formsbio broly ( maybe we're better off not him this because i'm sure he wasn't very popular anyway)the 6 other dragonsgeneral rildo ( early part baby saga when gang m2)goku jrvegeta jrthis game half tenkaichi 1/3 each budokai games : 1 . dragon universe back but much better2 . some things exclusive game . ( first budokai , cell accidently swallows krillin instead 18 made little story ) every sayian character who armor tail ( like raditz instance ) transorm into giant ape . 3 . like budokai 2 when you first started dragon world , you selection goku , adult gohan so forth . adventure mode this game , some later chapters , they used ultimate gohan gt gohan trunks sword make it look like your playing gt trunks . this one cheesist things ever any game . this most impressive game series last dragonball game appear ps2 we heading toward next generation consoles . wii version coming out too .	1
fans this game genre always looking great fighter their console , because their comparatively far less fighting games , it quite rare find trully impressive one . tekken , however , always taken cake when it comes deep , fun , proffesional fighting experience , tekken 5 all these great qualities ? definetly . whether you're hardcore gamer or just want some fun your buddies , you've found perfect title . namco extremely fluid job breaking all barriers fighting game entertainment . there so much veriety , so much , unlock , enjoy , whether you like these types game or not , you hooked . take me , im critic , tough one matter , i can't find single thing wrong this game , other then fact online mode wasn't included . but how much it matter when you rich , deep gameplay system , extrodinary visuals , outstanding replay value , 30 , count them , 30 intruiging playable character battle master ? i say this without studder , this you playing hours upon hours friend or relative , becuase this one those games where there little more ask . 5/	1

it just like cartoon series . my brother ( 7 yrs . old ) play this game hours . i play it ( 18 yrs . old ) find it enjoyable . it gives you something those slow days . there mini missions you complete . you're given awards extras game after each completion . i'd say it 100 hours complete whole game . ( i've 60% one day ... but could just me . i normally devour any game i get . ) graphics great ; story great ; it amusing ; little too colorful but you get used it .	1
even though it costs most memory cards might seem over priced , this wonderful memory card . i don't huge collection gcn games because i prefer ps2 but i remember older model memory cards i delete old saves make room newer games . this memory card you most likely hold saves every game you own more space should left new games come ! only complaint i this memory card it only comes one color doesn't match any gamecubes market	1
i playing madden series since i kid this game really good . games just keep getting better better each year passes . everything this game worth money i strongly reccommend it	1
since there already several well written reviews already posted , i just wanted add one huge thing they've failed mention . this new version option you select swap out different players your party . this never available any other version . much like final fantasy iii ( ff6 japan ) where you comprised your team pool characters , final fantasy iv advance lets you take palom , poram , cid , yang fight moon if you'd like!there also new dungeon ( cave trials ) mt . ordeals requires you take each those characters face boss order unlock their powerful end-game weapons . each these weapons ( specific each character . i.e. you can't equip rydia palom dagger even though they're both black mages ) ultra powerful instantly makes them worthy addition your party ( especially yang ) , well maybe not edward . lolanyway , i'm sure vast majority you who buy this game played previous versions let me tell you you not dissappointed . new fight scene/magic graphics , better music , reworked dialogue unique this version , new areas make you feel like you're playing classic first time ! ps- playing this ds lit	1
i still remember getting this game 9/9/99 , day it came out . i love this game because it junction system some other cool features this game . unfortunatly , all people i knew , people either hated game ( most those people this side love/hate group ) few people loved it ( extremly hardcore rpg fans seem love it . ) . i love game but this final fantasy game whole lot people just can't stand . it long game , especially if you get stuck , so guide ( internet or actual guide i don't care ) really help . it easiest game literally reach level 100 because every 1000 exp gets you level up but using junction system also important role game because it raise your stats well . this game you play yourself . before you agree haters , give it spin , please	1
when blinx first came out , all reviews didn't really know what make it . they said this one most innovative titles come out past few years , but then they started going how hard it how it gets repetitive you go through each stage , clearing enemies proceed . well , what game isn't repetitive ? you could just easily say " all you tetris line up blocks " or " all you mario 64 collect stars " . reading time controls sounded so confusing . i didn't think i'd able handle 10 minute time limit each level while controlling time . so just week ago , i got blinx couldn't wait see how it played after countless " love it or hate it " reviews numerous people . after watching cool little intro breezing through first 2 worlds night , i saw -nothing- wrong this game . only people much trouble this those who only play rpgs or sports games , don't give platformers try . time control nothing worry either , it very simple understand , actually , you don't use time controls often . main story blinx short point . which good because i'm really sick games spending 15 minutes intros just tell you " this what going " pointless fmv . blinx quick 3-5 minute intro showing you he part millions time sweepers , time custodians clean up any problems time different planets . but suddenly , something goes wrong one them , princess kidnapped . blinx sees her gets determined save her , planet . you go through 9 worlds ( each world except last , there 3 levels , one shop , boss end ) get her back . each level , you collect time crystals gain time powers sweep ( use your sweeper/vaccum cleaner ) garbage take out all enemies level proceed next . it actually very fun i never got tired it . sweeping up different objects deals different damage enemies . garbage or flower pot won't whole lot , but beat up jaloppy , piano or even 16 ton weight , now there real damage . time crystals all over place , you gain time power collecting 3 or 4 same type . getting 3 one kind 1 any other gets you one power , but getting 4 same time crystal gets you two power . powers you use rewind , fast forward , pause , record slow motion , hearts gain you retry . if you haven't figured it out other reviews yet , it kind obvious when you need use some powers . like if you see bridge fall down , use rewind watch it rebuild itself cross . if you can't walk up river that pushing you back , rewind it so you walk up ease . if there two switches you need activate , record yourself jumping one while you jump other open door(s ) . main ones you'll using though pause slow motion , mostly because these work anything , even bosses . yeah , people go how hard bosses ... i guess they didn't figure out how use time powers . but last boss ... oh man . guy took me least total 9 hours beat . i just beat him this morning 2:59:49 am ( yes , i got exact second ) flipped out . i proud myself . he up there pocky rocky snes last boss . it like developers got mad something put all difficulty into him . because rest game pretty easy until part . side note , i love how ice levels actually ice . not magical non-slippery ice they other games . here , you pretty much skate floor if you go too fast or hit wall , you fall over get back up . it small things like make me love this game even more . graphically , blinx stunning most part . remember 10 years ago when you saw screens donkey kong country impressed models ? that what i got here . blinx himself some best graphics i've ever seen . see how he looks box ? that exactly how he looks in-game . you see fur him when he up close , they got every single detail down perfectly . every level also just much detail , there no bare areas all . there always something going . course , i can't leave out water . everyone seems impressed no matter what they think actual game . try slowing down time running through river/canal . or pausing it see trail left behind . developers fantastic job . unfortunately , some enemies don't much detail blinx . lot them just one colored shapes didn't really require much effort create . but then there some really cool design . so it little mixed bag there . last boss man , i won't even start thing . there no slowdown unless you're blasting tons garbage enemies without stopping . only other slowdown when you make it happen . it appears run 30 frames second , there nothing wrong . i really enjoyed music too , would love get soundtrack . main theme if fun enjoyable , first level contains most magical music i've ever heard . rest game good music , always fitting mood setting . final boss music really puts you mood take ' em out , it full energy concentration . sound effects cartoony , but that not bad thing . when blasting garbage enemy , you get zany little effect sounds like something tom jerry . voices however , i'm confused . they're not bad . fact , blinx great delivery voice acting not much personality ( he platformer character . he doesn't need personality ) . but i could've sworn they spoke japanese beginning . i know fact i translated some words meaning what text screen meant . but end , i didn't understand single thing . i guess they made up their own language here just like they panzer dragoon orta . but there isn't lot language going , just belts blinx most time . though he say some things english once while . i noticed " yay ! " " burned kitty food ! " when he got knocked out into lava pit . keep ear out what pigs say when you hit them garbage whenever they show up level . i swear one you fight most time goes " you suck ! " when he gets hit . it pretty intimidating hear even if you're winning . blinx didn't disappoint me all . it tons replay too . you get rank when you complete level , if you get all a+ or s+ ranks , you get cool treat . plus there cat medals each level add little bonus clips . first few pretty lame , but you get more , they turn out great . going back figuring out new ways beat bosses always fun too . i just can't stress how much i love this game . my shelf , i put this above knights old republic jet set radio future . but right behind panzer dragoon orta . what i've heard , demo sequel ( i'm amazed this thing well enough get sequel ) even better . blinx 2 probably first xbox game i get full price when it comes out . so get this if you're looking little bit " old school " feel superb graphics quality ... course fun . that all matters games , fun	1
this unique game takes keen eye ability remember small details . many times , whether or not you're successful depend how good you finding inconsistencies testimony , or things " just don't sound right " . animation very lo-tech , where each scene just stationary backdrop . if there character you interacting , they cycle through their 5 or so generic facial states it suits dialog . there * lot * reading , unfortunately , some characters love talk . music simple infectious , interface easy navigate either via touch stylus or buttons , you save your state game any time , so you take cases your own pace . it unique game just rewarding it frustrating . characters interesting , if you own ds , this game worth	1
ecellent best game ever . educational but fun . scary enoyable graphics perfect long lasting story line	1
you darkened corner . you watch patrolman descends stairs . you size him up , noticing his ak-47 drawn . you quietly sneak up behind him , when he stops walking , you grab him . you place your silenced pistol up his forehead drag him into darkened corner . guard walks into room . you quickly turn your pistol towards him , shoot , then turn back your hostage . you quickly hit him back neck , knocking him out . this great game . it made ( i believe ) 2001 , yet graphics rival games such halo 2 . physics game amazing , it very well programed . your guns drop shells , which stay ground breifly , bullets leave holes walls . guards notice you if you too loud , if their comrades sniped , they sometimes open fire , even not knowing where you . you knock out , kill , or avoid enemies . graphics , like i said , amazing . fire looks very realistic , lighting perfectly . people look realistic , not quite so much scenery , but even games like halo 2 , people not focus . missions change greatly , environments change them . dialouge isn't great , but it decent , if you dont play too close attention it , it nice backround noise . all all , if you one game buy , buy this one .	1
love this game . great story line . just make sure your computer handle it	1
my opinion , this best game xenosaga series . first game received lot well-deserved praise recognition . however , i believe this third game better just every aspect . battle system new introduces concept break . idea place your opponent state , avoiding it your characters . turn-based battle system also very quick . you don't wait 30 seconds your characters execute their battle moves . playable characters respond attack soon you choose type attack you want perform . previous games , you either fight foot or aboard giant e.s. humanoid machines . item equipment shops back , well ability customize your characters fine level . you won't much options choose first game , but ability very close . best part this game though story . i am forty years old read many novels , watched many great movies , played lots video games . my opinion , story told this game surpasses anything i ever come across . plot good . characters very well-developed seem take life you play game watch plot unfold . there action , drama , revelations just every scene . each main plot previous episodes brought conclusion . this truly masterpiece story-telling . i only hope one day , this very moving , thought-provoking , captivating , uplifting story more accessible people who don't play video games . lot people find it spiritual philosophical . yes , theme very serious dramatic . unlike more common whimsical theme most games . but trust me , you play many hours non-stop just watch plot unfold . concepts destiny , purpose , free , choices , life , afterlife , beliefs , love , despair , consequences constantly present story . central character shion uzuki , designer amazing android kos-mos . allen rest supporting cast back . this time , they out uncover plot vector could put future universe danger . mini-game there case you want take break main story enjoy fun game hackox . ofcourse , you professor , jr. allen lighten things up just bit also .	1
i always loved ea games . i purchased every single madden game since 97 every nba live game since 01 . said i see very little improvement over years . last year nfl 2k5 blew away madden so i figured i would give sega chance . after playin nba 2k6 i trully become addicted . it really sad because i skip work play this wonderful game . however many pros nba 2k6 thier also few cons . pros : wonderful graphics , superb gameplay(realistic very start)cons : learn use directional passing or ball hog because you lot tunovers otherwise . soundtrack horrible but you just put tv mute until you start playing game . dunks also not flashy nba live but you won't care much . bottom line . go get this game now . stop what you doing purchase this game pronto . if you it , get one just case one you now breaks . throw nba live trash or trade it this game . end stroy !!!!!	1

both final fantasy iv chrono trigger excellent games ( ct could my favorite game all time ) . final fantasy iv excellently restored its original " hardtype " version . story elements dialog restored , which extremely exciting . however , i complaint port . somewhere port , code saving game not optimized playstation but instead uses version works fine solid-state memory ( like cartridge , which these games originally ) but horribly when going cd solid-state . this serious flaw , saves take up half minute complete . why this game gets 3 stars overall	1
