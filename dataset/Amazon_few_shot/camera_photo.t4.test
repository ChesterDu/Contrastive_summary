amazon aggressive marketing tacticts now include shipping you goods when you called them cancel it . i never buy amazon again . i bought over 100 items over 5 years . i purchased camera 1 day delivery plan . they then just ship 4-5 day completely insensitive photographer needs . i cancelled order 2 days before it ships , they say sorry we cannot cancel . 2 days ??? come-on . i guess $3000 just creates nice interes t.t he end me amazon , i not like this kind " aggressive marketing " . good advice , rather buy direct bh photo , pay double if you like , but you get what you pay there , not aggressive marketing shoving product down your throat their terms . i am truly annoyed . run , hide .	-1
it takes around 3-4 seconds take picture after i click button !! then 8-10 seconds just store picture sd card !! so basically , i cant take picture until atleast 10-15 seconds one picture !!	-1

this my third digital camera , i bought it after my tot dunked my previous camera under water . i lot research before i bought this it highly rated consumer reports . after few months ok pictures ( macro setting not very good though ) lens cover started sticking but i learned live it . i would manually open up lens cover each time . then lens cover got stuck open position i learning live . but now camera almost completely dead . it not power up properly sometimes it beeps . i'm not sure but i think i am out warranty period this . i not buy canon camera . this camera made too cheaply . i wish things not made break right away	-1

not too long after i purchased this camera screen turned white when i turned it . i would turn it off nothing would help . finally i would take batteries out put them back . this seemed fix problem few times . after i thought it just operator error . but it wasn't . camera finally gave out white screen never went away . so after annoyed i left camera alone awhile . event came up month later . i got my camera tried turn it . nothing happened . so i changed batteries . still nothing happened . i'm not sure what happened . i believe i purchased lemon camera . i'm hoping resolve these issues samsung . it one cheapest cameras market time . so i guess you get what you pay !	-1
i bought 743 wife christmas . i 6330 i very happy . so 743 should better right ? every time she went use it batteries dead . we finally figured out new set would go dead two days without ever turning it ! after several mails they told me call service . i got someone india could not understand me i really hard time figuring out what he saying . they made it very dificult get it sent . i sent it today , but i not expect much example their service so far . i hope it comes back least .	-1

i got mine today , it returned today . i high hopes , given reviews so far supposed improvement low light sensitivity . i hoping all-in-one device stills video . here my results : 1 ) stills . pictures not too bad , but not compare similar 7mp canon sd500 which i own . zoom works well , focusing ok , but slow . pictures themselves quite bit noticeable noise them , flash or not , like they all taken high iso setting regular digital cam . so slight disappointment here . 2 ) video . if this improved low light sensitivity , i would not liked see results hd1 ! video not even come close comparing my regular sony dv camera . focusing hit or miss , shake much more evident high zoom than my sony . i really hoping all end all combo device , but hd2 neither very well . ergonomically it beautiful fits one hand very well . finish great buttons well placed . but it doesn't justify price or quality misses photos video themselves	-1
i s5000 but it dropped it broke . so i decided buy this model since i loved s5000 so much . they took away so many great options quality s5000 ... so now i just use small fuji pocket digital camera this one sits shelf . it very blurry low light very little shake control . i would suggest going s5000 even lower megapixels it much better quality	-1

i owned this sony single day before i returned it amazon . first off , it records mpeg2 format which fairly compressed , looks it once you upload your computer . it also not natively supported mac without 20$ additional quicktime mpeg2 plugin . which converted before editing . which makes it slow , tedious affair . also , included software , surprise , pc only . other problems , not computer related - chroma shift " night mode " intense , making healthiest complexions appear sickly . i'm not expectant miracles night modes , but it seems like simple solution production side(sony ) . auto white balance could also use same attention . like previous reviewer pointed out , not bad camera money if you're not serious editing you're using pc . lcd touch screen nice addition easy use . all all , i would go canon	-1
we this camera year until thanksgiving day while out town it broke . lense just froze while middle taking picture wouldnt ever go back into camera . we ran out best buy purchased it again because it just simple use basic camera me my dad . ( 2 years later old cameras lense still wont go back into camera yet camera still turn .. weird . ) first we liked camera it took good pictures . they look great when we got them developed ( costco.com best place upload them 1 hour later you pick them up , super cheap too ) quality good . within last year camera turned into piece crap . evvvvvery picture comes out blurry it seems . inside or outside . i am constantly telling people who take pics me take 2 or 3 pictures because i know one or two blurry great shot i miss because it . also flash quality horrible . it takes okay pictures people dark but if it object ( anything really , just not person ) it comes out pitch black . inside lighting bad too . camera never focus it just annoying . i also went through 2 or 3 memory sticks made sony no reason just broke . one them broke while store getting them developed ( little machine ) erased all my pictures which very dissapointing . people said there no way it their machine , it default memory stick . also camera pretty big clunky . time it actually smaller camera market , now it huge ! i am looking into now buying canon powershot 6 .	-1
my wife got this me christmas . i thrilled thought it great idea . i charged device transferred pictures it . i work technology , so i agree many other reviewers software terrible -- delete any photos , you delete them device , not software . image quality ok , but not good enough " sharing " people . after few days sorting through pictures transferring deleting them , it got bit old . other than looking it " straight-on " , nobody either side you see image . it back-lit , which fine ... but it doesn't help much . unfortunately , battery didn't last all long . device refused charge after two months , eventually it died altogether . only way make unit work plug usb cable ; battery would not charge . so i contacted " support " got basic run-around , telling me you " shouldn't charge battery more than 2-3 hours " time , i could request rma return it replacement . warranty no good , it can't returned . i'm holding onto it because i'll probably take it apart use internal parts build desktop " photocube " , so it run off usb cable . but i agree others -- even if this worked longer than 2 months -- it just novelty gets tedious quickly	-1

i guess i really shouldn't complain because my husband won camera office rally . but pictures it takes disgraceful samsung product every two three pictures blurred unrecognizably-where you can't even tell what you taken . if you found yourself among fortunate few who actually found success this camera thank your lucky stars . even if it less expensive choice versus other cameras market today spend extra money it would worth it not miss any family moments like my family , this useless piece crap	-1

i bought this camera after owning olympus digital camera years . i extremely happy my olympus , but wanted something smaller would fit my purse or diaper bag since i'm expecting . this camera such disappointment . just every single picture i took huge white blobs all over it . ( this only happened when using flash . i must admit camera takes great pictures broad daylight without flash . ) plus , if you used zoom all , pictures came out fuzzy . first digital camera i ever owned ( 7 years ago ) took better pictures ! store i bought camera wouldn't take it back because i waited two days past 14-day return policy . so , i sold camera took $100 loss . i'd much rather lose $[ ... ] than keep this camera	-1

i recently bought new celestron nexstar 4se telescope this eyepiece accessory kit . much my disappointment , eyepieces this kit not fit very well into eyepiece holder telescope , when cold ( nights colorado 25-45f ) , eyepieces not fit all . celestron customer service horrible not pay attention my problem not follow up email promised . when i called second time , they no clue construction eyepieces no thoughts how fix this problem . amazon replaced kit ( thank you amazon ! ) , but replacements not fit either . i'm returning kit too . i finally bought kit meade ( 3 eyepieces moon filter ) fit properly very easy use . fair , if these eyepieces fit your telescope then they tremendous value ( hence rating 2 stars rather than 1 ) . meade kit worse value , but because they work my nice new scope , they best anyone using nexstar 4se	-1

i read many reviews fredmiranda.com before i purchased this lens i not dissapointed one bit . i lucky enough receive very sharp copy this lens first try . macro shots very sharp contrasty . center part already reaching near maximum sharpness 2.8 anything beyond f4 tack sharp . carefull this lens though . dof 2.8 extremely narrow . don't mistaken out focus shots unsharp . focus properly crank up aperture you'll get some very satisfying macro shots . only thing i wish this lens image stabilizer . canon , how 100mm macro ?	1
this camera excellent one !! really when you compare its price its results level quality you get you know why this best its category , i'm getting very professional results using it lot styles .. highly recommended	1
got lowero slingshot 100 2 months ago , it really coming handy . main area , it holds my pentax digital slr one lens mounted , 1 rather small lens 1 decently big zoom lens ( 80-320mm ) , plus sigma ef-500 super flash . it packed there , flash just barely fits , but i don't need much more room . top compartment holds extra batteries , recharger , etc . really easy access main pocket when it my back ... just pulling case my front ( no need take it off my back ) . well made . zippers strong so i don't worry one loosening my equipment falling out . perfect amateur semi-pro photographer .	1
when i bought this camera sales people tried get me buy battery . they said one came it would only good 20 minutes . now i bought alot items my lifetime , 20 min battery camera just doesnt seem like very good " business " choice . so i said no . so i got camera , charged battery until light went green ( which sucked because i wanted play it right when i got it ) started taking pictures ( oh i also got 2g cf ) worked great .... so i planned go up mountain take soem scenery shots . keeping mind what sales person told me i pocketed charger just incase . well , 6000 ' , 300 pictures , 5 hours later camera still running strong , still 200 shots left trip home , battery life indicator hasnt budged off full button . so all all , i think battery life great , now i see if your taking say thousands pictures all row you may need but just going trip shooting few pictures every stop point , original work fine . quality photos ..... i love them	1
careful when you use this lens because it not ( image stabilizer ) so if you shaky hands exposure any more than 1/8 second you going going get some blur . this why lens so cheap . this especially bad when you far end spectrum this lens . if you really zoomed it cloudy then you should know use tripod just case . this goes any lens , but if you using 300-mm end this then use tripod . it common sense , but i've loaned out this lens they complained me afterwards	1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1

bought this camera replace my 35mm camera . am pleased trade up i made . shape similar my old film camera . thought this would make it easier adjust smaller size it . it made transition relatively smooth . i'm sure there smaller cameras out there , but this one small enough . display also good size - bigger than most i looked . i am not genius computers , so i concerned i would need adapt downloading pictures camera pc . but , all i need plug cord click button . very easy follow any instructions . i notice display " freezes " second or two after picture taken . this not generally problem me most pictures posed shots . i run into some lag time during easter egg hunt this past weekend , but still managed get dozen good shots . overall , i like camera only wish i gotten up courage go digital sooner	1
i looked this camera panasonic hvx200 , sonys , jvc 200 , even canon bigger brother x1 . i found this one fantastic reviews dvinfo.net, great video forum . my concerns 24f vs 24p addressed my satisfaction- there really isn't difference . i like tape vs hvx expensive storage solutions . one concern i , it look like pro camera ? important some situations where your equipment gives you added credibilty clients talent . soon i opened box i love ! this really substantial camera . especially opt wide angle canon matte box provided , this not look like your mama camcorder . i really like manual controls , so you don't go thru menus change parameters . layout everything great . i really like dual on/off zoom controls- top handle plus rear right side . holding handle low or medium height shots very , very comfortable controls perfectly positioned . only down side- it incidental . matte box bit flimsy- lightweight plastic . helps weight , but i worry breaking it . some may say hdv codec not good dvcpro , but my eye not see it . colors magnificent it blows away many other cams low-light . if you looking point shoot , this not your baby , but if you want pro quality camera really great price- this it	1

less than $200 this great camera . it no means spectacular , but price , it good job . i own canon powershot s60 well , canon outdoes this camera some ways , but it not pocketable . f20 easy use , menu interface fairly simple self-descriptive , it powers up ready take picture quickly , shutter lag seems average ( close s60 ) . however , only way eliminate shutter lag buy dslr . " anti-shake " mechanism not really useful all , it merely boosts iso 2000 which makes image unprintable ( least indoors ) . i yet try it this feature outside . i've also found dialing down exposure compensation helps lowlights , especially outdoors . manually setting iso 100-400 , i hope , make more printable , usable pictures . i actually thought returning this little camera , but then realized i could find nothing , price , would able compete . i really wanted 28mm lens , only found more expensive models like canon sd800is , or lumix ( which apparently tons noise low iso ) . it pocketable , portable , little tinkering you get what you want it .	1

i purchased this camera my son . he doctoral student needed photograph items his research . he able learn use it quickly . battery life phenomenal	1
reasons buy it : 1 . cheap , mere $140.2 . packed features . complete auto mode ( point shoot ) fully manual mode . 4mp 3x optical zoom good enough most situations . 3 . picture quality good . it better than other two cameras i own ( olympus c720 uz sony dsc s600 ) . 4 . compact . it smaller than it looks stock photo . 5 . fast . switches ready first shot within 1.5 seconds . other things i liked camera : - good ergonomics . fits nicely my hand , all buttons well placed easy access . i even switch camera take pictures one hand . - powerful flash . enough fill up moderate size room . - great video mode sound . it also comes audio video cable so you connect camera your tv watch vidoes pictures your tv . - lcd decent size fairly bright , which means it even visible outdoors daytime . things i didn't like camera : - manual could more detailed . there bsaic manual sort quick start guide . but there no 40 page booklet which explained each every feature detail . - auto focus illuminator ( help focussing low light ) little bright annoying sometimes . but upside you get good focus even really low light conditions . - not come battery charger . i bought rechargeable batteries charger separately . i owned olympus c720 uz newer sony dsc s600 , but i think this camera better than both them .	1
this camera very similar fuji f30 , but face detection ( fd ) autofocuses faces photo . great taking pictures yourself , or snapshots you don't time compose . excellent quality photos dim light . 3200 iso , photos washed out noisy , but still good capturing image you would otherwise miss . option limit iso 1600 , or 400 . camera use any speed up limit . 400 iso extremely good . good my canon digital rebel xti . usual modes i never use ( flower , landscape , etc . ) , but one unique mode i use all time : no flash/flash . camera takes picture without flash up 3200 iso , then takes picture flash immediately after . usually takes less than one second capture both images . no flash doesn't surprise anyone ruin candid shot , while following flash guarantees you'll get image , even if " warm glow candlelight " ruined . i always camera set this mode . uses xd cards , which i hate , but if you buy 1 gb card you'll able take 400 - 500 photos without ever needing change card . also , battery life unbelieveable ! fully charge camera over several hours , you'll able take 400 photos , half flash , before battery drained . fuji-brand underwater housing optional , watertight 40m ( 121 ft . ) camera comes underwater setting intensify non-blue colours , still keep intense blue water . literally * every * diver should one these cameras . i recommend this camera without hesitation . there simply isn't anything else like it market .	1

i see lot people trouble tracking baseballs this thing . i've owned one 3 years it works pretty well . i give some tips it : !!! if you throw respectable speed , don't follow correct procedure it not work - there no reading !! 1 ) don't stand behind metal fence . chain links plastic coating over them work , but whatever reason exposed metal interferes signal . 2 ) focus beam radar gun very narrow . whole idea keep beam ball long possible . just ball pass through radar beam not enough . you need keep beam ball practically whole pitch . 3 ) use rechargable batteries ... this isn't save money . some better energizer rechargable high amperage , 1350 ma up . gun tends respond better this , its pretty power hungry . you get more consistant readings better batteries . non-rechargable batteries cannot provide same level current ( usually 850 ma or less ) , which seem effect gun . so , how would you properly use gun ? one way stand behind mound pitcher throws . forget using it during game , behind backstop . it wont work . try line up pitchers release point plate , then situate your gun so it fires this imaginary line ( connecting pitchers hand target . you may slightly change angle gun track pitch , which slightly tricky . follow ball gun long you . sure fire way clock throw , get cheap net stand behind it . you register it every time . you also most accurate reading	1

i got this lens my 300d ( digital rebel ) kit enjoyed it ever since . solid , durable , reliable , good most light situations . lots success wide-angle landscape photos . i'm typically using this 18mm end it produced beautiful images , especially sunset indoors flash . also very light small , i just toss it my bag i'm set . pretty decent close-up stuff well like flowers , etc . overall it good starter lens if you're getting it kit , but you could probably grab it used $60 i would guess if you're just looking good all-around lens	1
great product . compact , easy use ( took couple trys ) , feels good able put two large digital cameras , four lenses room more . love it	1
this great camera . plenty resolution . excellent shot speed . sturdy frame . kit lense doesn't camera justice . buy body separate add better lense . bad side , i small glitch camera firmware soon after purchase return it fix . it two months before camera returned . sorry , canon ... you lose star	1
i keep it short sweet . very sharp - quick autofocus . i use it my canon 20d .	1
i just received canon bge2 battery grip yesterday already it attached my eos 30d ( nice ) . unit fits very well very secure . i no trouble aligning tightening grip camera body . i also found additional shutter release very handy . addition , shape unit allows solid " grip " vertical orientation well . i too already extra battery pack , two batteries required . please note unit comes canon bgm-e2 battery holder , which allows you use aa batteries . there no need buy this accessory ( unless you want second aa battery magazine ) . one accessory compliments battery grip very well canon hand strap e1 . this strap designed work neck strap yet provides added security control battery grip ( well worth $25-$30 )	1
i owned this lens year before upgrading image stabilized f/ 2.8 version . overall i very happy f/4 lens miss it available because significantly lower weight . sharpness amazing comparable both lenses , f/4 provide plenty background blur . if you shooting mostly outdoors i would recommend f/4 .	1
i bought this camera $249 new which marked down $499 retail . this older model new models just come out . money this good camera , but i am very particular not blown away . images good , but i expecting more vibrance . colors bit weak . it not take focused shot indoors unless flash , flash way bright closer shots . image often over exposed , i find myself placing piece paper over flash get more correct shot . i upgraded canon a40 2 megapixel camera ( amazing camera ! ) , images very similar quality , except new sd500 captures them bigger , 7 megapixel chip , hence little better detail . i like small size , battery lasts long time charges . holds lots pictures 1 gig card i purchased seperatly . video quality quite good still camera .	1
i enjoy i get closer shot now . its quality good . i am happy purchas	1
this same canon grip , made same factory . i don't know how they get away it , but it consumer gain here . through 2 batteries your over hundred bucks ahead --- spend all those lenses you'll end up getting xti/400d .	1
i'm not sure why " rkm001 " so many issues this product . i owned one two months now use it very heavily . it cuts straight line me everytime i never something " stick " cutting strip . i actually bought this one replace very worn ( more expensive trimmer/cutter ) i years , wish i it sooner	1
i bought my camera few months ago , so i chance figure out most its features , not all lol , but i consider good thing ( extra features means more messing around it ^-^ . well anyways it excellent camera , it all things i want it too , its half price rebel . video it takes amazing record till there no space sd card . me i sandisk 1g securememory sd card i take 27 minutes it which plenty . 38 secounds 38mb internal drive . i take 329 pictures 1g sd 10 internal . battery great it , i used it countless hours havent gotten one bar go down , so 2-3 days use run it down . so i asume 8-10 hours . i never it die me , out me intentually letting it ( i guess its better let battery run out then charge it ) focus zoom feature fun play camera comes really handy ( extra zoom there zoom button top left camera , so you really dont need buy one those cameras 10x ) what else ? well manual features ( biggest reason i got camera)so play ap ., iso , shutter speed they so fun mess , even hue photo which i didnt expect like , i actually got off really good shots . auto features come handy too , just click shoot ! macro neat feature , get close its amazing your shots beautiful ! screen good , crowd around me most still see image screen ( i take video my boyfriend friends sparing)the mic top , it its job ( when its windy you actually block wind without even knowing because your hand while " , off-shoot " button covers it ( good design)uploads pic quickly computer deleting picutres extremely quick easy . af ( auto-focus ) , focus , ae easy get quick fixs other then focus front camera . flash good . well i hope my long drawn out review helpful . i hope you enjoy your camera . i shortly purchasing smaller camera v-logs possible canon sd630 . but yes buy kodak p880 mega-pix simply amazing	1
my mom lost her usb cable her digital camera amazon always everything i need so i order it her	1
this also correct lens hood new ef 70-300mm f4- 5.6 usm lens . 4 stars because it $40 piece plastic should included both its intended lenses . shame your cheap ways , canon	1
unlike some other reviewers , i've no problems this battery ... i've it over year . i'm pro photographer , so it recharged over over over still holds charge . maybe it better because i tend totally drain my batteries before recharging ? i also use this battery dual battery grip alongside canon other off brand batteries	1
obviously , i am enamored nikon d80 . one who extensively used d100 , d70s , d200 , i curious how d80 would " shake out " comparison these fine cameras . answer it very well indeed . most obvious improvement d80 over d70s d100 upgrade 6.1 10.2 megapixels -- same its " big brother , " d200 this not major issue many users , 6.1 mp image ( uncropped ) looks essentially exactly same 10.2 mp image . however , if user intends crop images post-processing , larger amount resolution becomes importan t--t he more megapixels more detail when images cropped . shooters wildlife , example , appreciate additional resolution d80 , it often necessary photograph wildlife distance then crop image cause subject dominate frame . other very obvious d80 improvements larger viewfinder larger rear-lcd . these very welcome improvements , also borrowed d200 . viewfinder wide , bright , literal joy use . combined 11-point autofocus system ( basically same d200 although some differences options ) viewfinder makes d80 powerhouse camera moving subjects , or framing subject places other than center image . autofocus fast sure . i literally never use manual focus d80 -- autofocus just too good not use almost every conceivable situation . 2.5 inch rear lcd bright vivid -- joy use . this too , mentioned above , borrowed d200 . menu selections d80 closely track those d200 largely pretty intuitive anyone who somewhat familiar nikon system . few nits . first all , d80 not selection focus-priority continuous focus mode . this unfortunate , such option ( present d200 ) allows fast action shots using continuous-focus surety subject , fact , focus . happily , this absence ( which i predict hope nikon correct later firmware revision ) not huge loss . i shot hundreds images fast-flying birds using continuous focus d80 images almost all perfectly focused . user trust d80 continuous focus mode , focus priority or no . nikon chose equip d80 sd cards rather than cf cards . why nikon this mystery many us d80 clearly upgrade wonderful d70s , which uses cf cards . further , d80 fantastic backup camera d200 users , d200 , course , also uses cf cards rather than sd cards . cf cards would more logical choice my opinion d80 . fortunately , cost these media dropping so fast this less issue than it would few years ago . d80 sucks up power lot faster than d70s . 2.5 inch lcd entails higher power use price . most users want own spare battery . ergonomics , d80 terrific ! i just finished 8 day stay maui , hawaii , during which my d80 literally always me . weight camera low , its bulk , reasonable . there no digital slr i would rather carry extended period than compact d80 . placement various controls excellent , pretty intuitive . quality d80 body construction standard nikon-prosumer grade , which say , excellent albeit not heavy-duty metal-body d200 . overall , d80 destined become one great nikon cameras find place users all over world	1
i got this much safety anything . if i should drop my lens , solid lens hood help . plastic construction absorb some impact without transmitting all it , metal hood would . hopefully it eliminate occurances flair , although canon 50mm 1.4 lens , that not big issue begin . it also keep dust debris off lens surface if you're shooting less-than-ideal environment . it twists off lens easily . when it , it very snug secure . kind pricy piece plastic , but canon business make money .	1
what i say ? it fits place overpriced canon nb3l battery my sd500 lasts longer than oem battery . quality battery external very good . no sloppy glued edges or ill-fitting parts . battery works very well camera lasts longer one hundred or so shots . i use gig card so i tend shot alot once . even flash battery life comparable canon or even longer . i bought two instead single canon battery i not dissappointed	1
wow all there say no problems it perfect casual picture take	1
fairly decent . produces pictures optical blur edges if you use zoom . leaves black semicircle pictures taken flash 1/5 way up bottom picture because flash isn't tall enough miss wide lens . other than .. it capture few more degrees . if you going pick this or telephoto attachment , get this .	1
i used this lens over 6 months now over 1k shots through it . it fantastic others note herein . 2.8 through focus range really great . superb . vr function really neat trick . it super fun play . drawbacks size weight . after 1/2 hour shooting , your arms get tired . remember careful hold lens not camera . this lens definately heavy enough bend/warp camera body	1
this what i discovered when i've used my brand new 1d markiinwell , i say i am truly impressed this camera . friend mine got his month ago , so i played it little bit , but since i got mine thursday , i really gotten explore many features performance differences beween this camera 20d i upgraded . used few original 1d cameras , 1d mark ii , 20d battery grip 5d , size weight this camera really doesnt bother me ( i heard so many people complain size weight before ... ) i actually really like feel 1d mark ii . there only slight difference original 1d mark ii feel , but if you hold them side side you notice it . autofocus absolutely stunning . used 20d year half , i forgotten how nice it those 45 highly sensitive autofocus points ! soon you pick up this camera hold shutter button half way down , you realize why this #1 choice many best photojournalists . body construction highest quality i ever seen camera , but course very similar , if not identical other 1d series cameras . compared 20d 5d though , this thing just feels solid . stunning feature , course , speed which 1d mark ii capture images ... 8.5 frames per second ! just 1d 1d mark ii past few years , this camera holds its own all other cameras its class , 22 frame raw bursts 8.5 frames per second . i hardly ever shoot jpeg , but i test it found 48 frame buffer quite impressive . packing two 2 gig sandisk ultra ii cards ( cf sd ) i capacity 450 total shots . screen , course , fantastic , blows any nikon camera menu image review quality out water . 1.3 crop factor certainly improvement over 20d 1.6 , bigger sensor definitely yields better image quality low light due lower signal-to-noise ratio . overall , color reproduction , metering , exposure sharpness all much better than 20d . since i love wildlife photography i able get 75% more caption information than i ever my pervious camerasthe camera performs great studio , images beautiful , would expected . i yet make any photographic prints this camera , but i'm sure they look stunning .	1
i digital cameras 5 years still own olympus 5 megapixel , casio 7 megapixel . seems like megamixels alone just don't cut it me . i read rebel xt magazine looked up user reviews here amazon . i decided go buy one though i am really novice , i am extremely impressed . i never seen such stunning quality or realistic colors point shoot . i started basic settings love results . i am slowly progressing more advanced settings am getting better everyday . even novice who just wants stunning photography amazed this camera . i also bought tamron 75-300 autofocus zoom lens ( look it here amazon.com ) after lots practice , able take some great pictures . i brother uk who also into digital photography , after seeing some ( full reso ) photos i sent him , he rushed out bought xti ( called eos 400d across pond)and amazed it . i still lot learn but really cannot fault this camera . included software also excellent . record , some reviews seem think it too small hold , i big hands don't any problems all . i admit though this first slr i ever owned . i still keep point shoot keep my travel bag spontaneous photography but i am love my rebel xt !! this camera costs quite chunk change but i think it well worth it i recommend it everyone	1
ive used this product twice dont really any major complaints . my pictures came out great . i used it drag strip needed it taking pictures cars flying nighttime i able capture them nicely due no camera shake ( using tripod course well ) . only thing i dont particularly like it goes into lock position quite easily taking extra pictures arent needed , also small hole wire inserted packing doesnt really hold it well wire just kinda unravels , but i would recommend it anyone who need it	1
i received case quickly love it ! it perfect fit sd700is protects it nicely . it also nice quality leather looks nice well	1
i gave this my wife her birthday , so far no complaints all . camera plenty functions you play , but it also work point shoot situations . good quality pictures , it looks feels top notch	1
i am not photographer , but i enjoy taking good pictures . i never digital slr before ; camera i before d50 nikon coolpix ( compact one ) . i thought this would good camera someone who enjoys good pictures without pro . i realized it even better than what i expected ( maybe because i coming nikon coolpix ) . colors amazing quality picture extremely good . d50 among cheapest digital slr , , same time , it very serious product . i don't think d50 much inferior canon rebel , even if canon 2 more megapixels resolution . i used both d50 ( which i own ) rebel ( my school ) i think d50 feels much more like " pro camera " when you hold it your hands , while rebel feels more like toy . lenses provided package good , but basic . according me 18-55 better than 28-80 , but i think i should bought 55-200 well : 18 200 covers most pictures you take . also 18-135 nikon sells d80 looks good me , but they don't make kit those lenses d50 . last thing really amazes me . nef format ( nikon raw format ) . it impressive how quickly you improve . nef picture your computer just very few clicks mouse . if you want good camera , you don't want spend too much money it i think this best choice	1
it would cost you more buy these separately . battery alone could cost this much . rest accessories come handy . i originally wanted this only battery , but now , i options . great value . buy it	1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
jim . made great review ..... i just wanted let you know i agree . this great . it very light weight . only reason why i gave it 4 stars you need zoom bit or else you get burnout effect ( circle where corners dark because it getting inside lens ) . annoying , forces you remove extender when you want take closer photos . distance though , it great . pictures come out great . i highly recommend this ..... i would given it 4.5 stars if it option	1
i find these ph160 packages toner cartridges photo paper best deal me . i take lot pictures print them off send postcards friends all over usa . this way i plenty photo paper hand good supply toner cartridges don't constantly run store buy single toner cartridge package photo paper . i wish however you could just buy toner cartridges without photo paper i always more paper than what i use number toner cartridges	1
i decided get this after buying rebel xti already owning rebel xt ( this works both . ) i already corded shutter release which nice when doing long exposures or macro work where even little camera shake make huge difference . but this goes new level , you set camera up get everything focus then step back take many shots you want without any risk touching camera . make sure cover eyepiece when using this so stray light doesn't ruin your exposure . this also handy when you want take pictures you them . i even used it two cameras once get multiple angles same shot . i am thinking setting up blind setting up camera tripod try get some close up pictures wildlife would not possible otherwise . basically if you ever need take pictures without holding camera this your solution	1
this great lens . i use it full-frame film digital slrs , love getting ultrawide shots . however , if you cash , you'll probably happier 16-35/ 2.8 lens , f4 pretty slow indoors	1
i not trust any batteries except canon my canon cameras . i found " compatible " batteries not always charge incanon charger , not last long camera	1
i purchased this camera year ago ( summer 05 ) . definitely great upgrade over original rebel , although new xti larger screen which one aspect this camera not perfect . there other sites perform more comprehensive reviews this camera , but after year mine still working perfectly	1
i'm not sure why " rkm001 " so many issues this product . i owned one two months now use it very heavily . it cuts straight line me everytime i never something " stick " cutting strip . i actually bought this one replace very worn ( more expensive trimmer/cutter ) i years , wish i it sooner	1
this my second " " lens other 70-200l f4 both exceptional . if you looking professional results you need good equipment used within it limits .	1
this product served its purpose ; it same cord hooking up camera pc one came my camera	1
this good , affordable uv filter protecting your expensive lenses . i leave it my lens all time . this particular filter ( l-39 sharp cut ) especially good wide angle lenses ( lt ; 24mm focal length ) , because its ultrathin profile , which prevents vignetting . i used regular filters wide angle lenses , very bad results . although this filter not multi-coated , i not found it big deal pictures i've taken . multi-coated uv filters cost 2x or 3x price this one , which i don't think worthwhile . all all , i recommend this filter canon or non-canon lenses	1
amazon states ; product dimensions : 13.0 10.0 7.0 inchesthere no photo ( until i uploaded one ) so i thought this size stated , but turned out one little keychain bags 5x5 cloth inside . works fine , just not what i thought it , didn't want someone else think it large also . see my photo actual size next some keys . update 4/8/2006 i see they added photo what i thought i getting when i ordered .. see my uploaded photo " customer " photos see what they sent . not sure which you would get this point .. edit 07/29/2006i see now then price i paid jumps $5 $20 some strange reason .. i add it good product @ $5 but not $20	1
may i introduce you one least know yet most superb lenses canon makes . you probably even stumbled this page accident , looking canon lens , looking various macros , or even just intrigued this higher-priced lens you've probably never even considered . let me just say this this lens : ultra sharp . ultra colorful . ultra contrast . ultra solid . like everybody else , i initially bought this lens its macro . 60mm 100mm options lot cheaper , but my collection entirely l-class i'd learned trust putting gobs money into lenses red ring . so i put my money where my l-faith went this lens . needless say , my faith rewarded again . yeah , sure it got 1.0 macro capability , this important . but what i wasn't expecting image quality . it unbelievably good . now i'm not somebody who taking his first trip into land comparing this lens $300 run-of-the-mill glass . i've used six l-class lenses significantly i'm comparing this lens ' image quality those . you find yourself using this lens much its 180mm focal length f/ 3.5 aperture dictates . lens versatile both super-fine telephoto 1.0 macro . macro capability main feature . 1.0 macro literally means 35mm wide object completely fill 35mm frame . basically , it small microscope . if you dare dial aperture wide-open f/ 3.5 , dof approximately thickness two sheets writing paper 1.0 . needless say , you'll need tripod , preferably macro rails slide forwards rearwards ultimate control . ( those you new macro , focusing lens changes magnification factor . so one focuses object , object size viewfinder changes . this why i mention macro rails , they allow you achieve focus physically move lens/camera out reachieve desired composition . ) telephoto , due this lens ' superb image quality , it actually produces images much greater quality than 70-200mm f/ 2.8 . ( i know firsthand , i own it too ) difference 70-200mm versatility . if light drops too low , f/ 2.8 bests f/ 3.5 quite rapidly . if distance subjects change quickly or you unable move your feet frame images , 180mm too constricting zoom win . but under conditions where 180mm f/ 3.5 perform unhindered ( such airshow or out flower hunting ) , it consistantly produce brighter , more saturated , sharper images than 70-200mm f/ 2.8 . there complaint circulates slow speed which this lens autofocuses , expecially annoying when trying used telephoto . this actually incorrect . lens ' autofocus drive infact move very quickly , but it must traverse all way infinity 4 " front lens find subject . this where wait time comes into effect . here solution : utilizing af limiter switch allows you limit af search only infinity 5 ' front lens . consequently , this range 10% focus range ( other 90% 5 ' 4 " ) . i no longer experience af " hunting " problems when trying use 180mm telephoto . some other info this lens : front objective element actually concave . i think this only lens canon makes concave front element . it probablyexpensive replace if accident should occur , so utilize uv filter ( 72mm filter size ) . i recommend only b+w or hoya multi-coated brands . ( yes they're pricey , but worth it)the hood this lens actually little too small my opnion . if shooting backlit object , i sometimes get heavy orange glow viewfinder soi am forced use my hand " hood extender " block sunlight . its size , this lens relatively lightweight . it much lighter than 70-200mm f/ 2.8 easily handholdable extended periods time . this lens compatible canon extenders . i personally used it 1.4 extender . results excellent . while ca sharpness degrade noticeably 70-200mm , this lens shows barely difference image quality , except change designation 252mm f/5 , course . add fact macro capability now gone 1.0 1.4 , big bonus . so whom this lens apply ? -those who neither macro or telephoto prime who desire single piece handle both aspects excellent results . -those who plan performing professional product photography . -those looking into serious nature photography ( packing this lens wide-angle pretty much all you'll need day hike ) . what this lens not well : -low-light photography . -event photography . -landscapes . alternatives : -60mm/100mm : lesser image quality , less telephoto compression macro images , no real double-duty telephoto , but whole lot cheaper wider aperture . -mp-e 65mm : much greater magnification ( 5.0 ) , lower image quality , no telephoto capability , odd design means studio use almost exclusivel	1
if you intermediate level photography need camera bag strong comfortable this bag may you . i fit my canon s2is , adapter , two filters or lens this bag . this all i expected what i read this product . if you slr multiple lenses ,,, sorry ,,, you spend more bucks bigger bag .	1

manufactured soft gray felt like material , tough leather bottom , draw string closure top , this lens pouch helps protect your lens dust elements . i store my lenses camera bag , these cases fit nicely around lens taking up little precious space . this case meant use canon 28 135mm 3.5 - 5.6 usm , 28 200mm 3.5 - 5.6 usm ef lenses . these lenses not normally come case when sold new . amazon often suggests purchasing one your lens , worth considering depending how you store your lenses . pros : protects your glass investment cons : i cannot think	1
this case perfect carrying protecting my camera . can't imagine not it	1
while it isn't fashionable use anything but zoom lens anymore , this series 135mm fixed focus lens " real deal " . it superbly sharp , fast , easy use . i took it africa me astounded its brilliant clarity . great portraits ... anything requiring mid-length telephoto . highly recommended	1
i recently purchased used canon 300mm f4 it didn't case . this lightweight case perfect this lens . it fits snugly , but not too tigh t.t he case lined 1/2 " high density foam . i'm pretty sure this case would adequately protect heavy series lens 4-5 foot fall . case used my tamarac mas bag , but most time i sling lens case over my shoulder using attached shoulder strap . this very secure , reasonably priced lens case provides excellent protection your valuable lenses .	1
i am very happy gotten this flash .. it works pretty well , i like its performance	1
good quality filter set great price . i so happy it i purchased sets all my lenses cameras ! same filters my local camera store more than double price	1
i this camera little over year i still can't put it down . it wonderful . i two little boys move this camera takes their picture hardly any delay . just snap go . i bought my dad xp march he loves it too .	1
i highly recommend raynox dcr 1540pro teleconverter canon s2 instead canon branded one . hoya makes 67mm uv filter this both available lensmate.com . canon wc-dc58a wide angle converter however really good . tiffen made better one but it seems not available anymore . way , function s2 provides settings using lens adaptors teleconvertors adjust autofocus function camera necessary unless you wish try focus yourself using manual focus which , my mind , because lcd both screen well viewfinder lower resolution than optical viewfinder , iffy best . trust camera ..... it really excellent job . one final note , i would recommend using focus bracketing option lower light situations auto focus weak those situations .	1
i really pleased my item ! amazon shipped phenomenal packaging ! thanks ...	1
yes , this lens already legend , no , it not just bunch people trying justify spending whole lot cash lens . make no mistake , this lens big expensive . it not fitting into your travel bag nor it home friend party . bring 18-70mm , 28-200g or just bring cheaper ps type camera case you spill beer it ! 70-200 vr pro level lens gets almost everything right . it size byproduct optical design really makes few , if any compromises . this lens sharp ... sharp my 50mm prime sharper wide open you might believe or expect . d70 focus lightening fast quite exact . color rendition best i've seen . i much less post processing when this baby d70 . problematic side , this lens big . it heavy way , though reasonably easy grasp . i added harbortronics portrait grip handling/balance improved . it needs big bag focuses down bit under 5 feet . while it fantastic portrait lens , you need room get most out it . my first shots this lens put my more experienced lenses shame . bokeh , or quality out-of-focus areas creamy pleasing . subjects 3d quality them . vr system exactly what you'd expect . i sat my couch , framed text my dvd player 8 feet away shot f/ 2.8 iso 200 1/2 second exposure . 200mm ( 300mm d70 ) image sharp . without vr i got big blur . real question : you need 1700 dollar lens ? answer : only if you want it . quality all there level people talking this lens like it magic . i friends who shoot pro canon nikon . even canon users say 70-200vr best it kind . sell kidney buy one	1
ive gotten used disposable kodaks i got checkout isle walmart . problem those , though , they run out pictures pretty quick . last straw when we ran out film family reunion just cousin billy show us how catch lizard rubber band twinky . point i knew i needed upgrade . i ordered canon eos-1ds mark ii next day , [ ... ] feature first caught my attention powerful zoom . now when i take family picture , i like step back mile or two , then zoom snap high-resolution masterpeice . my wife always complains i zoom too close into big pores her nose , which i respond suggesting she use clean clear pore cleansing strips ( watch her upcoming review those soon ) . useful feature this camera continuous shooting mode . this where camera automatically takes pictures rapid succession , 5 per second . other day i set camera dresser , turned macarena , got wild . i then took individual pictures strung them together into animated flipbook . now watching myself macarena mere flip book away . man i dance . summarize , you lot fun this cam like i . definitely worth [ ... ] ! but remember , there [ ... ] comes it ; so make sure you fill item number clearly [ ... ] card , make sure you stay within space alloted form otherwise [ ... ] wont go through	1

i used this sb-600 my fuji s3 digital camera friend wedding . i found you need diffuser ( such omni bounce ) , otherwise you get shadows . it works great bouncing off ceiling fill whole room . this flash easy use , reliable batteries didn't die until picture #637 . i no instances it not going off when i took picture ever	1
i'm recreational photographer , i love this camera . this my 7th month beast -- since i pre-ordered it early amazon mistake . ( long story)before buying 1d mii , you should know few things : 1 . it easy overlook spec camera usb connection 1.1 not 2.0 . this 40 times slower , canon clearly intended mark ii connected via firewire . said , i occasionally use it my laptop road , which only usb connection . it convenient port there , but my 1gb cf card takes good half hour empty . 2 . time you've attached solid series or comparable lens this camera , it weighs enough lugging it around your shoulder , even without camera bag full tricks , quite burden . also , i talking professional photographer who wouldn't buy model just because cameras this heavy give her wrist trouble . if you've never held camera this size your hand , i recommend borrowing one first or checking our your local camera store , even if you ultimately buy amazon . 3 . camera conveniently supports both sd cf cards . unfortunately there no way copy two cards using camera . it not gigantic deal , but there times i wait get home trip free up sd card when i didn't camera cable , but just external cf reader . those really only 3 things i wish i'd known before i bought camera ... but would they affected my purchase ? probably not ! i said , i bought camera mistake . it loads fun ? definitely . i prints almost good medium format - 100 times convenience .	1
received some christmas cash , i put it good use purchase this lens . it works great my digital rebel certainly fine choice any eos canons . sure , it pricey little heavy , but if you want fast , wide-angle zoom lens , there little else equivalent . zoom range takes you wide scenics excellent indoor flash shots 35mm ( canon speedlite ex accessory ) . usm focusing motor quiet very quick . comes canon lens hood . don't forget add 77mm uv filter protect optics full time !	1
i bought this camera my wife christmas 04 ' i thought i ordered it too late it arrive time christmas , but these people great ! they got it me time we love this camera we use it all time - we several accs . item it quality picture wonderful . thanks mark christian	1
let me first start off saying - long time canon user . i own 6 or 7 lenses , including three series lenses , this far one my favorites - if not my absolute favorite . i shoot mostly glamour erotica type work 20d . so right there , this lens not true 15mm me - but 1.6 x15mm . it sharp tack . it light weight . it very short ( i call it nub lens ) . it autofocus amazing . very little barrel distortion ... highly recommended . this lens probably sharp ( if not sharper ) than my 24-70 2.8 or my 17-40 4.0 lens .	1
i wish there also photo showed backside this camera case . if there i would known this excellent quality case unfortunately not belt loop which what i looking this product . great quality nevertheless	1
though lenses my nikon d50 not expensive some they still several hundred dollars this uv protection filter protecting lens glass made whole lot sense . i feel less stress when i clean filter lens than if i wiping dust dirt actual lens glass . this size , 52mm , what specified my d50 it fits perfectly , it should . i no complaints all manufacturer or seller . if you new digital slr like i then get this filter protect your lens . spend your time worrying sensor when you need switch out your lens .	1
i not repeat what other reviews stated already , all reviews below pretty much correct this camera high quality easy use etc etc . only issue focusing small target such name brand logo inside rolex watch . it hard even manual mode ( i actually alot digital camera experience ) . forget trying focus auto mode , it won't happen .. least not without alot tinkering stress . if you need take alot close up pictures small detailed items ( jewelery , insects , etc . ) then i recommend buying digital slr camera , nikon d50 good one ! this fuji you looking here perfect taking pictures normal things like people , cars , buildings , sites , etc	1
i always used third party lenses before but after trying this canon i say i am impressed quality , it feels like solid piece equipment rather than hunk lightweight plastic . i find my photos much sharper due lens itself . i tremors my hands so difficult time normal lens but helped tremendously . i like range zoom it pretty much all purpose me ( used kit lens only once since i got this lens when i needed wider angle ) . i could occasionally/rarely use little more distance but nothing perfect . my only complaint lens heavy pretty much doubles weight my camera ( rebel xt ) . you know it around your neck after few hours shooting . i haven't any focus hunting problems , which i constantly 3rd party lenses . lens very quiet which imo good thing . reasonably priced lens it well worth money	1
i no investment dslr but narrowed my choices canon 30d nikon d200 . i always wanted nikon . d200 definitely joy hold it take good pictures ( i tried both camera store before i bought 30d ) . i lot research ( more than i care admit ! ) there no conclusive evidence one camera clear edge over other . depending your specific needs , one camera may " slightly better " than other . after trying out both cameras , i convinced 30d good fit my needs d200 . " value money " 30d clear winner over d200 ( i got mine when canon cash canon promotion going ) . also , beginner slr i found 30d its fully automatic scene modes easy start out . i don't expect use scene modes or full auto mode after week or two . i expect quickly graduate creative control zones . but use family camera , quick scene modes very helpful . if you expect use it more professional basis it'd probably not matter . additionally , when i checked it out store , i noticed canon 30d focused sharply almost every time . d200 not least few times . i'd take this grain salt though since it brief trial store . but i thought i'd share my experience . it may just anomaly actual equipment i tried out . i still find nikon d200 great camera ? absolutely ! i regret bought canon 30d ? absolutely not ! decision swinger my case really " money factor " . i more than willing spend up $300 more nikon d200 . but when difference became $550 it no longer became justifiable my christmas gift myself :-) my purchases included canon 30d [ ... ] , canon 17-85mm ef-s usm lens [ ... ] , sandisk extreme iii 2gb compact flash card [ ... ] i plan add external flash this soon , consider eventual lenses after i determine camera long-term keeper .	1
i my research before purchasing this particular frame found lot praise philips brand digital frames . i've not dissapointed all ! it really easy set up photo resolution incredible . i actually bought kodak version originally , returned it because it seemed low quality . philips major upgrade kodak	1
camera works fine i record performances various bands i play . sound ok ( just remember keep your fingers away mike ) , it records fairly well most nightclub situations , but if it dark , video dark well . usb connection great thing , but remember it needs disconnected via software before you jerk camera away computer . i damaged hard drive my very first use , now i only record 16min . video before i'm full . it my fault	1
i love this camera . so far its best digital camera i've owned . only problem this camera it eats batteries like crazy . its best buy rechargable batteries so you dont spend so much money	1
initially i wary after reading few reports this case may leak , but so far i no problems all . i tested it 12 feet bottom my swimming pool ( 1lb lead weight inside make it sink ) then took it 130 feet several dives following day my trusty s400 camera . great pictures , clear video , what great product . my dive buddy taken his over 200 feet it still works fine . only problem may finding source replacement o-rings .	1
canon powershot a540 6mp digital camera worked great right out box . it very easy use delivers great pictures . view screen very large i really like option using view finder take pictures . i took 330 pictures my first set batteries came camera . price point $175 , i not think there better camera market	1
i use this filter my nikon n80 . works great . under $10 , this great buy	1
this just worked . no other way say it . needed protect my hdr-hc3 during some planned water shooting while windsurfing cape hatteras . figured less than $200 , this worth shot . never got open box before trip , but took it anyway , just case . temptation too strong , i decided go field . managed configure camera housing front seat my car beach , close it up , shoot some great water video 20 kt day canadian hole . too cool . only two minor issues , neither worth star ... 1 ) instructions where/how mount camera housing little tough follow . only because sony put one set directions like 50 different languages very large fold out sheet made very lightweight paper . didn't help i trying it car cold hands windy day . but still , directions not all ergonomic . functional ? completely . user friendly ? no ... 2 ) reflective viewfinder worked well enough , but you shield ambient light or you couldn't very well see what you shooting . admittedly , this extreme test environment bright mid-day sun surface water lots reflection due wind wave action ( including lots'o'whitecaps ) . mainly requires adjustment your shooting posture , specifically put your face up against housing , which little awkward first , but then completely endurable ... added bonus , which surprised me : audio take while housing quite good . conversations those filmed observers nearby completely intelligible . didn't expect , but very pleasantly surprised . means your color commentary continue unabated ..	1
i digital camera owner since 640x480 days when digi cams size bricks , now i one that small deck cards ... sd300 . i've it almost year now , it keeps kicking . i read all reviews cracked lcd screens all , but i took my chances anyways ... quite frankly , screen itself taken beating me , it all scratched up my pocket , banging around my keys coins , etc . i applied thin screen protector it fixes cosmetic blemishes ( added scratch glare sunlight ) due scratches . picture quality awesome , i've made large prints costco they look immaculate . i use 512mb sd card which able hold around 200 pictures " superfine " 4.0 megapixel mode ( there 3 modes each 4 available resolutions ; coarse , fine , superfine ) . it durable too , i've dropped it numerous times , it still works beautifully . metal casing doesn't only look good , it truly serves its purpose protecting camera vital internal components . i don't see myself buying camera long time i usually make 4x6 8x10 prints , which come out great images taken this camera . size adds even more incentive one buy this camera or any powershot sd series , it allows one easily slip it into their pocket or purse . one then whip it out , power it up , ready snap photo under 9 seconds ... seriously . power-up load time extremely fast , even faster if you buy sd card faster write capability . also , i able purchase extra nb-4l batteries this camera pricegrabber.com only $4.99 piece , can't beat . i'd give this camera 6 star rating if i could =	1
this camera great ! it takes amazing pictures incredible quality . videos it takes equally impressive great zoom clarity . this camera absolutely perfect college or any recreational use very easy use . i actually needed head shot audition i set automatic timer take picture myself cropped it . when i picked up my pictures , lady working said i needed copyright release form because pictures looked too professional . she finally gave them me , but i guess proves camera takes professional quality pictures	1
i every friend amazed capability this scanner . matter seconds i plug usb my macbook pro just press button scanner it starts immediately . no waiting , no heating up lamp , etc . it scans all documents no matter side you place it , adobe pdf software ( included ) automatically flips page if you placed it wrong side few seconds it job . you get character recognition pdf so you search words inside pdf , even osx spotlight , you find everything ! both sides page one pass . i'm very happy this new hardware ... ive it 3 weeks i scanned shredded 500 pages . 500 pages few hours work no more storage my office ! all sizes papers accepted , i scan every voucher my credit card i get my shopping , invoices , mail ... everything ! i believe every office find it extremely helpful you happy you got it . i forgot price once i enjoying great uses it . welcome future every office . tip : it takes some patience get this amazon . they get it sells out stock matter hours . check frequently you get it	1
camera works quite well , what says it ( senses movement then blinks red led while swiveling back-and-forth ) , very low cost . it actually * * look like small , low-cost surveillance camera . only negative aspect you relatively close " camera " ( around ten feet lighted situation ) make it activate normal ( not exaggerated ) body movements -- it won't trigger all low light situations . all-in-all though , great buy device may prevent burglary your home or apartment	1
this product so cool . whatever your situation , if you lot digital pictures , then i recommend going out getting sd card ... preferably up 1gb ( or even 512mb ) , use this this product . even if your camera doesn't use sd , you plop sd card right into picture frame upload photos your computer card ! it like little computer , this frame . big suggestion i find program online resizes your photos dimensions frame ( photo size explained other reviews ) . ( i downloaded visualizer photo resize ) . this take photos down its original size ( e.g. 1.8 mb ) smaller size ( e.g. 500kb ) . this let your store dramatically more photos . so far i fit over 1700 photos 430mb worth 1gb sd card i ! picture quality very good frame swivel basically any angle could used horizontally or vertically . plus , it philips , which great brand . i philips hd tv well it my baby ... i love it . this great present anyone ! how you go wrong picture frame replaces its picture any time you want	1
i found no problems these binoculars . well worth small amount money spent . images clear , focusing very simple . great buy someone not wanting spend ton $ .	1
i used this cannon a85 . it worked very well . i got some nice shots kennedy space center ( where you cannot always get close sites ) . shortcoming when camera low magnification ( zoom level where standard lens would work ) , shot not fill up screen . it like you looking down tube . so if you going back forth close shots far away shots , you need change lenses	1
i bit worried first tiny size , but it tres powerful ! i bought it school trip amazon forest i sighted way more birds animals than everyone else which helped get me course . yes , these binoculars rock !	1
i purchased optional weight kit my wp-dc80 underwater housing ( canon sd550 ) . following instructions make camera housing neutrally buoyant , i attached one weights tripod attachment spot botton housing . it worked perfectly	1
this product all it claims it doing excellent job me . there just no other way photograph highly polished silver or sparkling stone or crystal jewelry . because camera stationary position all pictures same size proportion ; product doesn't appear larger or smaller than it actually . attached carrying case tremendous convenience keeping all components together when not use it very easy set-up take-down . i bit hesitant choose this seller because theirs lowest price ; however , quality exceeds my expectations . postage very minimal i received equipment within 2 days purchase . so , needless say , i am very pleased both seller product .	1
i purchased this camera 2 or 3 years ago , still use it if brand new today . this camera excellent amateur hobby photographers like myself , it lot functions accessed click dial , such shutter speed , aperture priority , manual function , etc . honest , camera so many functions i don't even understand how utilize it its full potential . if you well versed photography , this camera you . if you just point shoot kind person , this camera too many functions it wouldn't worth it . i purchased 1g memory card store over 1000 pictures ( camera comes one only saves like 20 photos ) . software easy use nice photo viewing editing capability . only caveat size makes it too bulky take everywhere so it only used planned outings , not something you carry around you daily , thus stripping you your random photo op . one other thing i trouble if settings not perfectly adjusted some low light situations , pictures come out blurry . but it take really great flash photos some settings make night look like daytime . you really just play around settings if you amateur like me , but once you get hang it , it awesome . i love this camera quality photos near professional .	1
it very disappointing 40 pages paper only able print little over half number cartridge comes it . i now three unopened packages paper i no cartridge . i think we should able buy just cartridge when we need . it sure would nice . why i am only rating one star . otherwise , it would five .... thanks , marsh	-1
we bought this camcorder 2006 , it perfect us ! hard-drive store many hours video zoom great ! 12x zoom so good 1mp still shots actually look somewhat impressive ( but don't get rid your digital still camera ! ) i can't imagine how awesome 25x zoom must new 2007 models . dcr-sr60 easy use , so don't worry if you're not very tech savy . it simple transfer video hard drive pc , not too tough burn video onto dvd external dvd burner . our only complaint it sometimes takes second or 2 color adjust when light changes , video look little funky during those times . we don't use camera dark areas much , so we've happy overall performance	1
i used this product few months now . i like fact it uses sd card technology . i simply remove card read pictures my card reader . used it college football game last weekend it worked great . i could see close ups players even take some action pictures . it take little practice keep action shots blurring but they appear working fine . shots band nice clear . it would nice if you could see actual picture you taking but probably taking technolgy place this price point won't allow . i also like way they knob adjusts people shots distance shots . still experimenting see when use which adjustment . quality fine they appear sturdy waterproof which help when working them outdoors where binoculars really designed used . i'll grant camera probably not one professional photographer would like but price get binoculars camera together they good product good bargain	1

some years ago i bought canon rebel , one earlier ones , it not so great , kept if while then sold it . i into digital some time now , but , its great , but it not film , not any chance . i very old point shoot , i started taking pictures either kodak fuji film , i then brought it into my one hour developer negs developed digitized onto cd . results gorgeous , point it time new slr , there not so many left right now . i saw eos rebel t2 28-90 mark iii zoom lens , it impressive , light , but just touch heft , great grip , viewfinder , very fast autofocus , it even looks great . so forgetting my previous experience rebel long time ago i bough t.t his superb camera , this just no way praise it , i love this camera . since getting it i , ve shot 10 rolls film , all digitized onto disc , touched up where i felt they needed it , ( simple procedure . i shot roll hanger former naval aviation base here , all kinds aircraft different stages reconstruction , it photographers paradise . results i am getting better than very expensive digital camera . i cannot recommend t2 even more , if you want one get it now , i think these cameras gone soon . canon you great job .	1
this awesome piece equipment ! this cam produces some most stunning video right now price deal decade ! dvd format outstanding it really best both worlds . i use -rw discs copy my video my computer then reformat disc ( which takes 7 seconds ) use it over over again so price media virtually nothing , unlike tape which you keep buying buying . other benefit unlike hard disk based cam i dont worry drive filling up while i'm vacation no place offload video . unlike tape based cam i dont all problems associated tape like head cleaning trying dig out tape wrapped up inside cam or endure hours tedious capturing or properly tension tape before use or how big box i need store all those old tapes or worrying recording over something i already shot . i could go it but tape just old unreliable pain rear . you tell i bad experiences tape based cam so enough . avchd codec very efficient you 4.5 gb per hour video compared 13gb per hour video tape based hdv cam it records audio dolby 5.1 surround which alot better than stereo only you get hdv . others mentioned short recording time i suppose it may issue someone but it not me . think it when you watching tv or movie how many times cam just sit there pointed one thing without break longer than minute ( or even few seconds) ? there nothing i think i record more than 20 minutes ( hq mode ) straight i would want sit down watch anyways . now if you record something like childs school play sure maybe couple times your childs life you need hour shot but i dont even if event took say 1 hour straight it only takes 15 seconds change out disc recording again so 1 hour i would change twice miss 30 seconds video , not big deal . most all stuff i shoot like 1-3 minutes tops i'm next scene . i shot wedding i able get all it time bride walks time couple walks out all 1 20 minute disc . i think most people complain short recording times just lazy change disc ! far video noisy low light well give me break , it but so every other cam priced south $ 3,500 . 00 ! besides they make these things called lights ! daylight there no noise all video when played back my hdtv , just beautiful high def video . bottom line me this cam far best bang buck available today . nothing this price range even comes close video quality this cam produces . it snap record brilliant video transfer it computer . editing options limited right now but they exist more way so editing thing non issue well . it pro type features just not found other cams i especially like manual adjustment ring i would never own cam again not least 3.5 " lcd screen . used smaller 2.7 " screens before i tell you big screen way better especially when you trying manually adjust elements like focus exposure . big screen you actually tell what your video look like , small screens just dont show enough detail . this cam also takes beautiful still pictuers , i could keep going but truth i really enjoy everthing this cam offer i would not trade it anything else	1

waist level finders always appealed me whether using slr or medium format camera . so when r1 combined waist level capable finder giant cmos imager wide zeiss lens , i give it try . i am not disappointed . while it not fastest focusing camera out there , it great anything short quick moving subjects . images sharp , sharp , sharp . image stabilzation would nice , well faster focus . but even these shortcomings .. r1 worth every bit its price . am now hoping r2 upgrade r1 --- it like white rice	1
this battery getting hard find . i found just wnat i needed . good price delivered time .........	1
anyone who says this isnt great piece equipment talking complete rubbish ! price size it excellent . good quality stills camcorder when needed . yes , if you want very small very high quality camera - then simple , buy camera ! but 2 1 this best market . i took my one first real use disney , florida recently it lived up all expectations easy carry , all i asked i came back some very good shots ( 482 ) great deal footage which easy play around through my pc . 99% shots perfect good my small canon sd400 . yes , year or two i am sure something better around ( previous reviewer says ) but isnt there always ??? go it	1

friend work just asking advice camera she early digital compact very un-user friendly . conversation inspired me post review this camera so easy use takes fantastic photos . pros : - easy use- picture quality great- video pretty good ( not amazing but better than most out there)- size good - not tiny but not big quality you get- stylish ; looks nice- you buy waterproof casing itcons : - only thing probably case all compacts its not super fast taking photo . if you used slr this little annoying but overall its not great problem something you get used automatic focus . i've very very happy this camera using it travel family shots . thumbs up	1

display this digital frame crisp bright , displays photos fairly well . i would consider 800x600 minimum resolution screen this size . i intend use this displaying pictures only , i didn't test video or music functions . initial settings annoying ; thing automatically started slide show random cheesy screen-wipe effects , file information permanently on-screen . i changed settings manual slideshow only , no info display , long delay , full-screen transition only . location buttons frame mean you can't see screen buttons same time ... given inclusion remote , this small issue . buttons oddly placed , though ... left , right , enter , up , down . this straight line left right ... not exactly good interface design . menu options comprehensive surprisingly feature-rich ... no complaints there . included colored frames okay ; my opinion , black looks rather flat bland , while cherry-wood colored frame gives whole assembly more interesting look . card support this frame excellent ; support all standard card types , including xd , definitely bonus my book . included leaning stand sub-par ... it basically gives frame bent plastic peg lean , angle adjustments limited . option hang it wall welcome , but then you're stuck problem what big wall wart end power cord . hopefully this specific my particular order , but when i opened this up , frame looked dusty dirty , there clearly visible fingerprints plastic screen cover . round plastic " seal " box untouched far i could tell , but i suspect occasional refurbished item may slipping into packaging line . plastic cover meant removed anyway , everything seemed working fine , so i haven't bothered seek rma	1

i owned this camera now month since buying it here amazon . it great camera i am very happy it . photos it takes amazing . video also very good . it also very easy operate . only thing downer what others wrote lcd daytime , it hard see when its sunny	1
performance viewing stabilization very good . this 3rd pair these binoculars i used stabilizing mechanisim what stops working . i use these employee abc sports college football so they get quite bit use - but it also major problem when mechanism stops working during broadcast	1
i think point lot people not mentioning d200 quite obvious . let me first say main reason i bought d200 over d80 increase my credibility prestige amateur photographer , make other photographers jealous my kit , brag obscene amount money i spend camera equipment while my co-workers can't even pay their rent . i bought grip because i thought it looked really cool , it increased size visibility my camera other people . question really sold me d200 : strangers i might want photograph more likely say yes standing other side d80 or d200 ? people less doubts me holding this thing opposed smaller model ? which one looks cooler ? if i completely loaded would i buy d2xs ? without second thought . course i talked lot camera people making minimum wage hoping they would some technical insight purchasing nikon or other camera . course they let me down said lot bogus things me most saying something like : " d200 way much camera me . " none them knew how change exposure settings , they contented wheel " child mode , " top d80 recited this me several times if i looked like soccer mom . usual i offended human experience buying real world , especially atrocious mark up several hundred dollars , i refused help pay those employees wages . breaking point i think time associate instructed me buy one camera over other because , " when she dropped this camera it broke other one didn't . " so i turned internet where i only say hi ups man he leaves . i studied studied all things technical , sometimes just staring pictures cameras long periods time without blinking . i poured over thousands photographs taken all kinds cameras amassed photographic library while i decided . basically i went way overboard let decision buying camera engulf my life until i dreaming it . so one night i just bought d200 after fence over d80 or d200 . after two days it arrived i impressed it . thing literally cold hard photographic machine . after broken d50 i firstly impressed size , then secondly all dials switches change things i used dig through menu get . thirdly i liked blazing fast 2 frame rate . when i go out night i snap 50mm f/ 1.8 onto it crank iso up . lot people forms complaining noise high iso d200 but i thought it fine . i feel most people camp want perfect clarity all way up into highest isos but i think artistically limiting . i read one scathing review written veteran film user saying basically high iso digital lot less graininess than film basically saying d200 step up but some people still want complain . far d200 goes versus d50 iso 1600 it leaps bounds better my opinion . noise way reduced without nr there isn't pixel chunkiness i found d50 high isos . thing stands out d200 enhanced colors . reality ultra vivid setting d200 makes lot things look sort fake , but it make people who don't sun tan look like they one which plus my opinion . it make your dull green lawn look like lush paradise , skies ultra blue , reds spectacular . i remember when i used d50 i would steer away photographing violets red roses because it would blow them out , not so d200 . some reason coming point shoot it always used annoy my d50 didn't bw or sepia . d200 bw but no sepia . nerds forums would just say , " use cs2 , or photo editor , " but i say no because i should able everything camera . viewfinder so awesome . i literally hated electronic viewfinders d50 viewfinder so small it hindered my framing times . d200 big bright viewfinder huge lcd sucks down batteries like nothing . far my evolution goes photography sometimes i feel like i literally climb into viewfinder because its so big compared what i used . like i said grip awesome i really like it . i kind like many accessories possible kind steered me away d2xs into d200 . watching percentage marks count down batteries drain always fun . best thing d200 little things like because they make me feel like i greater control over my pictures because i know exactly how many i take . conclusion buy d200 over d80 i am really happy it i am not happy anything . if you're trouble considering what you want photographically try pull yourself away forums outside sources really consider what got you into photography first place where you intend go it , i think important part . advertising gear collecting never made anyone better artist	1
you better money . image quality below average low light really bad , even novice camcorder . i'm glad see price come down . camcorder not come software needed capture video or even play dvd my computer(it really should ) . i would more research choose camera right you . i found many online camcorder review sites very helpful . i returned it bought panasonic 3ccd technology . it much better picture quality . if you want really good night vision go sony . i would not recomend this camcorder anyone	-1

i looking prime wide angle my nikon d-50 settled sigma 10-20mm instead . used it trip spain shooting close interiors architectural shots well landscapes . worked well nikon d-50 . photos sharp - good image quality expected distortion 10mm some vignetting when used lens hood . best quality 14 20mm . this lens great addition . i used it together " normal " 18-70 70-300 ( tamaron ) . these three lenses all you need when road . one major annoyance cheapo lens cover kept falling off . useless . all all good choice get decent wide angle digital	1
this good scope well known brand - night owl , should work well most . i prefer it cyclops well - it much nicer shape	1
i just purchased this unit found it extremely useful course . i " shaky " hands distance it difficult view flag distance but i've found if i use scan mode just scan area flag i view flag second it give distance which all i need . other items like bunkers , trees edges water , it breeze . it light easy use .	1
this tripod stable , fairly light remote controls handle perfectly interact my sony hdr-fx1 hdv camera . using lanc connection i zoom out variable speed / start stop camera without actually touching camera . well worth money !	1
one best investments i made . well worth cost . adds enjoyment game . would reccomend all - easy use ! very accurate	1
this little beauty really everything it claims . there so many shooting formats you spoilt choice . only problem i there so many formats it take me lot practice able pull fast point shoot anything other than normal light . i tend better less choices but many people undoubtedly love it . however , internal guide very helpful -- it choose format you need if you few moments consult it . its size perfect body feels good your hand . huge viewscreen size . 1 gig card extra battery , i'm set travel	1
after reading every review i could lay hands , i finally took plunged ordered this amazon . all i say , reviews not kidding , amazing deal . quality eyepieces surprised me this price , i especially like 32mm eyepiece , great field view !. case solid , extra room more bits i get them . i haven't tried filters yet , but even if they half what they promise , everything else box i am very happy	1
this not case frills . camera fits snugly inside but there no room anything else such battery charger or even case memory card . it feels flimsier than i expected but so far i no problems workmanship , so attribute may just my interpretation .	1
this charger great , well worth extra 20 or 30 bucks it costs over knockoff . 1 . it small , it plugs right into wall , plug prongs fold . 2 . there no brick end cord truck all over . no cord all actually . 3 . you know it quality , wont damage expensive batteries . you spend 40 or 50 bucks battery , then go ebay find cheapest pos charger you find . they dont charge well , quickly , some batteries , they just dont charge all . this charger charges all batteries i much better charge , 1/4 size . this one small enough go right into my camera bag . love it	1
i really like this camera ! it fairly simple use , takes great pictures packed features . it fits nicely hand compact enough slip coat pocket or purse . we bought this camera our daughter birthday . she using it ease especially loves movie sound option . my opinion , camera winner any adult or kid wanting good all around digital camera . my only negative it battery hog . most digital cameras , you want make sure you get rechargeable batteries large memory card	1
i would like seen it constructed out heavier material but i also guess it would cause price go up .. but tell ya what , i love my equipment !!!!!!!! great job i would order this company again ...	1
i this over 6 months now i cant really complain it . its compact easy use . however , people glasses would trouble using it . i use it without my glasses(there power caliberation you match ur eye power ) then its very clear . easy carry around solid . very good its price	1
this great board cam light . it great use same batteries your camcorder ( fp series ) , although you need use least fp-f770 ( not original comes cameras ) light both bulbs . it just great	1
this high quality product . i experience military used third generation nvg many many times while driving humvees night w/only nvg night vision . this product comparable military nvg/s fraction cost . second or third generation night vision cost you thousand/s dollars minimal return performance . later generations last longer course , due first generation tubes burning out somewhat quicker than later generations . if you factor how many first generation units you could buy second generation units this mute point . later generations allow viewing longer distances lower ambient light levels however . majority people however , first generation acceptable . when you pick up this unit you feel quality . it all metal majority " armored " quality rubber shell . controls easy use , ir effective most uses . it comes w/storage bag , nice bonus . it uses 123 series lithium camera batteries longer run time longer storage time . they expensive however , 6-7 dollars apiece . there some distortion perimeter your viewing , but small price pay price/performace this product . whatever you buy this product , whether viewing wildlife , security , or just cool gadget around , this finest first generation night vision product around . yes , amazon best deal you find . usual , fast shipping excellent service w/amazon . when second/third generation products come down price , i first buy one , until then however .... this simply finest you buy . only complaints i w/this product omission tripod mount it seems they could designed battery compartment latch better . minor details otherwise excellent product . kudos night owl amazon	1

some years ago i bought canon rebel , one earlier ones , it not so great , kept if while then sold it . i into digital some time now , but , its great , but it not film , not any chance . i very old point shoot , i started taking pictures either kodak fuji film , i then brought it into my one hour developer negs developed digitized onto cd . results gorgeous , point it time new slr , there not so many left right now . i saw eos rebel t2 28-90 mark iii zoom lens , it impressive , light , but just touch heft , great grip , viewfinder , very fast autofocus , it even looks great . so forgetting my previous experience rebel long time ago i bough t.t his superb camera , this just no way praise it , i love this camera . since getting it i , ve shot 10 rolls film , all digitized onto disc , touched up where i felt they needed it , ( simple procedure . i shot roll hanger former naval aviation base here , all kinds aircraft different stages reconstruction , it photographers paradise . results i am getting better than very expensive digital camera . i cannot recommend t2 even more , if you want one get it now , i think these cameras gone soon . canon you great job .	1
i purchased this product because my last digital camera zeis lens took great pictures . i am thrilled this camera . it takes such crisp , clean clear pictures . screen huge so easy zoom in/out side side . there so many cool features camera itself no need download computer make changes . battery life seems last long time . you also capability save pictures camera itself without memory stick . i think it only saved 5 pictures but it nice test . i disappointed memory stick i my previous sony camera not compatible this camera . i bought 2 meg pro card it holds tons pictures . battery needs charged outside camera not directly while camera . camera isn't cheap but it well worth every penny picture freak like me .	1
i use this my olympus e-500 it works perfectly every time . i'm not going get into much techie stuff here , but if your fence this flash , don't . buy it , it works great	1
i own two these little cameras . first purchased work i liked it so much i purchased one family . second one i purchased ( christmas 06 ) already bit dust ! not long after , 1st one started issues . i sent 2nd one repair over month ago haven't heard word ! not sure if it worth sending 1st one or not .... not mention support their website joke time waster !! if you buy this camera ... hope you better luck than i ! i've canon slr over five years it never any issues or malfunctions !!!	-1
usaul , just wish you could ship direct me holland . i it sent my daughter us then forwarde	1
this good case , but i would prefer one it little bit small , because bulky . but overall , very good adquisition people wants take underwater photography	1
after reading horror stories underwater housings , i decided spend extra little bit get brand name kit well kit made canon ( same maker my camera [ a610 ]) . i careful read follow directions , but could only test it my kitchen sink . so , little confidence , i took it caribbean last week sank it 15 feet half hour . i impressed kit worked perfectly . not single leak or anything . i ended up taking it out three different days clean all salt water sand each night , but long i keep it clean lubricate gasket each time , i'm hopeful it give me many months/years service . my friend calls it " chick magnet " ? i brought it me margaritaville grand turk after snorkeling got lot attention	1
i lot research digital cameras before making purchase . probably 50 hours [ ... ] [ ... ] price checks 10 different websites asked everyone i knew what they liked didn't like their cameras . i am so happy i picked this one . it very lightweight yet durable , sleek attractive if that what you want . large viewfinder great asset . great zoom capabilities although i say picture quality ( screen , anyway ) somewhat compromised ( gets little grainy ) max zoom . i probably only use 6 or 7 " best shot " modes regular basis but it fun experiment them all . very long battery life . i took this camera 7-night cruise didn't recharge it all . i 2 friends who ready buy new cameras they going get this one	1
this camera great . it got really clear images , i like macro feature so much . lcd screen very cool .. it big clear . only con size camera little big compare some other brands like sony . but overall i like it lot	1
i lot research camcorders , i mean lot !! i spent weeks reading all professional user reviews , which left me even more undecided then when i started search . i finally narrowed it down canon elura 100 zr 850 . elura discontinued therefore difficult find reasonable price , so i chose this one ! first all , zoom works well this camcorder . it very powerful , image stays fairly clear until you reach 80% zoom . motor noise not bad , it not noticable all if there other background noise . image quality good , just steer clear low light situations . image gets very grainy low light . size this camera very nice . available features suit me very well . overall , this good camera money .	1
pretty good small bag . although little tight camera body since it positioned near top where pack curved , there plenty padding tight fit not cause any harm camera . pads wear little fit gets better over time , so this not really big deal , but it make me worry initially . padded velcro dividers bag positioned just anywhere make any combination compartments . bag also ton extra pockets compartments able handle all my storage media , cables , batteries , etc . i room camera , two other lenses , lens hoods inside . i am still trying figure out if i include my compact conventional film camera bag somewhere . great thing design pack bag readily accepts other velcro attached accessories water bottles , film , or other gear . i may see if my other camera fit way . there two issues might problem . 1 pros bag too small handle larger lenses professional gear . 2 beginner it 1/2 size regular backpack not convenient plain 35mm camera case if you just headed out family picnic . one general gripe straps defninitely pain those prefer carry it tote rather than wear it . they not detachable . if they , this would nearly perfect my needs . said , i'm pretty happy it i won't looking any other cases	1
pretty comfortable . could more practical couple inner pockets	1
it original nikon , so no qualms swapping it battery came camera while one recharging	1
i received this christmas present . this digital camera works fine still shots , pictures my family , etc , but action shots , kids playing outside , basketball games , etc . it big disappointment . i took 47 pictures my son playing basketball our school gym only 5 them worth keeping . i've taken several games/activities try it out . i've tried using different functions , adjusting manual setting , playing zoom but nothing worked . many shots blurred , shadows ( because movement ) , or so dark people can't seen . i wish i would known this before i asked this camera .	-1
i deal major brand cameras panasonic cameras my personal favorite ! i've seen people whine " noise " they make many times but never found it problem . i own fz10 fx01 my personal cameras . fx01 very fast camera takes great pics ! i love 28mm wide lens . compared most cameras i've used fx01 real good job metering light exposing images . i love panasonic solid build reliability . they may not popular canon or sony but my opinion every bit good .	1
i bought two these dock kits christmas gifts my mom grandma who received cameras gifts earlier year . great prices dock kits too . dock great people who trouble getting pictures off their camera onto their computer . or those who always take their camera drugstore retrieve edit their pictures ! i'm very happy this purchase	1
sony wide angle works advertised . i am very happy it .	1
this second time i bought this item , great quality not too big . good one	1
i went canon batteries charger avoid any problems canon digital camera they used . whenever i've used rechargeable batteries electronic device , they never seem last long enough . so camera , i went same brand batteries . i've taken probably 100 photos , use flash zoom often , camera almost two hours straight photography class batteries still don't show any loss power respect camera battery status indicator . since this kit comes 4 batteries , i always 2 charged spares . maybe cheaper rechargeables would work , but it wasn't worth risk hassle if they failed right when i needed them	1
i older model this wanted upgrade . i love both them , but am very glad i upgraded . pictures clearer . i love casio cameras . small , user friendly , holds up well . great all around	1
this pouch nifty real cute size . i'm glad i purchased it	1
i olympus 770 sw ( not 720 sw ) , sure ... i like it . i five digital cameras before , this one terrific . considering it sub-compact pocket camera , image quality fine ( not equal digital slr , but i don't want carry around big box like dslr ) . shadow detail especially impressive . operation smooth intuitive . screen fine , even outdoors . shutter lag , big concern mine i like photograph my kids sports , minimal zero if you prefocus . number custom scene settings impressive . i bought it because waterproofing shockproofing , because prior good experience olympus over years , but i'm just happy pictures it takes under normal circumstances too . few gripes stop me giving camera 5 stars : 1 . battery cannot recharged when it camera . total $80 or so , you get external power source cable , together they let camera run long time without draining battery , but they don't charge battery . battery life fine day normal shooting , but if you use camera actively , every single night you pretty much unlock case , take out battery charge it , then remember put battery back next day . each charge takes 5 hours . i'm going take same $80 instead buy two extra batteries comfortable -- one camera , one reserve me , charging home . even so , it take some planning thinking keep batteries ready all time vacation . it would much nicer holster or charging socket case . 2 . case actually smaller than it needs . it could significantly bigger still fit my shirt pocket , which my standard size requirement . it , advanced engineering impressive pack all features tiny box , but camera more expensive than need , lens smaller than it should ( depending zoom position , lens f/ 3.5 f/ 5.0 , which pretty weak ) , it harder hold camera than need , if case bigger , there would room nice little charging socket too . 3 . there indeed background , almost mechanical noise introduced when filming videos . it probably filtered out , it very constant very low pitched , but it mildly annoying . 4 . time shots too long -- it takes several seconds save each shot full resolution . 5 . you use internal memory only if there no memory card slot . given slow transfer speed card , it sure would nice able save dozen or so shots very quickly internal memory then transfer them memory when you time . all , though , i'm really looking forward using this camera forthcoming sea kayaking snorkeling trip this summer . one camera , i'll able take snapshots above below water , also modest videos underwater ( there special scene selection just )	1
tad hard get into out ... but high quality quite protectiv	1
this very well made camera case - fits our finepix s3000 very well . its only drawback , one which clearly identifiable its picture - therefore it no surprise us , it no storage space any batteries or other items .	1

i purchased this camcorder just over two weeks ago must say i am more than pleased w/ its performance . after reading countless reviews camcorders handling several local stores , i selected sdr-s150 based : - size - reviewed video performance - sdhc recording format i wanted camcorder very compact so i wouldn't mind carrying it anywhere . size average digital camera , sdr-s150 fits bill nicely . video performance very good . able pop sd card into card reader my computer makes transfering videos pretty much effortless . this camcorder costs bit more than others out there , but i feel extra $$ well spent due it video quality , ease use expected durability . since it doesn't tapes jam or hard drives crash , it should long life v.s. other units . one concern i prior purchasing this camcorder whether it could used indoors , reviewers said it suffers more than some low light situations . my concerns put rest after seeing my first indoor video . it works just fine under normal indoor lighting . concern i whether i would enough recording time using sd cards . happily , i find there little if any difference ( my eye ) best quality medium quality modes . i tend record using medium quality setting , giving twice recording time over highest quality setting . my 8 gig card = 4 hrs recording . i highly recommend this camcorder if size video quality matters you .	1
i bought this my teen age daughter xmas , she loves it . it easy use takes super great pictures . thanks helping my make her happy	1
i think it very much worth it , function dollar , i listen loud music , i am very active , i use this mp3 , snapping photo my buddies , lithium ion battery lasts while what i use it " go " when i plug it into pc it charges i load photo so , nice . i purchased previous version they took quite beating . i stick this brand camera ease use . it going no directions , read up advanced functions . i say they great job . only con little door connector , seems flimsy , but even my abuse still there . if you own one , you know	1
