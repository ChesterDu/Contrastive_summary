my first impression unit very rugged nice looking . then i tried use it . i mostly bought it altimeter thermometer . first day use i just ran out patience plan return it . here problems i altitech21 . most time buttons work fine , but several times i pressed mode button mode not change . 2 . when setting declination page 25 manual states you press set/reset/light reverse digits , but soon you press set/reset/light button unit ends calibration mode . 3 . temperature stuck 87.5 degrees hour after purchase . finally after cycling through mode buttons temperature instantly dropped 81.5 degrees . i held unit front ac vent car until car cooled down 70 degrees , i suspect air coming out vent actually cooler than 70 degrees . temperature display never budged 81.5 degrees . 4 . i constructed rudimentary chamber placed altitech2 unit digital thermometer chamber . digital thermometer registered 78 degrees , altitech2 registered 81.4 degrees . i blasted hot air chamber hair dryer . digital thermometer quickly rose 116 degrees i turned heat off . altitech2 stayed exactly 81.4 degrees . after removing chamber altitech2 slowly increased 94 degrees , went down 92.6 degrees stayed there good 5 minutes . despite room temperature 78 degrees . 5 . compass only stay 10 seconds , then display turns off conserve battery . this never seems long enough get good fix while using reference map . when display shuts down you need press start button again turn display . since this button recessed , you reposition your hand press button your fingernail ( i ) . this moves compass relation map again very frustrating constantly press start button . i'll stick my 19th century compass now . this unit might worth keeping me if altimeter reliable , but after all other trouble i i not even mess setting up altimeter i lost confidence device .	-1

if you're looking here you're obviously interested playing better golf therefore you need own this . jim hardy figured it out . forget everything else you heard golf swing listen why proper thing : - take club inside up backswing , - keeping clubface closed until you reach top wherein you rotate your forearms make clubface open , - downswing you need keep your arms behind you ( some might say " stuck " ) , while simultaneously " coming over top " get club out front your body , - swing well your left complete through swing ( i.e. never " down line . " ) yes , this sounds like exact opposite everything you've ever heard . but then again employing your current method you truly satisfied you getting most your abilities ? most cases if one honest answer " no . " so it stands reason your technique wrong instead blaming yourself it time give hardy " plane truth " try . addition video series which amazing , i would also recommend both hardy books essential material . you want get them all keep reinforcing proper fundamentals since each subtle differences description new drills , you're more likely find keys really make difference you	1

if you trying decide wood or foam yoga block , i highly recommend foam blocks beveled edges because they very comfortable . when you pressing blocks , they firm enough withstand your body weight , but not overly firm so they make your hands hurt pressure . blocks tend encourage proper form because they allow you slowly work into poses provide needed support when you can't reach floor pose . lightweight blocks easy move side side they work extension your arm . there many ways you use these blocks once i started yoga step step workouts/yoga practice sessions , i found i really need buy softer yoga blocks try some more advanced positions . ~ rebecca review	1

i purchased coleman exponent f1 ultralight stove this past spring preparation trip cascades oregon . i owned liquid fuel stove years ( msr whisperlite purchased approx 1992 ) , loved it , but i am getting older , i wanting trim my pack weight down . i found following advantages f1 ultralight . #1 . easy use . simply unscrew burner head , open pan supports , screw burner head back down , screw stove onto canister , light match , twist valve , you cooking gas . #2 . no priming . liquid fuel stoves required priming , pumping , which made them harder use than i would expected . this stove , you simply turn valve light . no waiting generator heat up . #3 . very light weight . stove assembly itself weighs less than just small fuel bottle my liquid fuel stove alone . this thing feather back . disadvantages there well . #1 . canister stoves rely low boiling point fuel force fuel vapor up out canister , temps close , or below boiling point , which close 0 fahrenheit , stove simply not work . me , where when i camp , this not issue . #2 . fuel cannot used emergency fire starter . #3 . fuel expensive compared white gas , or unleaded gasoline . owners manual claims this stove only works coleman brand canisters , but i found any threaded canister 70/30 butane / propane blend works . i used brunton , coleman , msr , some odd black canister i bought gas station oregon it , all excellent results .. compared other canister stoves such msr pocket rocket , brunton optimus crux , snow peak giga power stove , or primus yellowstone techno trail , coleman exponent f1 ultralight design made most sense me , sported lowest weight ( . 4oz lower than its nearest competitor ) , what i able determine impromptu store testing , appeared best pot stability group , pot supports spread out nice wide . one tidbit this however ... evernew 1.3 titanium cookpot , oddly shaped bottom , sits slightly odd angle f1 . i tried many other pots this only one i problem . issue whith oddly dimpled bottom evernew pot , not coleman stove ... summary . if you camp where temps aren't freezing , low weight , ease use important , cost fuel unimportant , then this stove you . however you must carry some other sort emergency fire starter lieu stove gas start wet wood . if however cost fuel going factor you , or you going go mountain climbing , or whatever , you want bypass any canister stove all , just go gasoline model instead . coleman f1 ultralight lightest group stoves i considered , best design , came price point i liked . majority backpackers out there , i would say this would best stove you .	1

my boyfriend took this last year wrestling season lost fifteen pounds without all altering his eating or exercise habits . athlete , he always gets huge amound exercise practice , lifting weights running daily but eats whatever much he wants . he started bottle weighing 195-200 6'1 '' ended weighing 178 . he maintained this weight six months too , proving it wasn't just water . he experience pretty bad side effects , however , point where he said he wouldn't take product again or recomend it anyone . taking suggested 4 pills day , he felt constantly sick , like he " all life sucked out him " actually vomited twice- pretty gross . anyways , because significant results he experienced , i've always tempted try product myself finally picked up bottle last week , my boyfriend dismay . so far , i haven't felt sick or shaky all , i think this because my daily dose ritalin all but completely numbed my body effects weaker stimulants like 200mg caffeine contained this product . i also unfortunately haven't noticed any weight loss , this may same reason :-( i'll report back when i finish bottle	1

i would actually give this product 4.5 stars since i am very happy it . only negatives small plastic piece broken upon delivery actual instructions use table very brief . assembly breeze ( broken part aside ) , constuction this table very solid . terms use , i'm little embarrassed say i burst blood vessel under my eye second day i used it , because i inverted too long relaxed position . it hurt couple days annoying , but not serious . treatment my neck back pain , however , table great . just 4 or 5 minutes day really seems help . key watch how pressure inversion feels tense your facial muscles accordingly concert other movements keep your circulation moving . don't just hang there like bat .	1

my lifetime , i probably built 14 halfpipes least 25 quarterpipes . problem i live ohio weather ruins them every year . i prefer quarterpipe because it not too obtrusive you more time prepare tricks . one biggest challenges making good quarterpipe getting bottom sheet lie flat riding surface ... especially after few rainfalls warped wood ! i hesistant buy this ramp because i never physically seen it . i watched videos read some reviews , but reviews not really give mouch specific info ... hopefully , this one ! ramp 9 foot radius bit under 3 feet high . although this sounds kind weak , it actually fun ramp . curve deceptive . if you look each panel , they almost look flat , but when you ride it , you get nice lift . its not vertical , but you airs . transisition gets you 70 degrees coping excellent . it metal fairly burly . lip tricks very fun this ramp . material ramp abs type plastic ... it not rot . i leave my ramp out rain . no issues all ramp , although there some rust coping ... i may need rpaint it , but if you grind daily , it takes care it . i am big skater ... i am 6'1 " over 220lbs . this ramp holds me ease . it never slid i drop it , rock rolls , 50/50s ollies . ramp give bit landing , but not changed its original form . top deck rather small , but it support 500 lbs allows lap over grinds . bottom ramp formed piece metal which allows smooth start ramp ... i love . ramps seems bit abrupt first , but you get use it . so ... here pluses minuses ! plus- easily taken down folded away winter ... or set up basement ! - riding surfcae fast smooth . - you link more than 1 ramp together ... fairly seamlessly . - metal support top notch all connections welded . so much nicer than wood transitions screws ! - surface ramp piece excellent ... very smooth . - it loks professional . i live nice neighborhood . i peeled off freshpark logo it looks lot less obtrusive road . minus- expensive . i bought 2 ... - not very wide . one unit only 4 feet wide . i bought two hooked them together form 8 foot wide ramp . when i just rode 4 footer , it not so fun ... not lot room . adding second ramp made it who new experience .. more room rock solid . - wheels it rolls complete garbage . i cannot believe how they skimped this . i looking replace them . they plastic no bearings ... not take any abuse . $400 piece , you think they would give you quality wheels . - ramp loud . much i love bottom piece metal allows smooth transition , it make loud clanging noise after repeated rides . i don't really mind it , but i am not sure if my neighbors thrilled it ! - heavy . this good bad . it very solid , which awesome , but when it folded up its wheels , it very heavy .. 150lbs (?) it tips easier than it should . if child this fall him , it would not good . unlikeley , but i it tilt few times i moved it . i strong enough correct it , but kid could problems . - potential theft . i think they should provide bar you attach lock so nobody fold it up take it your driveway . i bolted together 3 major bolts , so theif would work get it ... but if you only 4 footer leave it outside , it would take minutes steal . i love ramp . i looked long time ramp would allow me skate whenever i wanted , but would not require me rebuild every year . good quarterpipe costs $200 make . you relaminate every year paint etc ... this far best solution once i rationalized i would skate it many years . those plastic ramps total garbage ... i never even considered them . i hope answers any questions ramp . bottom line it costs lot money , but it best value if you want this type ramp .	1

nutshell : super food supplement like brewer yeast or lecithinover 5 times more monounsaturated fat than polyunsaturated fat ! -- -- over 20 times more monounsaturated fat than saturated fat ! but that not all --- golden flax seed ? nutritionally complex food . flax seed contains very high concentration alpha linoleic acid ( ala ) ? omega-3 essential fatty acid ? plus fiber , lignan many naturally occurring vitamins minerals . increasingly , recent studies revealed flax seed help reduce serum cholesterol levels , fights cancer controls blood glucose levels . it important buy whole flax seeds then grind them : buying flax seed unground , keeps it fresh , retains all nutrients while shelf . however , it important grind flax coffee grinder before using , otherwise flax seed most likely pass through your digestive system intact , you not received benefits consuming them . it important avoid ground flax , since no matter how wholesome , fresh flax when it ground , it loses its nutrient value , turns rancid very quickly , even when purchased vacuum sealed container . essence , vacuum sealed container only useful if you use all flax soon container opened . course assumes it sealed soon it ground first place . fyi - traditionally , " golden flax " higher oil than ordinary yellow flax which traditionally higher fiber . bottom line : one several brands i consume dailythis " now golden flax " organic food supplement which enhance human health when used daily , truly excellent value .	1

first all , i never body max 1 . so , i don't way comparing this what cathe already area . secondly , i didn't entire video once because it just too damn long . i skipped step section beginning cardio blasts , then went back them later premix . however , this fun workout gets job far weights cardio . honestly , my favorite part this video warmup . i really good time step portions warm up . yet , all cardio moves fairly simple picked up pretty easily your first or second try ... especially if you know cathe " usual " moves . hard enough make advanced exercisers sweat , but easily modified those aren't there ye t.t he best part any cathe video premixes - her videos shockingly long me , but i always find mix gets me what i want amount time i want it . i definitely recommend checking this video out	1

title pretty much stands my review . when i first bought it , i thinking , " this prolly some cheap piece chinese plastic break after 5 shots . " well , plastic part right , but 120 shots later this thing still firing like like motha ! larger-er gun . not like desert eagle or anything , but reasonable size . mag doesn't fall out when you press butting , but its not impossible reach up remove mag . base line : buy it . even if you don't think you need it . resell it some kid ( like myself ) 10 bucks . or keep it use it back-up warfare	1
i bought this because i don't like doing situps much . my feet tend move around then pretty soon i am flopping around floor not really doing any good . this solves all . you just slip it bottom door your sit-ups it . then you fold it up after use it almost completely out way . it holds your feet really well , allows you sit-ups lot easier ( well sit-ups still hard ) . it lost star because when you using it , if you putting lot pressure bar ( which you shouldn't ... but if you get tired , etc ) door pulled out . if you solid door this wouldn't much issue . also when you fold it up , bolts touch door , it possibly after it awhile you could put little dents/scratches door . overall , it makes situps pleasure again	1

suitability these gloves depends what type lifting you enjoy . padding palm fingers , your entire gripping surface cushioned . such padding common bicycling gloves where hours continuous pressure vibration cause numbness pain . yet , most serious lifters would probably forgo comfort better control provided unpadded gloves . traditional weight lifting gloves made durable but supple leather prevent calluses improve grip . latter becomes critically important when perspiring . my experience , no padding best - especially when lifting heavier weight . basically , compliance padding reduces your level control . same time , there undesirable absorption energy , albeit miniscule amount . quality materials construction harbinger 1250 gloves best i seen . clearly , expense making these gloves significantly higher than other products i owned nike gold . unfortunately , generous use thick split leather padding provides insulation causes excessive heat buildup . heat comes sweat . i find myself taking these gloves off multiple times during my workout let sweat evaporate . it would nice if there perforations or large vents back mitigate this problem . while these gloves might ideal certain lifters who prefer comfort over control , i would counsel gym rats purchase other gloves less or no padding . kudos harbinger making quality product , but these gloves aren't everyone . prossuperior materialsexcellent double stitchingcomfortable wrist wrapconsexpensiveexcessive padding no perforations dissipate heat perspiration	1
i lot reading all major jogging strollers . i 50 miles week , also own babyjogger , which i also like very much . this one our vacation home , so i didn't want spend $300+ item i would only use par t-t ime . i also didn't want size b/j , which quite long too big our little beach condo . but i wasn't sure what expect cheaper jogger . i say , this wonderful item . it just light b/j -- which real help since we also carry it up down steps -- moves almost easily . built-in drop-down rain shield real help given miami frequent showers fast-changing weather . sun-bonnet huge , very important all harsh sun down here . it very ** comfortable run or walk , maneuverable enough we even use it our regular out-and-about stroller . it assembled easily folds up pretty well -- yes , you remove wheels , which pain , but not big one . fully adjustable handlebar great , esp . since my partner i half-foot different height . my only complaint they cheap-out make you pay extra $13 storage net underneath , don't even really one fit this model -- this silly omission any item aimed serious or even semi-serious runners . but all all we're very happy it , price right , it competitive baby jogger . b/j definitely faster , but not much . i would definitely recommend this model if you want high-quality jogger budget any consideration	1
i've hooked flashlights going four years this light may ultimate culmination flashlight development driven good folks candlepower forums . i've spent up $350 flashlights frankly don't what this one namely , offer insane amount brightness out such small package . three brightness levels two strobe levels easy user interface , making this little sucker work piece cake . i believe low output setting offer something like 21 hours usable light , imagine some kind disaster need really long run time . i'm writing few my impressions because i become burned out flashlights until this one came . imagine out dark forest you hear sound , you flash your light 75 yards down trail , you light up bear then you make run it . it got two strobe ( one fast , one slow ) positions both useful emergency situations where it important attract someone attention , this littls sucker it all it literally disappears into your pocket , or you use handy belt holder it comes , what bargain . case you wondering , i don't work nothing fenix other than owning two their lights	1

cyclists recognize headlights roughly placed into two categories : ( 1 ) " see " lights provide sufficient illumination actually see where you going avoid obstacles , ( 2 ) " see me " lights really only seen front . i commute hid light much brighter than this one , but i like backup light , also like flashing helmet mounted light i point any direction get attention motorists , particularly those approaching me side . princeton tec light one few led lights i've enountered truly qualifies ( albiet , barely ) " see " light . highest setting , it produces very well collimated beam just right intensity width make it suitable night riding reasonable speeds . light less suitable medium setting , unsuitable purpose lowest setting . i same gripes kent this light . ( 1 ) it should designed use aa batteries . if it made use aa batteries instead aaa batteries , light would only marginally larger heavier , but burn time would greatly extended ... enough make it suitable ultra cycling events . ( 2 ) duty cycle " flash " mode too low . light would far more visible if flash rate increased least factor two or three . those complaints aren't knock effectiveness light itself . just suggestions improvments could make great light even better	1

' bubbles ' child back therefore out way . unlike lifejacket , this not allow child just float . they need keep moving therefore actually learn swim , first " running " water then stretching out normal swim posture . once child progresses his or her skills , ' bubbles ' halved reduced until child swim without any help	1
owning 2 ripsticks kids our household not enough : my husband i also hooked ~ ~ looks like we'll need 2 more . fun , fun , fun . best smooth surface- indoor tile or concrete , not black asphault . highly recommended ages 10-100	1
i borrowed one these campout high wyoming mountains . we large group sleeping out open . i recently purchase my own because i liked it so much . trip " burrito " consisting my sleeping bag , wool fleece blanket covered small tarp . this little baby underneath . not only it provide comfort hard ground , it provided protection keeping me off running water ground when hard rain started pelt us 2-4 hours . i think convoluted water resistant design this helped . except little bit water top opening my sleeping bag , i dry , one very few our large group . most other people drenched .	1
i purchased ripstik let me tell you , best thing ride ! whenever i go down street everyone stares ask what it . they all say they want one too . best thing all riding hills ! i even go up them but when you go down its like snowboarding . i recommend this 100	1
this belt much more comfortable than those full-back styles . it seemed too skimpy hold up my large frame water , but worked great ! i got model 4 floats , but smaller adult could probably use just 3 . this very good value	1

i found it $30 cheaper site . i liked reviews here shopped around found better deal . once it arrived , it great machine . took hour or two put together , not big deal . i took it slow patient everything fit properly . quality excellent , not thin tinny parts , but solid machinery . it whisper quiet , so you enjoy television while rowing . it small when wide open , arms fold back even farther easy storage . only problem data panel -- booklet instructions some inscrutable language , so i never learned how use buttons panel . that ok , though , because it gives you elapsed time number reps , i don't really need lot more data when i'm rowing . also , data panel kind slides top machine sits your knees . if you bump it while rowing , it get loose or pop off . but overall , this excellent machine , well worth money	-1
i bought two these canopies use outdoor craft festival , after my canopy rentals fell through . purchasing two them turned out cheaper than renting , anyway , so it actually made more sense purchase . when they arrived , they came nice , wheeled carrying cases easy transportation . they went up very easily ( once i figured out mechanism , which took all 2 minutes ) remained standing throughout 6-plus hour festival . they sturdy well made , , ultimately , i highly recommend them	1
this monitor basics some advanced features . i like alarms when i go out my set training zone . logic set up different screens takes some getting used ; just keep using it it make sense . i one workout where heart rate skyrocketed didn't read quite right , otherwise it worked perfectly . i use it biking running . only reason i didn't go 150 because i already bike computer i like .	1
quality this item acceptable . it looks like it hold up well . i never actually shake it , because it gets shaken so much during delivery battery it pretty well charged up . far brightness , i would say it bright aa battery flashlight . everyone should one emergency , because it always ready go you not go looking batterys it . you light so you go looking better flashlight :) i look around auction sites found one they selling slightly better price . it make good gift because people not seen them before . they usually real happy say they put it glovebox or whatever .	1
this tv wrist watch more like wrist tv rudimentary time/date piece top . tft active matrix color ( that right , color ! ) screen measures 1.5 " diagonal . there no speaker " watch " ; instead , you listen via included special earphones . earphones special because cord also acts tv antenna , so order watch tv this thing , you must use included earphones . i got mine website called shentech dot com . ( i'm * not * affiliated them any way . ) just sixty nine bucks only ! you should know nhj went bankrupt last year , that why tv watch clearance now . what pity . it so cool ... yeah , it really cool able watch tv watch . tv runs off built-in liion rechargable battery which last over hour , probably close two hours . recharging battery takes around 90 minutes when connected ac . you also recharge battery using four aa batteries ; or you power tv using ac or four aa alkaline batteries . tv watch really comes two pieces : tv unit , ugly plastic base wrist strap attached . but nhj also includes neckstrap , very thoughtful them , watching tv your wrist get tiring . problem , reception just not good . no , you can't hook up cable or dvd this . you just live over-the-air ( ota ) broadcast signals . earphone-antenna rather weak picking up signals . it helps if you situated close tv broadcast towers or live high floors . reception also very direction-dependent , sometimes if you hold earphone cord your hand it may help . overall , reception tv quite disappointing , but works if you willing experiment different positions . tv tuner tune channels 1 64 , but due reception limitation , you proably just get few channels look acceptable . me , jerry springer channel appears best , so i watch 2 hours jerry springer my wrist every day . not bad . anyway , this absolutely coolest gadget world , price really great . just don't expect warranty repairs if yours breaks	1
