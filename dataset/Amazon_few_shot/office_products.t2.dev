these notebooks seem like pricey investment but they're well worth it . i use mine meetings , journaling , sketching out ideas . not only it sturdy enough take beating , but it touch class legal pad can't match .	1
i couldn't believe what hard time i trying find small , hardback , unlined notebook book-like binding ! i'll admit i bought this product because it only one i could find fulfilled these requirements . but i am extremely pleased overall quality this notebook . i am using it record my favorite quotes it perfect purpose thus far . only downfalls i say may stem fact i am writing it fountain pen . ink tends " vein out " bit if you i can't write both sides paper because ink too dark . otherwise i love appearance both cover paper . i can't speak how it handles sketching . i also like small pocket inside back cover . shipping it bit pricey , but definitely great product	1
x-pad decent piece equipment , doing good job keeping my laptop getting too hot . my only issue it lack padding underside . i'm going attach piece neoprene or something similar make it more comfortable my lap .	1
this product best ! it so simple use- no heat- no thermals- just simple turning crank . simple often better definitely case here . i use tool laminate spec sheets selling high end sports cars result super professional . i suggest also getting paper cutter staples because you may want trim up end product .	1
these add hour or more playtime your electronic devices , but not help mechanical devices motors things . i don't understand how they work , but my rio 500 they give me 2-3 hours more playtime . they very good buy all digital things such camera flashes mp3 players , but not worth money older discmans other highly motorized devices . they more circuts better . this also known name titanium virtually identical duracell ultra batteries	1
i purchsed this use multiple moleskine notebooks i use . i bought one try , buy more keep them all my moleskines . pen sturdy , big enough fit comfortably my hand , but small enough clip onto notebook spine still fit easily pcket . great product anyone who needs carry pen , but can't or doesn't want mess regular sized pen or pencil . stylus tip back end nice pda users well	1
i love this set cards . so many beautiful , unique cards really make impact . organizer such great concept used forever ... just go out buy new cards replace those you've used category . reviewer reports , there lack " male " cards most cards feminine side ... but probably more telling population gives cards ! i bought my set costco where price much lower , fifteen dollars ! great deal if you able snag them there	1
i bought cross pen , when i ran out refills , i went local store sold cross . they told me i could use brand ink everything would just fine . well , it wasn't . it wrong consistency my pen ran ran . so , i finally found these my pen right rain now	1
what it designed . i think mainboard could made material , such plastic . current material deform humid conditions , if under some weight or pressure	1
free batch great ! specialty cards 3-d designs . original cards okay , but not private greeting card quality .	1
this inexpensive way store lots cd , including those computer . this box heavy cardboard , covered waterproof vinyl , folded when delivered snapped together . you can't stand one , but these boxes still quite rugged -- least strong plastic . single box hold 30 cd full jewel cases , 60 cd slim cases , or 165 cd envelopes . that lot cd not much money . i started three boxes am now buying them dozen . you'll find lots uses them .	1

i use fountain pens everyday , so i know what i am talking : this great fountain pen everyday writing -- one you not care gets lost or damaged due its very low price ( unlike average ( non limited edition ) fountain pens , which cost over $100 -- sometimes much more ) . pilot varsity pen lays down great fine-to-medium line ink , nib ( ie : writing tip ) not dry out too fast when left uncapped -- pen seems write forever its large internal ink reservoir . fantastic buy ; no muss-'n-fuss refill pen either !	1
just wanted resonably attractive storage . these trick . ordered six none defective	1
i original version these pens , love them , but this one even easier write . i learn write my off hand due nerve damage , but this pen i write my primary hand . this pen , my off hand writing more legible too ! winner all around	1
