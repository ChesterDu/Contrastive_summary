michael moriarity my hero ! he just one coolest actors my opinion . he such great b-movies this , , it alive 3 : island alive . how awesome he ?? anyways , i think this movie hilarious ! i think lot people take this movie too seriously , thinking it going your typical movie . but you shouldn't because not only this b-movie , but it supposed funny . my favorite part when " stuff " started bubbeling out ground old hick guy just starts eating it . who would ?? i just started laughing butt off when happened . so if you watch this movie , just sit back enjoy it what it worth , don't too critical it . what i learned stuff : dairy products evil ! especially if they come earth ! if you like stuff , i recommend : watching other b-movies , such island alive 3 , zombi 3 4 , etc	-1
it time someone make strong pitch hollywood new version " fahrenehit 451 " . although i appreciate what truffault trying accomplish back sixties , movie just not hold up well 2007 , particularly when shown high school classroom . advancements cgi could transform bradbury novel into very frightening exciting thriller . my students spent more time laughing adaptation than appreciating it thematically . said , book gained value exponentially them because movie didn't satisfy their understanding . lose wires jet packs !	-1

ok , so i am not big vampire movie fan , so maybe something fact i thought this movie sucked . but i am always open minded all sorts films , so i thought i would give this one whirl . it started out some potential , but within first 20 minutes i knew it going hopeless . i should just turned darned thing off . it so unrealistic ( ok , i know it vampire movie , so what i expect ) but i just didn't believe main character ( kerr ) would things he ended up doing thru out movie . then girl ( izabella miko ) who 8 lines movie ; just lame pointless . she must felt like such loser telling people , yeah , i'm this movie " forsaken " , i'm it almost entire time ... but .... ahhh .... well just call me zombie girl . anyways , i highly recommend pass this one , unless you complete vampire fanatic	-1

" world according garp " my top 5 list favorite books all time . it one those rare books makes you laugh out loud , but still really feel emotion characters , story really sticks you . ( i made joke ellen jamesian just other day , lol ~ yes , it dumb joke no one else got , but , that how it goes sometimes :) i introduced book college , well after book movie released , but i never heard either one . i read book just couple days ~ i couldn't put it down , i chatted it up everyone who would listen . i've re-read it several times since then , i still think it terrific . naturally , when i found out there already movie . . . i thrilled ! i ordered it right away . . . but i wish i'd never wasted my money . it own , movie might alirght . but when you're invested book , when you know characters , robin williams just isn't garp . i love robin williams , he great comedian , that not question . i just think casting this part way off base . if you can't believe main character , rest it crap . if you've never read book , i highly recommend it !!	-1

i don't usually make point watch films this bad ( predictable plot , laughable dialog , horrible music soundtrack , etc ) , but when i saw my all-time favorite actor jeremy brett brief but memorable role " shameless " ( originally titled " mad dogs englishmen " ) , i couldn't resist . it bizarre experience witness actor -- who so perfectly embodied iconic sherlock holmes beloved granada tv series -- appear such odd role drug-supplying sugar daddy . it even odder see glimpse him modern-day sexual scene young woman . regardless , usual , he stole movie even if he only barely it . i only wished director used brett his fullest talents instead aside eccentric . young elizabeth hurley makes mediocre attempt portray bored little rich girl drug problems . thomas howell his best seem sexy grunge biker kind way . but brett booming voice , subtle expressions dynamic presence wakes you up just long enough pay attention his character . once he disappears screen , you realize all too soon rest film worthless . it takes great actor lift up role muck , i'm sorry see this brett only chance modern-day storyline his usual historic epics before he passed away . he briefly commented interview why he role , soon realized film disaster . " mad dogs englishmen " ( 1995) -- " i mad it , but i wanted show world i still alive i could other things apart sherlock holmes . i hope they don't release it ... "	-1
im not sure why i gave this second star ; maybe its because i feel guilty always loathing everything john malkovich associated ? directed written spike jonze charlie kaufman ( same duo who gave us equally pretentious " adaptation " ) , this one centers around unsuccessful puppeteer ( john cusack ) who figures out how enter into body actor john malkovich 15 minutes time manages turn talent into riches fame but oh my he still isnt happy even tho he gets hang out cameron diaz	-1

***** i liked this film lot . it entertaining , suspenseful , made me think . it staying me i'm continuing think it . " simple plan " asks question , " what if you found $4.4 million gym bag woods ... would you keep it ... what if you thought there reasonably good chance you'd never get caught ... no one would ever know ? " this what happens central characters . dvd cover advertises , " sometimes good people evil things . " once they make their decision , plan their plan , movie illustrates how consequences happen completely unanticipated . bill paxton plays main character wonderful typical " good " middle-class accountant small rural town . bridget fonda excellent job his wife , who very idealistic moralistic until she realizes scenario not hypothetical --- fact , she decide what , she makes decisions different what i would expected . billy bob thornton predictably great , course , playing rural man ( main character brother ) who never chance town he lives just wants truly life , his own way , what right ; he handicapped , however , his intelligence , his eccentricity , his background . i felt lot sympathy his character , since i'm person more like his brother , it fascinating see how he lived thought ... movie progressed , his middle-class brother gained empathy difficult life he led , too . i didn't think any pacing slow , other reviewers said . i thought starkness pacing fit beautifully movie it gave me chance process what going . one moral decision led , each them made me think " would i ? " " could i ? " it made me see how seductive certain crimes certain circumstances any one us . this quality , very suspenseful , provocative film . i think it would equally enjoyable men women but definitely not children all , themes very heavy mature . there no special features or subtitles . i generally like subtitles , but they not necessary this film hearing people , everyone speaks very clearly . i cannot imagine how anyone would dislike this movie . there some violence , but none it gratuitous . i generally really dislike violence movies , but it worth it experience i took away after watching it . *****	1
fantastic film ; memticulous carefully built , loaded highest suspense you may expect . this clever film noir , eastwood outsider . he not detective , but jewel thief who watchs something he never see . this brutal murderer reach highest governement levels which very well planned chase made behind traces eastwood . great script . hackman absolute convincing best role which he represented more than any one else ; immoral , corrupt , decadent perverse villain . intelligent puzzle artistic film prove once more than industry craft may join . one best films his career .	1

this american remake original danish movie , starring stellan skarsgard , which more interesting than this remake . i always wonder why , when hollywood remake , they change things make movie interesting first place . even though i give this remake 4 stars , mainly because al pacino robin williams restrained themselves , hollywood changed ending . check out original . i give danish original 5 stars .	-1

i remember seeing this movie years ago college continued like it ever since . movie starts off 1988 calgary olympics . doug dorsey ( d.b. sweeny ) talented hockey player kate mosley ( moira kelly ) pairs figure skater . both mishaps during their big moments , doug suffering career ending injury kate falling during her performace failing meet her own expectations . movie picks up few years later kate trouble getting new partner doug skids unable fulfill his dream becoming star hockey player . added mix kate russian couch anton pamchenko ( played great roy dotrice ) who decides rick kate new partner they struggle get back 1992 olympics . first glance this sports movie figure skating , but not entirely so . scenes involving leads ice surprisingly abstract neither professional skater . truth this character driven story most action takes place off ice . it absolutely charming watch two lead characters go dislike one , extreme rivalry finally ending up love . thing absolutely makes this happen chemestry leads sweeney kelly . they magic together screen , so much so i am surprised they never paired up again movie . i highly recommend this light hearted romance everyone . side note dvd , only special feature theatrical trailer . there no deleted scenes . this where i question , because version film this dvd i've scene tv recent years not one i remember seeing college . i distinctly remember end scene medal ceremony . i somewhat like version because what doug kate won version so much more . so where version alternative ending ???	-1
i love this film . everyone must see it , least once . just everyone should taste ice cream or smell bouquet fresh lilies-of-the-valley , or fall love ... ya gotta see this . " la strada " part body work , its core , thread autobiographical sentiment so powerful mysterious , scholars still dissecting his films frame frame . although fellini says , criterion collection dvd " extra " " i no message humanity ... i am sorry " , we still believe if we decode images , stories , fantasies dreams fellini experience/imagination , we find profound truths . certainly , experience viewing fellini film proven worthwhile vast audience across geographic , linguistic cultural boundaries , over time . there something this fellini guy stuff ... but what heck it ? i think fellini films distillations beauty , humor , dreams , pathos , nightmares pleasure pain living . when fellini insists he doesn't message , he probably right . he not trying sell ideas . he only trying give form his thoughts dreams nightmares fantasies experiences memories . result something we would call " art " . those us susceptible aesthetic , fellini master . la strada film " neorealist " core . ravaged countryside , long , lonely vistas fields , sea , faces poverty belong large part " neorealist " post-war films look unflinchingly harsh realities war-torn italy . circus , which here forms environment , backdrop individuals who reveal their characters tragic landscape . reading film artist biography " fellini fellini " reveals his attitude toward " auguste " clown " imperious " white clown " , their relationships , power structures , circus metaphor life itself . " 8 1/2 " , film-maker concludes acceptance life circus- parade clowns , lovers , friends associates who enter spotlight give resolution film . who argue ? i think life like circus pretty often . there reality " " circus behind illusions there reality " observor " outside . flip this into any social situation watch it fit . we develop compassion sympathy main characters . giulietta massina luminous female protagonist clown-a kind " auguste " figure ( according fellini own breakdown character types ) . she butt jokes , lost soul , sidekick " white clown " , hapless , confused child . anthony quinn oh-so-dark zampano , strongman ( kind " white clown " authority figure ) who blusters , bosses , bullies frightens . end film , man cries edge sea . he broken , lost , betrayed trust innocent , little reason believe his own soul may saved ... except fact his tears falling . his recognition sanctity life comes late .	1

russians yankees team up save world " meteor " , one last gasps celebrity-disaster movies 1970s ' . ( like " airport " movies - you'd bunch celebs tossed around no other purpose than their headshots printed strip bottom movie poster . ) " meteor " , huge chunk asteroid , blasted out its benign orbit after wayward comet , now heading towards earth . called " orpheus " , chunk 5 miles wide promises kick off nuclear winter arrival . only hope left two space-based missile platforms lofted into orbit nasa soviet union - each pointed targets earth rather than into space . ( i don't remember if platforms , named hercules " peter great " actually violated any treaties , but their owners sure seemed keen keeping them secret . ) americans learn incoming asteroid first , fatally positioned one their spacecraft asteroid belt moment comet collision . they then learn hercules " light " -they'll need extra missiles , since they don't any time put new ones into space ( henry fonda president puts it memorably , they can't just " conjure some out thin air " ) they'll go russians help . waiting orpheus hit , plot boils down scenes scientists realigning their missile platforms away earth , other scenes showing devastation wrought smaller " splinters " . ( interesting move , there aren't any subtitles international targets . ) even if you find special effects lame , score annoying plot thin holed if it too struck meteor , " meteor " surprisingly gets some good mileage its stars . sean connery great post-bond role civilian designer hercules - nasa fixture who resigned when his program taken over military ( " hercules " apparently designed just this eventuality ) . brian keith also great dubov , connery russian counterpart . script most yankees getting russians , so he never foil connery , but he gets some good scenes going genial enraged soviet , improbably speaking all his lines russian . karl malden also rises above what seems like incredibly unnecessary role nasa bureaucrat - he neither scientist , engineer or politician , but he keeps connery maverick line . landau , great actor , plays thankless role cold-war hawk general who fears russians more than shooting stars . fx actually pretty good pre-cgi ( mostly excelling space sequences ) . music seems repetitive , but laurence rosenthal score also evocative russians oncoming asteroid . much movie drags many sequences seem redundant . ( they need all " splinter " scenes ? " avalanche " sequence most ludicrous - world coming end , but there no hint any faces those out skiing alps sequence . ) said , plusses minuses this flick make it memorable , plusses make it worth watching . script places control center hercules underneath old att bulding tribeca , i admit i can't pass place without thinking this movie	-1

i much prefer irony tragedy , after blue i not sure what look forward white . i wound up liking white lot . movies " human condition " , me , almost invariably obvious . while this movie quite bit exploring how man reacts love withdrawing love , impotence power performance , revenge circling back love , i thought it handled such off-hand , dead-pan humor very sweet film . way , it struck me amuse-bouche , one those unexpected treats first-rate chef surprise good customer start meal or sometimes courses . movie quality freshness unexpectedness . zbigniew zamachowski masterful job karol , sad sack if there ever one , who gradually shows determination well obsession . i suppose one must just accept obsession unexplainable plot device movie , but dominique got off very unsympathetic start . she'd wilt most men . karol obsession her seemed bit unreal . i found karol developing into resourceful , intelligent guy whom i began admire . dominique , though , didn't seem change much . after all she put karol through -- unnecessarily cruel most time -- i couldn't empathize much karol , but simply accepted things reason why i enjoying movie . i couldn't help thinking if karol just few viagra handy , none his troubles would begun . but then i thought dominique essential characteristics , i think karol would better off somebody new . i don't see future them . one things i liked lot this movie it kept me guessing . it going romantic comedy , or black comedy or some kind excruciatingly dull exploration sexual inadequacy ? karol really just sad loser when he seemed sort resourceful sad , funny way ? what he trying his property purchase ? where dominque fit or this just cameo delpy ? something sad going happen after i'd figured out it seemed combination black/romantic comedy ? i like movie i can't quite see end . people said this movie equality part trio . i saw this movie clever , bittersweet struggle dominance , not equality , laced little revenge . i thought it sweet , bittersweet , clever movie	-1

many reviewers this site said they would want see film focuses hardships extremes immigrants face when coming united states . this , i respond : we've seen hundreds times films . same goes sports films . we've seen movie glory road other films like coach carter , remember titans , hoosiers . they exactly same movie different team . that not say these films aren't decent sports flicks , but film industry needs take step back when making film potential just like every other film its genre . said , exactly what jim sheridan america . story so original acting makes this film glorious triumph . basic story follows family irish immigrants who come america same notion all immigrants : attain american dream . but , they all sooner or later find out , american dream ideology 99.9% people never attain . they trouble finding place stay , end up apartment top run down building many its residents junkies . father johnny ( paddy considine ) struggling actor , who hasn't able get part since death his son frankie , who fell down stairs . mother sarah ( samantha morton ) takes job ice cream parlor earn rent money . oldest daughter christy ( sarah bolger ) probably one smarter people film , sarah bolger gives flawless performance such young girl . she stereotype oldest child who forced grow up too soon . her younger sister ariel ( played sarah bolger younger sister emma ) typical naive little girl who asks fifty questions everything . there some really touching scenes throughout course film , one especially comes mind , where father almost squanders away all family money trying win e.t. doll youngest daughter . there essentially three miracles film , christy , who also narrator , relates these three events set three wishes her brother frankie told her before he died . other great scenes film involve family their relationship man one floors below . when they first arrive house , christy calls him " man who screams . " this man name mateo ( played brilliantly djimon hounsou ) he brilliant artist quite bit emotional problems . he sort figure " morality " film , often giving out endless amounts advice . mateo some sort disease ( we only expect it probably venerial disease ) he gets sick throughout movie . america features one best ensembles i ever seen . every actor perfect every scene . djimon hounsou paddy considine give best performances entire film , jim sheridan wrote directed every gorgeous shot film . while i agree one other reviewer how christy modern camera story set eighties , stupid facts like these should not detract overall message film . overall message , then , not just how immigrants face hardships when they come america ; we already know previous films and/or experiences . film such deeper message , relating not just immigrants , but every person who watches this film . i really not want give message away , but rather i leave it up you go rent or buy this treasure film . this truly one most unforgettable movies i ever seen	1

this movie incredable . i don't understand how people dislike this film . this movie deep intense story made it great children their parents , feat rarely accomplished . but rather than stay depressing traumatizing , this film goes drama side-splitting humor within 13 seconds . best part this all seemless perfection . music , which key element any disney film , great here . although it doesnt ' distinct broadway feel it , it still very strong . it power brilliance comes something eles entirely , i'm not even sure what.in end though , this one disney greatest efforts . clean , brilliant animation , flawless story , adn increadable music all come together something truely spectacular . only sad thing this became begining end disney animation . so treasure this gem , because here out , it all downhill . :	1

plot synopsis please read amazon review . i wish talk reasons why you love this film . longtime fan both sam raimi ( evil dead series ) bill paxton ( aliens , twister ) , i went see this opening night . not many people claim this i'm sure because it , such small film received next no marketing . shame . this film best tradition modern film noir including blood simple fargo , both made cohen brothers . film buffs able draw connections those films their filmakers , so i won't bother get into . should you seen either these films enjoyed them , i suggest you stop reading immediately rent simple plan . if not , keep reading i try express why this film so remarkably brilliant . why i hope you take look it . simple plan , its core , four people . underneath all plot devices twists , it how they relate one . notice i did't say characters , because this film doesn't actors simply delivering dialogue . it people you get know , understand sympathise they undergo most brutal dilemmas . sure , finding mysterious bag filled money excellent plot device , but heart this film much simpler than . it basic human flaw committing criminal act trying weasel your way out it . forced most unthinkable things process . that what gives this film such depth . you watch these people try figure out how cover every angle so they get away stealing whole lot cash . end it falls apart two reasons : details human factor . they say devil details this never truer than crime . human factor , where greed concerned , people cannot trust one because they fear other person greed while unable satisfy their own . many respects this film almost homage blood simple fargo , but many ways i think it superior . i often draw comparison scene which both simple plan blood simple where body increasingly difficult dispose . even afterwards , after emotional toll taken , once one evil act committed , sure follow . it so painfully facsinating watch person work out their problem camera , frantically going over details their mind , all while their heart beating mile minute . bill paxton this better than anyone . he such likable man ( both film life ) you can't help but feel sorry mess he created . his entire performance balancing act getting away seemingly harmless crime , keeping his partners bay their mouths shut while prodded his conspirator wife . may make them all sound malicious , but really opposite actually true . they're all normal folks , like we've all seen hundred times . end it really gets you because you imagine how you would react same situations they find themselves . after all , you faced choice steal couple million dollars no one would miss , what would you ? but then again , nothing ever simple	1
i found this inspiring , thoughtful , extremely interesting take new paradigm science , quantum mechanics . this movie explains non-technical terms philosophical ramifications theory ( almost universally accepted ) how it relevant our everyday lives -- even non-physicists . it interviews many well credentialed credible physicists , philosophers , theologians , making it engaging even most cynical viewers . interspersed drama showing theories action regular person . me , it helps reconcile spirituality ( christian my case ) scientific theory whereas before i always felt my love science reason constant conflict my spiritual beliefs . no longer ! watch movie , which most part not dogmatic not judgmental but instead eye-opening logically satisfying even " religious . " i love it	1
putting it simply , this film work genius . tom stoppard fanatic , i adored it moment i read play , which even version he considerably unhappy . he significantly more satisfied movie , there very little doubt why . he clearly handle what he doing writing whom he working . any who ever single existentialist thought should see this film -- they may or may not like it , but that not what matters . this film amazing	1

i just read dirk " spolier " ending mothman prophecies say huh ? demonic , fallen angles ? what ? we watch same movie ? if all you go movie , might impression you're left . but if you've ever looked into events happened around point pleasant , or any books subject , you'll see mothman more ufo related than anything . same time mothman sightings point pleasant area wave ufo reports , men-in-black , all sorts goings-on up sky . fact , mothman played only very small part drama , it far predominately ufo related , keel makes clear . unfortunately , producers chose abandon this aspect story entirely , so happenings point pleasant lost their entire frame reference . if you see this movie thinking this way things actually happened , you might come conclusion mothman evil , demonic , fallen angles , whatever you like . but if you research incident all , you'll see you're only getting fraction story movie . if , like dirk , you thereby think you know all what mothman actually based just movie alone , then all your conclusions end up based simply hollywood writer imagination script nothing more . mothman anything demons angels or any religious overtones far truth you could possibly . don't judge movie , read book	-1
hands down one best documentaries ever made . you see variety reactions here , it film engages audience despite its incredibly controversial nature . i'm amazed how split responses regards guilt arnold jessie friedman ( specifically crimes they accused together ) , even more surprised sympathy expressed towards mother , elaine . regardless whether her husband son actually guilty ( record , accusations highly implausible evidence non-existent ) , her behavior selfish atrocious . i'm sure she experiencing her own turmoil thought she doing right thing , but it astounding see woman such poor sense familial commitment claim righteousness over others . especially considering her choices starting this family . fact , it this destruction family dynamic makes piece so compelling . seeing it disolve firsthand , via home videos made friedmans , absolutely fascinating . provided you stomach graphic frank discussion pedophilia , this documentary fantastic	1

this film worth watching over over again , if only see sinatra rendition " lady tramp " , which he sings riveting style musical finesse . based book play john o'hara , it boasts some snappy dialogue fabulous rodgers hart score , songs like " bewitched , bothered bewildered " , " i could write book " , " what i care dame ?

some might suggest there now three things not discuss polite conversation : 1 ) politics 2 ) religion 3 ) viet nam . viet nam , battle would become known hamburger hill resulted over ninety per cent one american platoon dead . yet body count would still necessary see which side suffered greater losses . directing mass charges via waves infantry modern warfare initially chronicled during korean conflict only later officially recognized ' war ' . importantly , hamburger hill also battle before it made into movie also war named but never declared . overview , modern war , film-making or army life , " we soldiers " merits full consideration . mel gibson turns flawless performance walking point this sortie became first major battle viet nam conflict , later unofficially entitled " war .

this one my favourite movies ' 30s . i love everything this film - smart , fashionable sets fashions - sexy , snappy plot - black white photography which just shines ( great watching late night all lights out ) . norma shearer gives terrific performance - surprisingly modern natural , film moves fast pace never dulls . i won't give away plot - which still holds relevance today marraige or partnership ( double standard tackled this film still around ) . ending - its perfect ! you wouldn't want it any other way . previous reviewer stated ending film rather spoiled it her - it contradicted feminism apparent earlier scenes . however , what we here both partners accepting other flaws - if it seems its norma character making all effort that just because she stronger two ( made obvious throughout movie - while her ex husband drinks himself into unemployment her love life career goes strength strength ) . ultimately though , this movie fascinating daring ( its day ) insight into sexual politics ( mgm-style ) among smart set early thirties , viewed such modern viewer . above all else - this movie fun ! if you're fan vintage hollywood then you should love this movie	1

this film motivated me my own research i read much material case i could possibly find -- especially arguments those who maintained three teenagers guilty . honest , i natural skepticism west memphis three claims innocence . coworker mine brutally murdered some years ago two her " friends " who also coworkers arrested murder . i refused believe it first . but it became clear over time evidence overwhelming conclusive . still there those who refused believe facts zealously argued their friends ' innocence . when all said - it come down facts whether or not one chooses face reality believe facts . first , please allow me correct few misconceptions some other reviewers . michael moore mentioned credits refers one little eight-year-old child murder victims , not filmmaker . couple reviewers mentioned necklace worn damien echols which supposedly blood it some victims . actually , nothing more determinable than common blood types found . one almost microscopic spot pendant consistent blood type damien echols ( one accused ) , other micro-spot consistent blood type shared both jason baldwin ( one accused ) steven branch ( one eight-year-old victims ) -- well 11% rest caucasian population united states . all experts agree tiny micro-spots blood transferred number ways -- especially teenage boy wearing necklace against their bare skin . police photos verify jason baldwin also worn damien necklace . police photos taken two days after crime -- show damien without his shirt reveal absolutely no cuts , abrasions or scratches whatsoever . closest thing credible evidence prosecution could manage produce four very tiny fibers found houses damien family jason family which deemed prosecution microscopically similar fibers two victims . but even prosecution expert witness , lisa sakevicius criminologist state crime laboratory acknowledged this inconclusive could just well come mass-produced products obtained off shelves local wal-mart . furthermore , charles linch southwestern institute forensic science dallas refuted claims microscopic similarities his testimony . no fibers whatsoever found home jessie family . during appeal process forensic scientists examining crime scene photos autopsy photos identified human bite marks two victims . this confirmed forensic odontologist . teeth impressions taken three young men prison . none these teeth impressions damien , jason jessie matched these bite marks found victims . highly coerced " confession " jessie misskelly jr. ( 17-year-old borderline retarded boy iq 71 ) so filled obvious errors it obscenity it treated basis making these arrest . i should mention this so-called " confession " came after submitting this boy 12 hour grueling without lawyers , parents or counsel any kind included polygraph test which he passed but told police he failed . judge burnett would not allow jury hear these interrogation techniques . jessie misskelly jr. refused testify court against jason baldwin damien echols stating he simply " not going get up there tell bunch lies " . this spite offer remove his life sentence . read dan stidham ( jessie lawyer ) case synopsis copying pasting web address below : http://www.wm3.org/live/caseintroduction/synopsis_dan.php scenario painted police prosecutors against three teenagers simply scientific impossibility . how earth could there massive blood loss caused ceremonial satanic cult killings three persons middle night without leaving one single micro-speck blood or any other body fluids scene ? they sneak fbi forensic team clean up after them when nobody looking ? luminal testing could reveal blood presence only where police laid or transported bodies . it should also mentioned none scarce shoe prints scene matched jason , jessie or damien either . . scientific view -- see this crime scene analysis profile one america leading forensic scientist which also gives some insight who might actually committed crime . i must warn you - it bit gruesome say least : copy paste this web address : http://www.arwar.org/wm6caseinformation/turveyequivocaldeathanalysisandprofile.htmlso let us briefly summarize . much so-called evidence based notion damien admitted interest wicca religion occult which many local people perceived satanism . this not evidence committing murder . you go any suburban shopping mall bookstore or small town library anywhere middle america find plenty books such subjects . furthermore , neither jason nor jessie ever expressed any particular interest wicca or occult . both damien jason wore mostly black clothes loved heavy metal music . so what ? police actually confiscated 15 black t-shirts jason home evidence prove god knows what . damien undoubtedly troubled teenager troubled family . he bit wise-ass teenager . he wrote some morbid poetry . so what ? couple young girls claimed months after fact they heard damien say he committed murders . any reasonable-objective person listening those testimonies would found them implausible put it politely . young burglar/drug addict who juvenile detention facility claimed shy reserved 16-year-old jason confessed him second time they ever met ghastly stories drinking blood genitals murdered child while worshipping devil . counselor facility warned prosecution this young man not credible gave them detailed reasons . there no evidence jason this young man ever met . even if they -- story ridiculous . still , judge burnett would not allow jury hear counter-testimony or information could challenged credibility this witness . so-called " confession " jessie scenario put forward police prosecution would involved massive amounts blood left scene . there not even one tiny micro-spec . physical impossibility . simple fact all forensics either exonerating or completely inconclusive . " there lack physical evidence tie anyone or anything crime scene .

one major problems i encounter people who viewed this cinematic masterpiece kurosawa film pretentious boring . more importantly , truth readily available viewer if he or she just watches film . however , point film . what truth ! we viewer foreknowledge crime criminal charged . " rashomon " always one my favorite films akira kurosawa , although i not place it top five his greatest . but kurosawa fascinating insight into truth dares us look what we hold " truth . " there any absolute truths ? if so , whose ? this film attempts let viewer decide who telling truth . relativism , [ corollary skepticism ] truth or belief truth relative position person who making statement . which turn directly questions ideal objectivity : since this undermines belief people get outside themselves order get truth . therefore , if truth depends observer viewpoint , how there universal truth -- or even absolute truth ? i believe kurosawa attempting show audience although truth may not absolute , there still truths . therefore , even though each characters kurosawa thrown into this film give us different viewpoint truth they witnessed it , individual themselves give enough their perception [ through their own objectivity ] , which truth still found . kurosawa so wonderful way giving four different versions murder rape : one witness , three versions people involved crime . me , film telling many ways , some which i am sure i am wrong , however , film fascinating way kurosawa uses non-verbal area film : visuals themselves . many kurosawa films , cinematography all talking . much gathered this film just looking scenery , trying not focus too much dialogue ; visuals themselves much , if not more , story . who telling truth ? why there different versions ? this i leave others decide themselves . film , attempt get truth really fascinating . telling sign kurosawa knew what he doing especially evident when looking reviewers amazon disagreeing each other . kurosawa what he set out : what truth ? toshiro mifune bandit who charged crime , he terrific acting job . movie also stars great takashi shimura woodsman who discovers scene crime . this classic highly recommended . however , it may not appeal all viewers . rent it first . [ i own it ] but since this film foreign , ambiguous many areas , some viewers may problems it . [ stars : 4.5	1

this film long one my top ten favorites quality acting screenplay , importance theme : secret network could operate within intelligence community beneath radar legitimate agency oversight . film seems especially prescient now , given fictional network goal planning u.s. invasion mideast . voila , 30 years later , u.s. invaded mideast . when redford character finally confronts rogue c.i.a. leader plan , he connects dots says , " this whole damn thing oil , isn't it ? " exactly . let clear why u.s. armed forces iraq , rather than , say , ecuador or nepal : it strategic importance region oil . yes , plan transform iraq into democratic nation , which lead entire region direction . but u.s. isn't committing its treasure citizenry all troubled regions globe equally ; we iraq because it strategic linchpin region . without access mideast oil reserves , world economy would shaken its foundations . there many troubled , undemocratic regions world -- example , much africa ; yet we fight now establish democracy only one troubled region , mideast . coincidence ? no . simple self-interest . cliff robertson character says film conclusion : " when people cold their engines stop running , they're not going ask us why ; they'll just want us go get it . " realizing he embarrassment c.i.a. ( inevitable role any whistleblower , even reluctant one ) , film end redford gives entire story new york times . robertson character , c.i.a. station chief who caught off-guard hidden conspiracy , says , " but they print it ? " redford taken aback implication -- government could pressure media suppress story -- then he avers , less confidently , " they'll print it . " this core democracy : free press keeps government answerable its people . without free skeptical press , all elections world mean nothing .	1

station agent touching , yet off beaten path kind flick i found simply endearing watch . fin ( peter dinklage ) just inherited train depot somewhere out new jersey . passion trains , he embraces this his home . however , he only wishes left alone finds that not easy he would thought . first , he discovers joe ( bobby cannavale ) who set up food truck outside his home . joe conversationalist , desperate talk anyone everyone . next fin meets olivia ( patricia clarkson ) , who almost runs him off road , twice . these three appear nothing common , despite all odds , they form friendship heartwarming see . all three actors gave amazing performances . dinklage , always , commands every scene he . i've missed seeing him since bastards cbs quashed threshold , so it nice see something him it again . cannavale amused me his character , joe , who really needed " get life . " idea quite time not something he easily grasp say least . clarkson radiated olivia , character trying put her life back together again after lost her son her husband leave her . what i liked most this flick honest portrayal it gave us life through fin eyes . there chronic stares he got just smaller than average . plus , there scene grocery store where cashier didn't even see he standing there , so she didn't ring him up until he could get her attention . it just made me think what it must really like not fit standard mold physically . all all , excellent film	-1
i'm starting appreciate john lecarre novels more than i when he all over bestseller list . this film version one acted well , but 30 minutes there just wasn't anything engage my interest . not its characters not its plot . good cause worth building story around , but not this story . i quit watching , so i guess i could wrong , but i doubt it .	-1
big fan anime comedy ( intelligent , yet lame humor ) i eager see el hazard " magnificent world " . because high price set , i some hesitation ( because some poor reviews amazon ) . well , i say bad reviews wrong . this dvd series totally awesome ( although i admit it started bit slow ) . i promise more you keep watching , better it gets . plot highly intelligent ( involving dimensional time travel ) characters very interesting ( distinctive special powers ) . some say humor el hazard juvenile ( but i would argue no more juvenile then southpark ) , seriously what good comedy isn't juvenile ? some also say story sometimes too redundant ( because many episodes involve doomsday device ) , which i respond " we call original starwars trilogy redundant because they involve death star " ? no , ofcourse not . yes this dvd set lacks some extras , but i think pioneer great job . dvd menu presentation beautiful , box very elegant too . hopefully you get this set around 40 dollars ebay ( beware bootlegs ) . it very hard find good authentic set . sequel " alternative world " which i just ordered , individually should cost around 30 dollars if you shop smart . my fellow anime comedy fans , i also reccomend " niea under 7 " " his her circumstances " . animation = 5plot = 4music = 4characters = 5comedy = 4total = 4.4 star	1
opening strip scene reminiscent barbarella - too bad those aren't basinger legs though . nerdy scientist falls galactic beauty presented kim basinger . i never understood ackroyd characters . keeping form , he once again unfunny mud . basinger tries so hard - too hard - rescue this film , but that no small task considering ineptness this way silly film . ok so she munches batteries , thinks she cook everything kitchen mealtime . she seems genuine betty crocker given her favorite foods nuts bolts . jon lovitch also tries prop up ackroyd this weak script . however , his contribution seems way overstated me . he doesn't much . funny scenes inwhere teenage girl eventually decides her step-mother not like other people . basinger character magic purse annoying creepy critter it who tells her what . think , jar-jar blinks . i suppose it ok backdrop housecleaning . but that it . flat mechanical	-1

film begins gripping scenes haunting music ... fighter jets landing , powerful spiritual music sad almost like funeral - setting tone what come . ben affleck plays cia agent jack ryan perfection . there great casting all major roles key characters book . although book , city denver location used terrorists attack , choice baltimore , maryland makes sense , since there port which clearly point entry contraband . fact film remains true intentions spirit tom clancy book . there political maneuvering , espionage , edge-of-your seat gripping moments after attack very well executed plot . suspense builds story unfolds ... topic fascinating timely . it almost like " 007 " films old ... you more or less know what expect , but ride so engaging , you caught up drama events . nuclear bomb discovered desert bedouin , left buried downed airplane during ' 73 israeli war . he suspects it some value make money selling it . agent purchases it mere pittance , vastly less than its true worth ... so realistic . after unexpected death russian president , his replacement investigated cia . us president , his advisors cia busy extracting information this relative " dark horse " discover his stand major issues . past , jack ryan written paper him , extrapolating his views world events ... he accompanies delegation us visit russia ensure nuclear disarmament going according plans . each side assesses opposition wary reminders past ever forefront their minds ... how difficult it learn soviet arms during cold war , us agents died trying access . information ... now delegation freely shown labs , nuclear reactor storage facilties . times indeed changed ... us president attends filled capacity football stadium baltimore , md when suddenly , unexpectedly rapidly secret agents usher him out ... huge explosion occurs , mushroom cloud indicating nuclear bomb went off . during disaster , jack ryan seeks his superior , only find him taking his last breath . he pays his last respects uses his cell phone id bage enter white house . jack discovered irrefutable evidence proves it * not * russian attack . nuclear substance originated united states . fingerprints explosion subsequent fall out positive proof . however , suspense builds us president russian president stand-by preparing war ... trying read each others motives action . unraveling peace accords takes minutes although it took years years create peace disarmament . difficult decisions faced us president depicted superbly ... raw emotions arising during such national disaster naturally conveyed . only failure film choice selecting disgruntled fascist group culprits attack . keeping it closer story line book would paid off huge dividends short long run . years following 2001 sept . 11th attack , using ancient history such nazi-like fascists enemy just not play well audience . it leaves huge credibility gap ... this why it reminds me " 007 " films . despite this one major flaw , which i deducted one star , film hit this viewer . i highly recommend it . erika borsos [ pepper flower	-1
i absolutely loved this movie . it fast paced , funny , exciting , really revived my interest history . parents should definitely watch this their kids move forward any interest history their children show afterwards . they should come up something like this math science well .	1
yeah , that how i felt when i noticed lack gore lack development characters . even zombies same thoughout picture . how zombie go one part town next what would take serious muscle car least hour ? regardless , it worth owning scene where they rise out cemetery . kid downright annoying but , when i kid i liked him ! suppose it not time kids yet , aye ? regardless it could better . flawed but , if you viewed this before first one ... don't let it stop you getting first ! first one rocked . i thought 3rd one produced much better than this well ... but they just keep killing this series part 4 5 i once again heard terrible	-1

there very few films literally brought tears my eyes . they must films uncompromising emotional power . films like magnolia , passion christ , now johnny belinda . it story deaf dumb young woman named belinda . treated unintelligent workhorse all her years , belinda life changes forever when lonely new doctor moves into her small coastal nova scotian port town . he takes immediate liking her , proving her family she not " dummy " they think , he teaches her read lips . but after drunken sexual assault leaves her pregnant , rumors begin fly throughout small town , both belinda her loved ones must fight what righ t.t he performances wonderful . course , jane wyman simply steals show her oscar-winning performance . she brings incredible heart , warmth , emotional resonance character belinda , she it without ever saying word . rest cast marvelous well , especially charles bickford , who lovingly portrays belinda father , stephen mcnally , who turns belinda attacker into one most easy loathe characters ever put celluloid - yet film still brilliantly keeps him level realistic personality - no one caricature . director jean negulesco brings understated visual beauty film reminiscent silent ages , when one use aesthetics make up lack aural stimulus . every shot perfectly composed work art , turning every moment belinda into masterwork lighting raw , majestic nature . seaside settings utilized so well they put johnny belinda league such legendary jaw-droppers l'avventura black narcissus . but this film much more than just visual appeal . it both heartwarming heartbreaking , often simultaneously . there so many thought-provoking themes gnaw johnny belinda - way people view handicapped , bonds parenthood , power rumors , justification violence self-defense , overall morality humanity . even film setting could considered allegory belinda - brutal waves ocean constantly pounding against serene shores . film also , i mentioned before , emotionally overwhelming . while it certainly focused narrative , belinda foremost progression feelings , they so well conveyed i simply overcome joy , pain , heartbreak , hope . while film often described melodrama , it far soap opera . there no miraculous moments sudden verbal triumph belinda , no ridiculously overacted moments teary-eyed abandon - johnny belinda terribly real experience . there aspects story remain unresolved - not loose ends , but difficult problems would most likely also remain unresolved reality . however , i don't want give impression johnny belinda depressing . i felt uplifted rapturous just often i felt overcome grief fear . i felt so much these characters i wanted so sorely things turn out certain way - but i won't reveal whether they or not . i say film ends note nearly unbearable poignancy , this moment massaged my tear ducts . my only complaint concerning film max steiner score . he perfectly suited epic films like king kong gone wind , but here it feels somewhat overdramatic occasionally awkward . he tends play up melodramatic angle spot score ubiquitous manner , which simply doesn't fit film like johnny belinda . still , it tends work more often than not , it not major enough problem work seriously film detrimen t.t his picture true gem . it unavailable years , but thanks warner brothers , it finally dvd release , restoration simply glorious - it more than justice this cinematic treasure . yourself favor see johnny belinda	1

i enjoy this movie very much . amazon.com great deal wit	1
this movie might save few kids if their parents get it . real evil fact many large corporations target kids time they diapers . commercials aimed directly little kids get them eat foods harmful your health . fast food only one many fall into this category . adults realize poor diet harmful your health but kids lured these " pushers " garbage contrary everything we want kids eat . once they hooked they nag you until you get them next fix french fries . think it clown , play areas , free toys , yummy food , what kid would not love it . least movie makes it clear eating this stuff cause your organs shut down shorten your life span . sure adults just say no , but kids trust enough actually believe no one would harm them just make buck . parents must stop this schools need keep this food out ofthe cafeteria . i just want also touch industry aspect exploits work force uses lobbyist maintaintheir cheap disposable work force . sure corporations enjoy big profits when you hire people , pay them almost nothing , provide no insurance , fire them without union mediate , put them harms way no regard their safety but this how we all lose . we all pay taxes cover housing , medical , law enforcement , education , etc while corporations enjoy increased profits . they stay business because government looks other way happily taking money so they blast us commercials election time vote them . we all pay price high our integrity what stake right our way life	-1
katie holmes stars " pieces april " , interesting film thanksgiving family . katie holmes plays april . she bit black sheep her family something rebel . she moved new york went out drug dealer , but now she trying put her life back track . she got caring new boyfriend ( derek luke ) , who she lives their modest , kind run down apartment . april family visit them thanksgiving this year , she really wants get things right , especially since it might her mother last thanksgiving dinner , her mother cancer . everything should fine , april thinks , she got all cooking figured out her head , she just it . doing cooking , however , becomes little more difficult when april oven breaks down . left no other choice , april goes door door her building , looking place cook her turkey , even if it only couple hours . april manage piece together perfect meal ? resonable meal ? she manage make meal all ? this film digital video , which i think its advantages disadvantages . digital , image fairly crisp , which means all cooking scenes really clear . you see she not working cleanest kitchen , or most delicious turkey , or using best ingredients . video , it looks little lower budget than your average film , which kind emphasizes smallness delapidation apartment . i could lived without all shaky camerawork though . i found this comedy section my dvd store , but it more like drama , i think . there funny moments , but they kind rise out situation , rather than played laughs . there sad moments , moments tension , whole range emotions . gets bit grim , little depressing times , but then again , it could lot worse . most characters likeable , when they're not , you understand where they're coming . i quite liked soundtrack , which seemed feature quite lot songs magnetic fields band ( according subtitles ) called " 6ths " . magnetic fields list bands i've meaning check out , so it nice hear some music them . special features include 15 minute behind scenes piece called " all pieces fit together " , which contains rehearsal footage interviews cast . there also audio commentary director original theatrical trailer . not what i expected , but interesting enough . worth look	-1

don't waste your time this , folks . this movie bad bad bad ! horrible acting , stupid story ( prince directed it himself , hey , he can't good everything ) outrageously ridiculous dialogue . but few songs aren't bad ( mountains , girls boys , sometimes it snows april ) that why i'm even giving it one star . this really dumb tale prince morris day valet jerome benton going france where former gigolo who falls love . one thing good i say this slop hogs it better than laxative-on-film " graffiti bridge .

" greetings " offbeat satire very young brian de palma starring equally young robert de niro . vignettes focus three friends . first there jon rubin ( de niro ) , aspiring filmmaker who idea creating " peep art . " this would consist filming " private moments , " then letting people view them through tiny windows , thereby re-creating peeping tom experience ( more this de palma much better 1970 film , " hi , mom ! " ) . however , if you expecting see amazing performance one great actors his generation early film , you going disappointed . de niro comes off overly mannered bit forced his performance , especially comparison his two co-stars . his best moment off-screen he talks woman through going bed his peep art ( she repeatedly forgets not talk ) . but he lot better two years later decent career , least until he started making credit card commercials . first there lloyd clay ( gerrit graham ) , conspiracy nut so obsessed jfk assassination half-naked woman sleeping his bed just opportunity show paths indicated bullet holes not match up ( unless jfk shot while standing his head ) . lloyd shares his deep , dark thoughts directly viewing audience he argues vigorously convince us he right . but sometimes he finds people real world assault his blow-ups zapruder film reduce assassination rorschach test . finally , we paul gerald shaw ( jonathan warden ) , who would like find right girl . his problem he his induction physical going vietnam really hurt his love life . fortunately , lloyd jon fully ideas how paul get army reject him , everything pretending gay coming sergeant ( lloyd idea ) volunteering shoot not only vietcong but also any american troops color ( jon brainstorm ) . there no real narrative thread here , which hardly criticism because " greetings " more ancestor " groove tube , " " saturday night live , " " second city tv " history contemporary sketch comedy heavy satirical bent . difference what de palma his friends come up " greetings " more experimental guerilla theater than really polished sketch comedy . but there something compelling its enthusiasm , which makes us forgive filmmaker his actors when things go bit too long . de palma admitted influenced godard french " nouvelle vague " cinema , which inspired going out street trying improvise scenes ( only they not enough film improvise , so they ended up rehearsing most film save money ) . but even this early work , de palma clearly into doing everything you movie camera ( inter-titles , split-screen , slow-motion , fast-motion , etc . ) . " greetings " historical footnote cinematic history inasmuch it first film u.s. given " " rating ( later changed " , " which what it would qualify today because some shots nude women ) . terms social history " greetings " represents some counter-culture politics late 1960s . it almost thirty years since i first saw " greetings " " hi , mom !

film wonderful snapshot decline fall american town . scenes parties flint rich folks gm executives , interspersed poor workers evicted their homes , great . i also loved seeing reagan hearing flint citizens talk how he going bring jobs back . this president who put our country road bankruptcy . moore wants save his home town help people poverty . he sincere guy . i'm less convinced proposals he mind would accomplish anything . i see it , problem flint not gm bad corporate citizen , or government isn't doing enough help poor . real difficulty flint prosperity 50s 60s illusion begin . after second world war america chose base its transportation system automobile . this seemed work ok while , because gasoline seemed plentiful cheap . unfortunately , this approach transportation some nasty side effects . it made our towns ugly our people fat , not mention changing climate . today we're coming end era cheap oil passing hubbert peak . oil comes millions years ' worth stored sunlight , when it gone , it gone . next few decades getting around all going become increasingly difficult . we'll wishing we invested streetcar lines walkable cities instead all those freeways . automobile still subsidized tune billions dollars america today . that just money down rat hole . more perspective dominance automobile american life , i would suggest kunstler books " geography nowhere " " long emergency .

i'm not very familiar books daniel handler ( lemony snicket ) but , even judging this film alone , i'm going say his work appeals me lot more than harry potter . kids enjoyed it lot after watching it they wanted second round . story centers three adorable gifted children who're abruptly orphaned when their parents die mysterious fire . their search new home well-meaning new guardians constantly interfered malicious count orlaf ( jim carrey ) who hunts after bauedelaires ' family fortune . main reason why this film so genuinely unsettling because story relentlessly uncovers deepest fear every child , namely death parents large risk ending up ill-natured new guardians . most fairy-tale don't even dare bring up this nightmarish idea , but " lemony snicket ... " entirely revolves around it . equally effective , course , ghoulish landscapes , dark scenery amazingly eccentric characters . most time , it feels like you're watching typical tim burton film that giant compliment , since his style practically unique ( sinister , witty heart-warming all once ! ) . there lot cgi here but not point annoy you , since all these exaggeratedly fake special effects ( leeches , aunt josephine seaside-house ) contribute morbid atmosphere . cast terrific well , jim carrey count orlaf one most memorable performance date . i admit i initially feared carrey performance would far over-the-top , but he surprisingly mature convincing . bauedelaire-children very well cast well so billy connolly meryl streep most important supportive roles . great cast completed respectable names ( luiz guzm�n , catherine o'hara , jennifer coolidge , cedric entertainer ... ) small roles . sublime film . it funny , it interesting , it creative ! i recommend taking chance this one- if you like art , if you like jim carrey , if you like unique plots , highly recommended all type audiences !	-1

" all family " certainly ground-breaking tv show , episodes selected this vhs video give you pretty good idea why true . archie bunker , all his bigoted splendor , comes life right away premiere episode series , entitled " meet bunkers " ( first aired january 1971 ) . addition first episode , this tape also gives us season-one program ( episode # 8 ) , " lionel moves into neighborhood " , show season two , " flashback : mike meets archie " ( which 18th episode series ) . this 1998-produced color video columbia tri-star home video presented ( some odd reason i've yet fathom ) " ep " ( extended play ) mode . ( well , least copy i received ep mode ; perhaps some other copies * * recorded sp ; i cannot sure this . ) but this ep recording makes no sense me all , since all 70 minutes could easily fit tape spool " sp " ( standard ) playback mode , give better quality boot . it also seems strange columbia produced some tapes this series 10 " all family " videos sp mode , while others ( like this one ) recorded inferior ep speed . most curious indeed . but , even so , video audio look sound pretty good here , considering limitations vhs format . fact , hi-fi mono sound this tape actually sounds * better * than audio any multiple aitf boxed sets dvd . dvd audio tracks seem tad " weak " me . completists beware ! --- these columbia/tri-star videos " aitf " not showing complete , uncut episodes . some large chunks programming edited out this video , others this series too . which , again , seems strange , because there no commercial interruptions here , obviously no need trim anything time reasons . but , obviously , columbia used truncated , syndicated prints these " all family " videos . example missing scenes --- first episode this tape , final 2 3 minutes epilog scene missing ( when archie mike/meathead talking greeting card edith received earlier episode ) . it * * , indeed , all just " filler " , without much substance , but it would still nice see shows uncut . if you desire see complete , unedited shows , you'll purchase seasonal boxed sets " all family " dvd . dvds present shows uncut form , which great see , because there some often-excised scenes shown dvds you've probably never seen before , due chopped-up prints shown commercial tv . smile-inducing dialogue courtesy mr. archie bunker " meet bunkers " .................. archie ( talking daughter gloria ): " pull skirt down ! ...... every time you sit down one them things , mystery over !

when i first saw this film , some five years ago , it truly knocked breath out me . first time , director allison anders gives us glimpse into mexican-american gang life east la echo park , female perspective , this time . past , we seen our share male experiences ( example zoot suit , written playwright luis valdez ) . once , we see gritty side gang life , young mexicanas ( or chicanas , depending who you ask ) struggle stay alive , amidst rampant drug dealing , violence gang initiation their relationships men who less than honorable them . mi vida loca actually trilogy stories . ( mousie sad girl , lowrider la blue eyes ) first story life long friendship fellow gang members , mousie ( seidy lopez ) sad girl ( angel aviles ) . these young women best friends , until day sad girl sleeps mousie boyfriend , ernesto ( jacob vargas ) , becomes pregnant his child . world they knew before ruptured , their lifelong connection friends . second story takes glimpse lowrider culture . this culture perpetuated , predominantly , young chicanos who build their lives around re-finishing airbrushing " low rider " cars ( many , old school chevies ) , complete flashy airbrush images ( example voluptuous women gang affiliations ) , trick tires rims . this story actually wonderful example modern magical realism , when car takes life its own . third story centered around la blue eyes , beautiful brown-eyed woman who writing convict , she falls love through exchange letters . question , when they finally meet , sum those letters even measure up their encounter , or young woman ultimately deceived , whole time ? i reccomend this film , if not fact it compelling , but this important culture society we should all learn something more . very important study gang life , how it evolves neighborhood many only hear evening news , but never get know	-1

i heard this film director ken loach few years before getting see it , i can't emphasize how impressive film - it not only realistic war drama , but examines expresses complexities one greatest problems 20th century - struggle working class people some kind system other than capitalism not tainted authoritarianism anti-humanism lenin , trotsky stalin ussr or mao mainland china . regardless downplaying right-wing " business usual " extremists like angel garralda ortega ( who wrote review attacked this movie below ) , there really ( still ) libertarian communist movement - made up anarchists - based idea worker shrugging bosses landlords off their back - not forcibly banning exploitation use state it laws , but rather libertarian idea not letting oneself exploited , not exploiting others - abandoning essence capitalism anti-authoritarian manner . also , mr. ortega it wrong - sporadic killings republican side opening spanish civil war only amounted some 3 or 4 thousand deaths fascist supporting landlords spanish catholic church officials who orders kill libertarians republicans sight . anarchist cnt organization opposed such vigilantism punished those individuals it . contrast this hundreds thousands millions tortured executed republicans , libertarians , liberals , workers , small businessmen , progressive catholics , protestants , so who opposed franco after civil war end 1939 . also , poum not trotskyist . it independent socialist organization broken trotsky , it leading figure , andrs nin , executed stalinists - like so many militia fighters such anarchist camillo berneri . amazon review , jonas liljestrm gothenburg , sweden explained basic point i am making better than i could : " historians who attempt rehabilitate franco reputation often tend overlook fact whereas republicans generally tried avoid unnecessary acts brutality during war , nationalists exactly opposite . mass killings , rapes , looting wanton destruction commonplace they terrorised civilians newly conquered areas , trying discourage them putting up resistance . repression political opponents continued virtually throughout duration franco regime . fact franco fought communism no reason glorify him . after all , hitler same , but homicidal aspects his politics so blatantly obvious it would quite impossible depict him anything resembling heroic figure . my opinion , defending franco outrageous ethical point view it would defend hitler , mussolini or stalin . " but i digress ... this film accurately shows how there popular libertarian socialist revolution madrid barcelona spain 1936 crushed stalinists year later , leading inevitable disheartenment loss civil war those who wanted preserve liberty democracy . actors this film likely unfamiliar us viewers , but i know lead , ian hart , later first harry potter film . sure also see magnificent spanish civil war film " libertarias " directed vicente aranda . it focus more squarely anarchist cnt , instead independent marxist poum . artificial eye releasing region 2 dvd this film , available uk version amazon . i very strongly recommend this excellent drama one best ways learn spanish civil war	1

released 1949-this movie stars toshiro mifune one his earliest roles tokyo cop murakami , who gun stolen which leads his relentless drive recover weapon-which used crime spree . we actually see very little yusa-the man who winds up gun -- i'm not totally convinced use name not coincidental considering japan occupied yu-s-a time . perhaps mifunes attempt retrieve missing gun restore his honor symbolic japans attempt restore it honor after war . then again-i may reading into this it may not any such thing -- however kurosawa himself-in regard problems american spca this movie stated " i never any other moment experienced stronger sense regret over japan losing war " regerdless , other films such " madadayo " " rhapsody august " -kurosawa touched conflict atomic bomb-and not implying he anti-american -- i thnk it possibility yusa could symbolic meaning . theory aside , this excellent movie-which preserved quite well considering it age conditions when it filmed -- when neither mifune or kurosawa major stars japan still recovering war . while mifune my favorite actor--i'm so used him playing samurai -- this role took little getting used -- but his performance quite good-as one would expect ! basically , this story revolves around murakami ( mifune ) who mentored sato ( takashi shimura ) their pursuit missing gun yusa ( isao kimura ) . if nothing else-this film fascinating it historical presentation post war japanany mifune/kurosawa fans should enjoy this movie ! while quite different-a more recent movie same basic premise which very good " missing gun	1

just name alone -- " darkman " -- you know you expect something spectacularly refreshing superhero genre . indeed this . sam raimi taking directing , liam neeson playing lead role , danny elfman scoring music , how could anything go wrong ? well , although it not timeless masterpiece enjoyable eveyone , it one those films well worth cult status it recieved . darkman , we given story love , madness , revenge . scientist peyton westlake devolping breakthrough product : synthetic skin . unfortunately , his lawyer girlfriend -- julie -- exposed some city organized crime , criminals decide bust up westlake some payback . although not quite brutal murphy near-death scene robocop , this one vicious nonetheless . finish job off , they set explosives westlake laboratory where he lies helpless blood-spattered floor . bomb destroys lab alright , but it so powerful westlake body flung building into nearby harbor . he alive , but horrible condition . nearby hospital where his identity unknown , he subjected strange tests . before long , he awakes his bandages . he now terrible flashbacks tortured his hightened emotions , yet barely feels any physical pain . he finds while his body mind complete mess , he quite strong . he escapes hospital sets up murky new lab abandoned building . now story truly begins . using his synthetic skin technology , he able disguise himself virtually anyone ( after all , his severely disfigured facial features might raise few questions folks crossing street ) . but all great things come cost . skin terminates after set amount time , so he only stay public so long . he uses different disguises get his enemies -- well his girlfriend who believes man she loves dead . mental torment julie slipping away him , animalistic anger he must unleash those who've harmed him , he becomes more driven than ever . he tracks down bad guys , giving them dose their own medicine side sweet vengeance . westlake seemingly dead , new breed justice born . before long , this anti-hero realizes his calling , becoming only thing he now destined : darkman . visual style certainly one more interesting aspects darkman . character peyton -- when not disguise -- wears torn bandages over his face , shadowed grim hat . his trench coat mysterious haunting batman cape it flaps breeze . not surprisingly , he also takes some nice one-liners witty tricks . it just me , or this sound like great candidate representative dark superheros ? accompanied finely woven storyline , intense characters , stylish to-the-bone action , sense new form heroism risen which we all relate , this just seems too good pass up ! conclusion , darkman must-rent if not must-own . there seems lack truely stylish original concepts modern cinema . but this succeeds giving us something out ordinary , well worth second look . so see what all whispering witness new face crime-fighting all it terror fun darkman dvd ! because somewhere lost crowd , lurks legend ...	-1

i just received my 2nd copy this video , my vcr ate first one . it great video , parts it little cheesy but it well worth money . there 3 sets 12 reps per exercise , you work shoulders first , starting muscle building exercise , overhead press , then you go front raises , rear delt raises , lateral raises which cory calls toning shaping exercises . she repeats this pattern all muscle groups . then it biceps , first 3 sets normal bicep curls palms out , then 1 arm concentration curls , then hammer curls . you repeat concentration curls 2 more times , but last exercise " tri-set " instead hammer curls , you normal bicep curls bicep curls where you turn you arm top . after biceps she work forearms , forearm curls , wrist curls , reverse wrist curls . i usually skip these insert few chest back exercises which not included this workout . lastly , it triceps , you lying tricep extensions first , then french press , kickbacks last exercise lying close grip bench press which really works your triceps . there also brief warmup cooldown . this workout half hour very thorough muscle groups represented . it move fast pace , reps little fast , which i end up pausing tape often rest or finish set . but really only negative this video . i think cory pleasant instructor , she encouraging , motivating inspiring . i plan using this video twice week addition my other workouts , i am anxious see results . this tape i am sure i get them	-1

remember movies we used see where you went away feeling good what you saw ? this one rare ones they made recently where good guys ( not necessarily wearing white hats ) obvious bad guys ( not necessarily wearing black hats ) always their good guy heels . i left feeling like i could watch one again again while learning little bit american history	1

book better than movie but i like this genre so i gave it try . glad i	-1
not long time i such dislike movie i freeway . i am fan dark comedies so i thought i might check this movie out , it reese witherspoon after all , how bad could it ? well , really bad . first all good note , reese witherspoon good enough movie , although her character isn't all likeable nor you empathize her all much . but reese good job what shes given . my main beef movie i would not call it dark comedy . it more like comedy also wants dark , graphic serious , or dark graphic serious movie wants funny . result it movie doesnt know what it or what it trying . both funny parts serious parts horribly mixed together way it feels like two different movies fighting screen . but hey , if you find shot neck , or stiff lifeless grandmas their throats slit horrified expression their face funny , you just might like this movie	-1

it no accident 100 people took time review this film they took time because it remarkable film . i read quite few reviews here many reviewers touched cancer their personal lives this real gentle story obviously hit home . i always enjoyed emma thompson , loved her remains day but thought she sort measured . she measured this performance well because character but she so real her porformance seemed act courage .... love . i think supporting cast equally strong . it also if they knew what this woman up against , but exception nurse , they not want acknowledge it . i believe this strongest acting performance i ever seen , either stage or film it would ironclad oscar emma thompson medium big screen . finally ms thompson thank you .... some they only manage whisper telling story cancer journey ... it lonely one so aptly captured here	1
my watching this film resulted conversation friend beginning politics spiraling down future our world . premise film disturbing say least . i never true fan charleton heston who my opinion always overacted . however , edward . robinson seemed comfortable playing this character he many different roles he played . his performance truly heartfelt , bringing mind current debate " ending one own life dignity " . i shutter think this life it should though . but robinson character acted decision counterfeit courage ultimate hopelessness accompanied it such way you could very well empathize him . i found other actors somewhat bland . perhaps this acting point time , but some actors make most roles others cannot . story line unique , but script lacking . re-make today steven spielberg might worthwhile seeing . perhaps most striking element i took this film unshakeable chilling unsettling feeling this could very well our world if we not wake up	-1

many reviewers this site said they would want see film focuses hardships extremes immigrants face when coming united states . this , i respond : we've seen hundreds times films . same goes sports films . we've seen movie glory road other films like coach carter , remember titans , hoosiers . they exactly same movie different team . that not say these films aren't decent sports flicks , but film industry needs take step back when making film potential just like every other film its genre . said , exactly what jim sheridan america . story so original acting makes this film glorious triumph . basic story follows family irish immigrants who come america same notion all immigrants : attain american dream . but , they all sooner or later find out , american dream ideology 99.9% people never attain . they trouble finding place stay , end up apartment top run down building many its residents junkies . father johnny ( paddy considine ) struggling actor , who hasn't able get part since death his son frankie , who fell down stairs . mother sarah ( samantha morton ) takes job ice cream parlor earn rent money . oldest daughter christy ( sarah bolger ) probably one smarter people film , sarah bolger gives flawless performance such young girl . she stereotype oldest child who forced grow up too soon . her younger sister ariel ( played sarah bolger younger sister emma ) typical naive little girl who asks fifty questions everything . there some really touching scenes throughout course film , one especially comes mind , where father almost squanders away all family money trying win e.t. doll youngest daughter . there essentially three miracles film , christy , who also narrator , relates these three events set three wishes her brother frankie told her before he died . other great scenes film involve family their relationship man one floors below . when they first arrive house , christy calls him " man who screams . " this man name mateo ( played brilliantly djimon hounsou ) he brilliant artist quite bit emotional problems . he sort figure " morality " film , often giving out endless amounts advice . mateo some sort disease ( we only expect it probably venerial disease ) he gets sick throughout movie . america features one best ensembles i ever seen . every actor perfect every scene . djimon hounsou paddy considine give best performances entire film , jim sheridan wrote directed every gorgeous shot film . while i agree one other reviewer how christy modern camera story set eighties , stupid facts like these should not detract overall message film . overall message , then , not just how immigrants face hardships when they come america ; we already know previous films and/or experiences . film such deeper message , relating not just immigrants , but every person who watches this film . i really not want give message away , but rather i leave it up you go rent or buy this treasure film . this truly one most unforgettable movies i ever seen	1

this what happens when musicians ( least most them ) foray into fields which they should not trod . i great fortune seeing neil diamond " live " shortly after release this movie , like always , he brought down house . he just may one greatest entertainers who ever graced concert stage . singer-songwriter , they don't make ' em better ( remember he honed his craft during golden age late 60 famous brill building new york city where artists such carole king gerry goffin , howard greenfield neil sedaka phil spector ( name just few ) also honing their crafts ) . point mr. diamond second none field rock/pop music day he stops recording entertaining music industry huge loss . this movie - let me just say this : if you take away music sequences , what you left some most horrible stuff ever seen film . this movie so inept even legend like lawrence olivier ( who plays cantor rabinovich , mr. diamond jewish father)stinks . his acting so ' hammy ' it embarrasing . i mean , when he blurts out " i hef no son ! " after realizing his son ( mr. diamond ) sleeping ms. arnaz , i lost it ! lucie arnaz ? oh my !! how " i don't love lucy " ? her acting so amateurish it hard not giggle . this 25th anniversary edition dvd not impressive , either . picture quality poor ( very grainy ) . sound quality very good , though , but dts not appreciated unless you surround sound system accommodate it . my advice wait year or so until this movie comes down $9.99 ( which it ) - even though it some fine extras , it just isn't worth current price . best part film ? " songs life " sequence . beautiful song touching moment this otherwise awful film .	-1

rich , sharply observed social satire proceeds farce tragedy logic integrity . what pleasure . although hal ashby , firs t-t ime director , gordon willis , almost new feature cinematography , deserve highest praise their contributions , i split lion share credit film success bill gunn biting , hilarious script perfectly cast ensemble : beau bridges deceptively nuanced deceptively tough role : elgar enders , unmarked , unformed trust-funder whose scheme renovating tenement house into groovy bachelor pad his trial fire waiting happen . his relentless lessons humility would exhausting if they weren't leavened ( dark ) humor . bridges chewed some scenery , he might garnered oscar . it , he opts bewildered spontaneity sure looks like great acting me . elgar mother joyce ( lee grant ) marge ( pearl bailey ) , tenant elgar building , lengthy , hilarious scene over bottle after bottle fortified wine would comic touchstone if only more people knew movie . observes marge : " you get those hamhocks little better if you take those gloves off , honey . " diana sands fanny copee flat out hilarious when script calls it ( broadly pouting , sussed what light touch elgar : " complaints ? well let see ... roof leaks , oven door broke , toilet runs all day , you're awful cute landlord ...

some re-writes this movie bit hard take . while new opening little hard take , it establish animosity fred lily quite well . it also makes " too darned hot " acceptable . censored lyrics not awful , but they rob porter some his depth . katherine grayson rises occasion quite well . her early scene contrived , but after she firm footing . howard keel wonderful . his acting just tad square , but part format time . ann miller dances up storm . , speaking dancing , what treat carol haney , bob fosse bobby van featured dancers . there isn't really complete rendition " openin ' , show " " bianca " cut entirely . but rest numbers come through great . why 4 stars ? partially because cuts . but also color just little fluctuation times . this isn't restored print , but it isn't bad either . i wish they few more 3-d excerpts special stuff . i also they sent some 3-d glasses .	-1

this honestly one best films i've ever seen my entire life . actually it so good , i am compelled write review ....... something i've never before . i first saw this movie home cable . when i started watching it , i really didn't think much it ( almost expected it mediocre actually ) because i hadn't once heard anything good ( or bad ) . i figured movie profound i found out it should least created some sort stir among someone i knew ... i haven't gone through all reviews , so i don't know if this mentioned prior me mentioning it here , but what really struck chord me(and actually what movie teaches you general ) everything happens your life effects you . it affects how you look things future , it affects your confidence , it affects your attitude , etc . okay , maybe this course given but bigger meaning seeing this movie really opens your eyes seeing what always said really true !! especially when you see it front you like . seeing it your face really goes show how individual attitude towards events their live go either one way or . end , life you live go one way or too ;) basically , everything occurs us ... we control how we react therefore how it affects our future . event not control us ; rather we control how event affects us after it occurs . very quantum theory/kabbalahistic/spiritual i would say . i actually plan watching this movie time time ( " what bleep we know ) order keep this important point forefront my mind :)	1
this great story which wrapped entertaining sub-story well acted all . this julia best work my opinion . albert finney always favorite his role here absolutely charming . i would highly recommend this film	-1

i guess i understand why this movie so savagely criticized during it year release , 1986 . prince still enjoying huge popularity based largely success " purple rain , " both film soundtrack . critics love knock someone off pedestal , which what they prince those days . many claimed movie nothing more than ego trip . they couldn't believe prince nerve fire director then assume role himself . it all way too harsh criticism movie isn't trying anything more than fun romantic comedy . course , poor critical response alone doesn't usually keep public making movie popular . yet " under cherry moon " bomb he box office . probably main reason this movie , although shot color , released black-and-white . some unfathomable reason , general movie-going public more often than not horrified prospect seeing black-and-white movie . now don't get me wrong , i'm not claiming movie released color people would flocked it droves . i'm only saying it would attracted more audience if it color . i acknowledge this movie target audience prince fans . since i am one myself , most my life , i'm not most entirely objective viewer . but i make no apologies my love this movie . it not " guilty pleasure " me , because i proudly hold this one my favorites . i only seen it couple times before dvd release - unfotunately i missed it theaters ( i couldn't get anyone take me , i only 12 none my friends into certainly not my parents - though my dad went me few years later see " grafitti bridge " opening night , but that review ) . but since it dvd release 2004 , this become one my most-watched discs my collection . soundtrack killer , tunes make up one best prince albums ever . there even some great stuff heard movie didn't make album ( some which issued 12 " vinyl ) . plus , i think movie looks great - cinematographer michael ballhaus , who multiple academy award nominations his credit ( dp numerous martin scorsese classics ) . i wonder how movie would feel color , but i think black-and-white right way go . even though movie set then-contemporary times , it feel something ' 30s . there so many classic moments this movie , i won't try list them all . but here few ... christopher tracy ( prince ) giving his " bela lugosi eyes " ... tricky ( jerome benton ) tossing rose petals into tub while christopher takes bath ... christopher freaking out when he sees bats eatery ... " wreka stow " scene ... car race christopher mary sharon ( kristen scott thomas ) . acting , i've heard lot people saying prince performance no good . i don't see much truth claim . after so serious " purple rain , " it nice contrast see him so loose funny this . jerome benton proved he could just fine even without morris day his side ( " purple rain " ) - i'm surprised jerome hasn't much additional acting outside prince movies . obviously kristen scott thomas moved this , her first major role , become oscar-nominated , highly repected leading lady . how dvd presentation ? pretty good , such largely overlooked movie . widescreen transfer 2.0 stereo mix aren't anything phenomenal , but get job nonetheless ; movie looks sounds fine . features , anyone expecting full-blown special edition like 2-disc " purple rain " disappointed . but least it not completely bare-bones release - four music videos included , though unfortunately not presented optimal audio/visual quality ( though they passable , i would've preferred 5.1 mixes ) . highlight live performance " anotherlover " which taken never-released ( least not domestically , not sure if it saw light day anywhere outside u . . ) concert video documenting parade tour . mtv held interesting ( i . . - very weird ) contest determine where " under cherry moon " would it world premiere . ten-thousandth caller mtv hotline would accompany prince premiere , which would held their hometown . mtv ran special covered premiere party - unlike premiere " purple rain " unfortunately this program not found " under cherry moon "' dvd release . lisa barber contest winner , movie indeed premiere her hometown sheridan , wyoming - very unusual place big movie premiere . when asked what he thought town sheridan , prince summed it up single word : " purple .

completey utterly unfunny performances oldman roth . stoppard may brilliant playwright but filmmaker he not , botched great potential his play big screen . we get instead literal utterly uncinematic treatment his much-touted play . watching first fifteen minutes " heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , " colossal torture , like status elipticus . it suited stage maybe but never play well big screen . hopes it might pick up , dashed entire film seem lack any momentum or any type cinematic sensibility whatsoever . classic blunder failing recognize two different mediums . don't take my word it , watch it yourself see .	-1
head honcho [ ... ] i watched well over 200 reality/political films give " why we fight " my highest recommendation . this needs shown prime time television ; if it it would prompt thunderous public outcry badly needed government military reforms . it covers facts many don't know united states , like our penchant endless involvement military actions over seas . film launching pad infamous eisenhower farewell speech which he warns america growing military industrial complex . then , unique compelling style it pinpoints famous people , places moments time candid footage revealing quotes ; it also delves into personal perspectives few ordinary citizens affected sept . 11 resulting occupation iraq . it visits key players government exposes what really drives war machine . it looks military contractors congress their incestuous relationship . it also reveals much too influential role so called think tanks play crafting our national policy . addition soundtrack features some great musical talen t.t he information presented this film something every american should know , but they don't know it most part because people who want those war wheels turning don't want people know what they're doing or why . it seems war minded even believe people not any need know . people beg differ . " why we fight " my personal top ten most important movies list which why it would great gift . informing people kind gift really worth giving .	1
this more realistic then some may admit . you see it all time stories tv , reality twisted point where no one knows what truth really , best example michael jackson . everyone their opinions media great tool use if you power get it your side . what this movie all abou t.t he movie depicts evil intentions 2 immigrants trying become movie stars filming their brutal murders . plot pretty original . i don't think i seen any other movie doing this although i may wrong . it interesting how they using hand held camera video lot scenes help realism . you see behind what shown video he shooting . there quite bit satire irony this movie . almost point overwhelming , but overall i recommend this movie anyone who enjoys good cop movie . i would say this somewhat similar movie paparazzi . storylines bit different , but both show how media changes things around make better story .	-1

sudden death i got this movie because i powers boothe fan , came like film itself . it gotten lot poor reviews , but i disagree i think film lot value mainly because chemistry actors . my favorite parts film those interaction emily joshua foss ( powers boothe character , never mentioned name except ending credits . ) duel wits these two priceless this best character ( emily ) powers boothe ever plays against my opinion . i believe it bears much more resemblance two `under seige ' films than `die hard ' its critics claim . children make this film so unique , they big part why characters where they , when they ; why plot unfolds way it . there violence , probably young children shouldn't watch it , but older mature teens might like it because emily tyler . this film deals , least surface level , many issues such government ineptitude , job-related disability , divorce/marriage/child custody , more . powers boothe , dorian harewood , colm meaney terrific villains . powers boothe especially plays great sociopath , low baseline mood , superficial charm emotional distance --- although more insight than most . whittni wright plays emily mccord , nothing listed imdb her after this film --- pity really i would love see more her . ross malinger plays tyler mccord he terrific , i'm happy see he moved good things since . film scored john debney , it his worse piece work ; subdued especially action film , unoriginal , not outstanding any way although believe me i've sat through far worse . there official soundtrack release but good luck finding decent-priced copy . debney went wonderful job `passion christ ' , whodathunkit he got well-deserved oscar nomination it . my gripes : this tenth anniversary we please widescreen release i think we've waited long enough , collector edition powers boothe commentary would nice but i won't hold my breath ... not lot extras dvd , but few good behind-the-scenes items ... idea noone needed go inside or outside stadium during game , or noone would cellphone or there would media blackout something like this really stretches credulity . it worth $10.00 price just good piece cinema history . i would like see prequel or sequel , say , emily joshua foss meeting up someday but now i guess thanks `deadwood ' powers boothe too famous sequel ( foss seemed quite dead film end , but this hollywood after all ) . finally : recently audio book `sudden death ' released audiotape narrated powers boothe , it terrific worth price if you find it . if you disliked movie you might like this audiobook , if you liked movie you'll love this audiobook	1

" throughout time , whenever tyrants arose preached mixture world domination complete intolerance most other human beings , their first targets often small group people noted giving world monotheism , bible set basic laws followed thousands years . " " [ t]yrannical regimes always seem one common link --- their deep hatred jews .

cary grant ingrid bergman make superb team together , it really shame they only acted together once before , " notorious " ( which i would also recommend anyone see ) . ingrid really perfect this role , considering she just reproofed her scandal overseas married man , she shines , especially those moments rare , open comedy ( moment when she screams " how dare he make love me not married man " then shrieks loudy before stomping off into her bedroom hilarious -- not simply because line bit ironic statement , but because you would not normally expect her something nature . ) cary grant , , course , sublime , his cool , ironic british humor cast-off attitude setting off ingrid smiling charms excellent balance , though most charming aspect grant performances he always manages look buffoon , somehow , yet still completely tangible audience . when we find out he lied his married hurt ingrid , we really should sympathizing ingrid over whole affair . yet when he dancing madly around inrgrid dance later , not knowing she aware his secret , he still grins broadly , if knowledge he , always , entertaining completely charming , we can't help but still adore him tha t.t he only thing i found tad daunting this movie camera work , some longer scenes . beginning , you given full view apartment where two lovers meet , granted , it lovely apartment . but after 5 minutes , you really begin wish camera would zoom , or refocus , or something , least , could hold your interest . looking same people same , pulled-out view longer amount time than comfortable really annoying , which shame , because it detracted severely actors ' performances . i really expected more donen , after seeing his work " singin ' rain . " but , then again , " singin ' rain " gene kelly co-director -- probably accounted difference . other than , it completely enjoyable film watch , i would recomment seeing it . dvd superb transfer , color sound really pop out , really showcases ingrid cary their very best	-1

this middle so-called antonioni trilogy focusing alienation emotional deadness modern life . some also include red desert postlude this trilogy . one constant films monica vitti , looking pretty ever , here la notte wearing wig . la notte least three films , l'avventura big breakthrough l'eclisse outstanding finish it quasi avant-garde moments stunning , hypnotic , modernist ending . while la notte might least trilogy , it doesn't mean film poor any measure . it actually wonderful , rhythmically spacious work fine acting mastroianni moreau . monica vitti adds appropriate allure too . mood pacing this film just something one easily fall love . time flies over nearly two hour running time . it practically no conventional plot speak , just glimpse into marriage over one day primarily one night . we also see typical decadent , emotionally sterile bourgeoisie inhabiting background , environment which our lead actors traverse . i enjoyed this film without doubt every time i saw it , but it won't blow you away like it counterparts l'avventura l'eclisse . dvd decent quality but let wait until people criterion get their hands it	-1
william shakespeare play " much ado nothing " extremely funny piece literature . i thought it very cleverly planned out humorously executed . dogberry his men constantly mixing up words their meanings it gave readers comic relief . deceit mistaken identities added so much humor already capturing story . i believe shakespeare main point writing this play show many times , people get worked up over simple miscommunications . you mishear something wrong , or your anger , you tune out someone before getting all facts . all we would need fix certain problem would going source information , but many times we take easy way out . we jump gun little choose believe whatever told us despite our gut feeling information wrong . example this would when leonato heard hero scandalous evening borachio . despite fact she his daughter he would know her better than anyone , leonato believes lies told hero . leonato , her father one who raised her , should known his daughter well enough know she would not dishonor her fianc� herself . especially night before wedding she waiting . instead choosing believe his daughter , who firmly denies any all sexual relationships , he joins claudio , don john , don pedro disgracing her . one lesson learned " much ado nothing " never should people automatically assume something correct . we should " take everything grain salt " - test everything . people world these days so willing lie us readily so without second thought . many times people lied without even knowing someone so . true , sometimes lying deceit all good fun , but it still possibility hurting someone . even innocent lying its consequences . benedick beatrice both believed almost immediately what they overheard their friends saying garden correct completely true . neither person decided test what they heard . see if what said true . because both not check see if information they heard correct , everything worked out . both assumed what they heard true acted it . there no visible consequences . what mess you would if benedick decided what he overheard could not possibly true . beatrice would made fool out herself while thinking benedick felt same way . same could said other way around . i would recommend this play other readers . if people don't like read , then i would not tell others it . combination not liking read difficulty understanding old english would not make very fun pleasurable read . many would miss out humor cleverness shakespeare brilliantly displayed his audience . readers other hand would most likely like this play . humor lightheartedness makes it enjoyable play . i found myself constantly wanting know what would happen next how it would end- how shakespeare would wrap it up . happy ending also nice touch . yes , old english adds challenge reading . sometimes hard understand language makes you stop think what shakespeare trying say ultimately makes you stop realize what he truly trying communicate his audience .	-1

i can't add anything this film wasn't already said more in-depth reviews , but i say movie , it enormous fun . kurt russell , who child star disney , perfect this role snake plissken i can't imagine many other actors who would or could play this role way he . he both very convincing , yet he also appears know this film just pure fun too . john carpenter career very up down . one film dead perfect only followed complete flop . great thing him when he " " director , writer , musician , he very . some other classics his you might want check out original " fog " " thing " ( again terrific performance kurt russell storyline much closer novel ) . both truly creepy films excellent musical scores . they both still stand up well although both relatively poorly box office their time . they later became cult classics vhs dvd . fyi : carpenter also few wonderful non-horror films worth seeing . he directed " music heart " which really earned him much deserved recognition oscar nomination his lead actress , meryl streep . look surprisingly pleasing performance gloria estafan it well . it great story trying teach music inner city elementary kids . he also directed original " assault precinct 13 " suspenseful well-executed cop film , wonderful sci-fi film called " starman " which kind et adults . jeff bridges ' performance flawless earned him oscar nomination	-1

i watched this film part my history studies post-war europe before everyone docks me because i gave it two stars , hear me out . i'm no godard fan so i may not able appreciate this film fan new wave might . i'm just your regular joe movie-watcher . masculin feminin paul , 21-year-old french citizen just retired his 16 months army . paul believer marxism throughout film promotes worker party while denouncing us involvement vietnam , du gaulle government most forms westernism such condoms , psychadelic rock ( many songs masculin feminin style similar kinks , jefferson airplane etc ) even coca-cola ... yet paul often seen playing pinball mini-bowling game you see arcade . paul seems pro-french identity kind guy he often eats cheese drinks wine . preserver romanticized french culture . however , paul friends interviewees ( paul works ifop , major french polling agency time ) seem not care change towards quasi-american consumer state . paul girlfriend madelein rising pop-singer , her room mates materialistic consumers , one who owns car , people paul interviews seem only care themselves . this very accurate terms how ' baby-boom ' generation french youth began rebel against traditionalist governments europe . like teens 1950s us , teens began form their own demographic . however , this where my fascination ends . godard apparently never heard music editing film editing . many parts movie , godard fixed camera one person face portrait shot kept it there minutes time even though scene 15-minute back forth conversation . volume music went very high very low instantly many parts during dialogue , making it very annoying if almost distracting audience . few parts when paul whistling , recording whistling obviously overloaded sound buffer i heard static speakers . i thought this volume problem my end so i turned it down , nope ... it sound editing . this just poor recording editing . furthermore , sound editors this fascination using same gun-noise sound ( which sounded more like cartoon car noise ) over over over again very unlikely times . other times , ambiant noises would drown out dialogue such vehicles outside cafe or even drinking noises . sometimes sound didn't kick up five seconds into scene . because this french new wave film , i won't attack how there virtually no plot random scenes just plain silly . however , i strongly recomend not getting this film if you're just general audience not new wave fan . otherwise , you might like this new wave classic but i'm no expert subject . i just extremely disapointed lazy filming , recording editing .	-1
" sunday , bloody sunday " one most acclaimed adult dramas early 70s , one first major films address gay relationships . murray head stars young hippie simultaneous relationships physician peter finch businesswoman glenda jackson . finch jackson know each other , they even share some mutual acquaintances . needless say , even though finch jackson completely enamored young man , they're also both frustrated his inability give more or commit himself . film explores these relationships over tumultuous week . film directed john schlesinger his follow-up oscar-winning " midnight cowboy . " it solid drama obvious interest its early , relatively non-judgmental depiction gay relationship . note , relationships handled sensitivity but also interesting complex . penelope gilliatt-penned script ( her only film ) top-notch received numerous awards ( national society film critics , writers guild america ) well oscar nomination . finch jackson turn very good performances , which rewarded oscar nominations . although murray head performance often criticized bland , i think his cipher-like qualities works well here ; you're not supposed fully understand exactly what jackson or finch see him . although it reflective its era , film holds up fairly well . overall , " sunday , bloody sunday " interesting exploration adult relationships - straight or gay .	-1

well ... i dunno if you're fan carpenter films or not , but every fan his work tell you his movies age like fine wine . if you like slam-bang action mixed sci-fi horror , i recommend this movie . i'm not saying it best movie ever committed film , but i say i enjoyed it quite bit . it takes while really get moving , i don't mean action-wise ... happens pretty quick ... what i mean conceptually , story didn't really gel me until half-way through , but time before spent character development , so i can't completely shame it there . plot fairly simple ... year 2176 earth teraformed mars colonization ore processing . they haven't worked out all kinks really just kinda stumbling around harsh , alien environment . when mining crew stumbles upon ancient martian artifact , they release disembodied essences former martians who possess bodies anyone they come contact . humans who possessed martians become savage , sado-masochistic beasts who mutilate their flesh kill anyone they come contact . enter into this madness crew mars police officers who unknowingly arriving infected mining town escort prisoner jail penal facility . poop hits fan , police forge uneasy alliance criminals jail against martians . there some pretty good stuff movie : it pretty darn violent ... if you like frequent beheadings belimbings ( i made word up !!! ) , you'd prolly dig this one . makeup effects incredible ... when i say these people mutilate themselves i really mean it ... we're talking screws face , barbed wire cutting into flesh , gashed open mouths , filed teeth ... these things scary lookin ! there one really cool scene shows martians ' memory their former selves mars ages past . i really wanted see more ... here hoping buzz slither its alien flashback scene lives up hype . then there concept itself : enemy can't killed . you kill one them they hop your body continue fight . it kinda staggering . also , this movie felt like it made 80 ... i dunno what it seemed way , special effects up par time it made , but it just flavor . it kinda like carpenter film , assault precinct 13 . wow ... carpenter made " zombie movie " without zombies !!! what didn't work : two words : ice cube . who their right mind ever thought this jackass good actor ? oh ok ... he funny friday ... but that it ! just stop now ... make him go back rapper ... yesterday . ugh . my opinion he stunk up movie royally . i could deal everyone else movie , but he just ... just ... eeeugh . jeez . if they wanted tough rapper guy i'd happier coolio ... least he fun hair ! thing kinda stunk wish my mind it bit more violent gory . i mean ... it ok ... ok , i mean really good ... but i dunno ... i expected lotta violence gore . i think my unrated horror movie collection me spoiled	-1

let me start saying i may need quit listening opinions some my co-workers regards movies watch , least when it comes horror genre . numerous people where i work told me this movie , " descent " absolutely one best horror movies ever made . their defense , my co-workers weren't only people this opinion , many critics other moviegoers said same thing . well , apparently hype built up me regarding this movie more than film could live up , because i sorely disappointed , but more later , now i give you my plot summary last year supposed horror spectacular , " descent "" descent " begins young woman vacation her family friends , when her husband her daughter suffer tragic accident . one year later prodding those same friends , she accompanies them spelunking adventure , problem none her friends ever this cave , fact it newly discovered cave no one explored yet . so they attempt explore unexplored these brave young women become trapped cave . making matters worse , this cave not like any ordinary cave , this one inhabited bloodthirsty mutant creatures who just found their next meal . beginning watching this movie i really interested developing story , shocking opener really caught my attention , giving me sense this movie going different than most horror movies actually giving you unexpected . however , once story gets part where girls inside cave , which actually where majority film takes place , things begin go awry picture . first , filmmakers doing good job using claustrophobic atmosphere , giving audience sense entrapment anxiety which served heighten suspense regarding possibility impending doom . then filmmakers introduce fact i felt completely derailed movie , this cave no one , these girls hardly professional . so , who their right mind would put all their friends lives possible jeopardy just first explore newly discovered cave . it absolutely stupid , especially when placed viewed context character interaction companionship each other , none these girls would this each other . after this occurs mutants show up , plot point i hoping would help put movie back right direction ; however , this where movie begins unwind even faster , because it now just one gory scene after , movie nothing more than your average monster movie . decision i somewhat agreed , yet still didn't agree decision keep mutants origins unknown . one hand this served add mystery why they attacking these girls , you just assume they're cannibalistic , but other it would nice know how they got there . even though " descent " hyped one best horror movies recent time , both my friends many critics moviegoers , me it merely average addition genre already full mediocrity .

sucess popularity bloodsport makes this movie one van damme very best ever . bloodsport also marks van damme first role main character movie . ( previous film he role " no retreat no surrender " which he played villain but much smaller role ) . bloodsport went make 3 more sequals , however without van damme . this first installment overall best , " true classic " , althouh i find certain elements more appealing some sequals . story bloodsport fairly original its time acting not too bad , even though half people this movie seem barely speak english well ( van damme included ) . now when i say not too bad , i'm coming fact i'm pretty hardcore cheesy martial art movies - most baaaaaaaaad acting . great thing story it based true events frank dux ( played van damme ) , who first westerner ever win kumite hold several records . soudtrack this movie , i hate admit 80 film , very nice . i enjoy both original music composed paul hertzog , some songs , survivor i think ( same group who performed eye tiger rocky iii ) . i even enojyed opening credits scene - it sets tone movie wonderfully . real meat potatoes bloodsport , course tournament . there plenty fights , many very short , some don't look very realistic . not many fancy moves , but its always treat see bolo yeung villain , " chong li " , platform . final fight dux chong li lasts 7 minutes , but lot it slow motion some those " now somewhat cheesy flashbacks " early training scenes . end fight showcases van damme leaping spinning split kicks quickly became his signature move seen more his following films including kickboxer double impact . if you wanna see fight van damme bolo yeung , sure check out double impact .	1

yes , this film feels like diatribe . it probably less factual than film version john dillinger exploits director john milius made seventies . so why i recommend this film over milius ' more polished account ? well , this film campy , over-the-top way just so entertaining . secondly , lawrence tierney title role such magnetic screen presence . his tough ferocity keeps film campier elements check grounds it some semblance reality . there also good supporting cast here gangster veterans marc lawrence elisha cook jr.

film days heaven isn't just three migrant workers lonely farmer . there lot deeper meanings involved film . director paid special attention everything film . camera didn't just capture birds nothing . there lot transcendentalist anti-transcendentalist views . majority film made transcendentalist views . example , entire film shot outside showing how beautiful nature . including birds run free field humans . it also always shot dusk or dawn , showing off beautiful sunset . transcendentalist idealistic . therefore , linda transcendentalist . she always loved playing fields always something look forward . linda seemed see good people saw things nature people wouldn't even think . example , when abby , bill , linda escaping river away authorities she saw many beautiful places way related each one something she knew , like shadows rock where people dancing . film also many anti-transcendentalist views . one thing when locus came over took farm . this anti-transcendentalist because nature not work workers or farmers favor . there really no way controlling locus they made farmer go crazy . he already upset seeing abby bill , but decided he going kill bill over it . thing belief good evil . farmer good , but turns evil wanting kill bill after seeing him abby together . example this when bill good man then all sudden he kills man one day steel factory . he then chance start over farm become good , but ends up killing farmer self defense , becoming evil again . bill abby both show signs individuality . they both show this which they both selfish . abby decides marry farmer because once he dies she inherit his fortune she , bill , linda live happily ever after . farmer suppose die few months , but ended up not dying all murdered bill . this could god venting towards bill . it very selfish wrong use farmer his money god got back him not farmer die like he suppose . there many ways person could interpret days heaven . person could think god camera that why some things shot circles all nature . or person could just think it coincidence director not mean anything it . whichever way person decides interpret film , person find film meaningful .	1

ok , check it out , there two jack blacks . one guy tenacious , you see him all time . he funny childish insane . then there other jack black . he evil creature who pervades films like shallow hal king kong , whose only humorous lines ones funny accident . well , long you aren't fat don't feel patronized gweneth presuming know what it like not desired all her life ( ha ) , then all means suspend all disbelief , logic , brain power watch this dumb movie . gweneth fat suit actually pretty convincing , although most movie she played actual fat chick ... who way should just left , without whole " ha ha dude thinks she skinny " nonsense . obviously , film dude trying cope dating big girl would lot more resonance if : ) he weren't brainwashedb ) his fat girlfriend wasn't replaced twiggy blond chick ) movie didn't throw ridiculous concepts your way ( like guy could sex 300 lb woman without realizing it)d ) tony robbins no way involved whatsoeveri knew i slumming it when i saw this movie . but i'm not sure what message this film . jack black character decent , considerate , great kids perfect every way . oh , except he really shallow no dicernable reason , other than his dad dying words him go out chase tail . weird part hal not bad person . movie beats you over head showing you he nicest guy face earth , so you can't really laugh him looking like idiot . rosemary so fat she superpowers . her butt actually creates typhoons ( i wonder if military applications ? ) . suddenly , hal mistakes ugly pimply girls supermodels evil skanks old shrews . tony robbins brainwashed him , fiend ! when hal finally realizes this he decides ( ooh big spoiler ) love rosemary anyway , learns valuble lesson . way there ton cliches like people thinking he dating rosemary just because her dad happens his boss , sexy neighbor his building who starts get hots him when she sees how non-judgemental he dating fat girl (' cause would make any woman melt ) . course there requisite best friend , played jason alexander , who repulsed fat people plots get hal dump her . then again , friend complete troll , so i don't know why hal would want him around . insult us further , they force some burned kids us hospital strike serious note how true beauty inside . too ... many ... public ... service ... messages ! pick ... one ..!! but brain-dead writing aside , paltrow really sells her performance when they actually show her fat suit ( despite gweneth postering when this film first released ) . regardless its clumsy benevolence , i rate this romantic comedy . , i give it rating totally unremarkable . nice gesture , farelly brothers . not bothered	-1
l'argent not only last film robert bresson , it also one his greatest achievements . especially when compared some his efforts 70 ( like ' lancelot lake ) this film shows return genius one associates director ' diary country priest ' , ' man escaped ' , ' au hazard balthazar ' , etc . film brilliantly illustrates how one negative event leads succession other events , gradually leading greatest human folly . this pescimistic look human nature , while it turns some people off , shows realistic yet stylized view life - it cycle karma ( one could say ) . bresson emphasizes smallest details his films - turns us very essence experience	1

inspiring italian movie describes simple , yet profound way basic things life such love , friendship , poetry , magnifisent , unique mediterranean landscape . making this movie massimo troisi dream upon realizing this dream he died just few hours later ; i am sure sence accomplishment satisfaction . humor movie very sublte . right beginning movie massimo troisi , man few words , monologue . this because he talks his alergy sea water his father , who man no words . he lives island where 99% population fishermen he allergic sea water , this funny . one best momments movie when philippe noiret asks massimo troisi describe his island he says : " beatrice russo " , girl he love . but end movie he records what his island : sound waves shore , cry his baby , sound birds , sound wind through bushes . this really what life these things unfortunately escape our notice . resemblence philippe noiret pablo neruda incredible . extras dvd great they really gave me desire visit chile course they made me nostalgic unique mediterranean region . not expect see any special effects movie . but look simple things life make you rich make you become poet . after reading some reviews give only one star this movie i am afraid recommend it case it ends up wrong people . i would recommend it people enjoyed " la vita bella " , " big blue " " cinema il paradiso " ( see my reviews these movies well ) .	1

this film literally sees little wrong child molesting . no , i'm not even slightly exaggerating . it also bizarre i am sole reviewer point this out . janey only 13 year old teenager . she indeed rather mature her age . nonetheless , janey too young legally allow fully grown man sex her . such adult male ( or female ) clearly breaking law . janey daughter woman who selfish undisciplined . father played fool . this dysfunctional family seems doomed . janey younger brother needs her love protection . she capable handling this responsibility ? matters finally get out control ? " rain " morally bankrupt . story line takes place new zealand . perhaps people associated american tv program " catch predator " " perverted justice " should visit this country . david thomsonflares into darknes	-1

that saying alot since he so many great movies . but this one it all . gloved killer , some brutal killings(not like what would come later ) , some very funny scenes interesting characters really surprised me . few words rating though : when bird originally released america back 1970 it edited form . now one must also keep mind there no pg-13 rating back then , it , pg , , x(now nc-17 ) . so this movie got pg it cut form . today it would probably get pg-13 rating . dvd release shown here pg cut film but this company also released uncut version little more violence it some nudity may or may not cut version , i can't remember . anyway , it appears now blue underground , their searches find decent copy this film transfer their dvd release , found very original cut this film including even more violence no one seen very long time . comes out i believe october two disc special edition filled features	1

ralph bakshi part sacred cult filmmakers who driven their passion their art . his films aggressive , non-passive every sense term determined inspire thought reaction . see his films witness images so powerful they seem break through screen enter you . bakshi , working-class hero , always determined let it known he made films very audience . two-fisted filmmaker whose films full kind grunge-poetry , ' graffiti animation ' , bakshi called it . ' heavy traffic ' , his raw-edged , moving , autobiographical film , goes beyond limits art , limits cinema , become part you , reaction audience gives this kind film basic part film itself . bakshi film flies like bukowski poem , some sequences so powerfully unsettling one forgets everything else . his sad , stark images city destroyed something or , recalls marco ferreri haunting images dead ape beach his masterpiece ' bye bye monkey ' .

i'm not sure what this movie . it all hollywood cliches such nude shower scene , older astronaut dies tragically , one astronaut turns other murders him , there man eating bugs , murderous robot , star trek style fight scene where he outsmarts robot his ingenuity . its ironic guy saved russian spacecraft since american movies always make fun russians even though they've put more astronauts space than we ever able . breathable air thing odd . all equipment they forgot check air mars when they landed ? could saved them lot trouble if they stuck post-landing checklist . i thought " mission mars " much better , indicating how bad this movie . mission mars hokey but least it interesting plot	-1
this movie all entertaining . combination " die hard " typical martial arts flick works many levels , but production values hong kong`s , don`t miss point . fans jet li welcome , but action fans careful . here we find scale helicopters burst flames , exploding building models , chopped off dummies , you name it . characters extreme their own context : jet li former military now becomed bodygard stunt actor , loyal , gentleman , honorable , deadly , you know , portrait typical good guy . bad guys also extremely violent cool looking . he doesn't fight or kick much this film , but he shoots lot , dodging bullets dozen bad guys machine guns no scratch all , his revolver shoots 30 bullets without reloading , he drives car inside hall uses elevator , happens right size ... well , you right mood watch this film without laughing many cartoonish production mistakes . but if you into hong kong low production values action films , you really enjoy one best ones 90`s . way , this dvd edition sucks . english dubbed , subtitles , poor sound no extras , not even filmography	-1

i consider plot , actors , acting , special effects believability all top-notch grade a1 quality . i never tire watching this movie whenever i flip through channels see it -- i stop watch it . cast hot , inuendoes cool , it range emotions -- years , i thought games came after movie surpised find out there games same name . there good mix seasoned , experienced actors medium-to-new ones , general tone serious , believable , punctuated joy sadness suspense . it hard not cry during couple parts , when someone dies , or rejected because their religion , even though they try hide it , i even seen it soooo many times , still shed tear ( when someone nice gets picked movie ) . loyalty sacrifice evident film uplifting inspiring . it one you get mad or frustrating if u miss beginning , not because it hard catch-up or follow , because it pretty easy follow , but beacause if you mis beginning then you know missed some good opening scenes few bits detail only add beauty this tapestry . this ultimate classic good one , far outshines starship troopers any day week . i think they should made sequal ( they probably should advertise those games ; i found all but one or 2 them sale try out- awesome ; can't wait ) . definitely movie you might want watch every few months , like breakfast club or one star wars movies , or star trek . beautifully conceived executed . this movie makes you feel like you there , part great , desperate mission save earth . suspenseful parts , ending too . excellent script , acting , emotions . i can't believe someone would not like it	1

i really like william holden early 50's: he fresh , full energy , upbeat , physical - when he put glasses , he born yesterday , intellectual vulnerable . he perfect leading man , very enjoyable watch this film . but real star born yesterday judy holliday , who won oscar her performance . her character , billie , goes through greatest change our story , shows off her incredible range . she starts out dumb-blonde squeeze big-shot con man , harry , played wonderfully broderick crawford , who made his millions junk business , now come washington " buy " senator order help his business . when he drops billie into her first washington social engagement , he realizes he going problems her : she " just ain't couth .

i compelled write this review after i read two reviews written salvadorean perspective claiming this movie essentially complete fiction . although , i haven't seen this movie several years i remember it griping shocking account events largely forgotten ( or even noticed back then ) average americans . i wonder if two salvadorean reviewers ever met or talked boyle , journalist whose experience movie based , or if they ever same places boyle during time . moreover , one key events depicted movie actually happen : december 2 , 1980 four american nuns who there giving aid relief poor people country brutally raped murdered group el salvador national guardsmen . like anything we view or read , stone movies should seen critical eye . course his movie not " ultimate truth " what happened 80 el salvador it should not viewed way . instead , it should viewed what it : one man perspective ( boyle ) what he witnessed while he there . how person perspective or account deepen our understanding history ? what questions it raise ? whose interests perspective ( or other perspectives ) serve ? whether this movie " accurate " depiction not important fact this movie get us thinking talking important issues surrounding justice , freedom , equality role our government overtly covertly plays international conflicts where those values stake	-1

this film powerful effect me . 95% people i know don't read books . i met millionaire not long ago , who boasted me he never read book his life . lady di reported never read anything --- except perhaps fashion mags . my children hardly read , their husbands wives certainly don't . my ex-wife never read anything . her father thought ulysses dirty book . i stopped watching television 1980 , i own 10,000 books --- but not fahrenheit 451 , which i'd read 45 years ago . this long enough me not compare film bradbury text , but message came through movie medium loud clear , very solid punch plexus . manner which it written , played directed , added its impact . this world sleep-walkers perfectly matched what already all around us . style strange , but gradually you realise this strangeness actually what now completely normal . people live work like automated morons . they can't think themselves , their critical faculties almost totally atrophied . they can't conduct stimulating conversation any kind : fact , present them idea , or attempt initiate discussion , they'll often become angry . some several low end reviews this site illustrate precisely what film depicts . ludicrous suggestions : remake it mad mel gibson . infantile spielberg direct it . bulk it out computerised sfx . these ghastly proposals precisely reflect mentality sub-humans which film targets , many them seem unable understand their own language , let alone write it , or spell it . this memorable film , those whose memories still function . unlike captain firemen	1

" house strangers " classic film noir vaults 20th century fox one their very best . under guiding hand brilliant director joseph . mankiewicz film emerged 1949 , remains this day , remarkable piece cinema thanks , no small measure , excellent screenplay philip yordan , low key black white cinematography milton krasner atmospheric score russian composer daniele amfitheatrof . stellar cast headed great edward . robinson . fresh his marvellous johnny rocco houston " key largo " , robinson plays gino monetti , italian immigrant who runs bank he founded new york lower east side . he runs it iron fist he his family four sons who work him , three whom resentful towards their father because poor wages they recieve domineering way he treats them . robinson gino monetti deftly crafted skillful piece acting . just right italian accent actor demonstrates once again he one finest players american cinema . watching his performance here one can't help but think what fine corleone he would made he around(he died 1972 year " godfather " released)richard conte , one his best parts , plays loyal son max monetti his trademark serious look his best oppressed hero style . impressive luther adler oldest wickedest son who what he best - ruthlessness . other two wayward siblings played paul valentine efrem zimbalist jr. romantic interest supplied ever lovely vivacious susan hayward whose star , this time , start its rise . but it robinson movie moment he comes into it . you simply cannot take your eyes off him ! five years later studio re-fashioned yordan screenplay turned it into splendid western called " broken lance " spencer tracy . this fact strangely omitted dvd fact sheet ! curious footnote : end picture we don't hear amfitheatrof finale music . what we get instead end title alfred newman score " razor edge " . why how this should anybody guess ! however , it fine movie fine package which commentary , trailer good behind scenes still gallery . also here , you won't believe , trailer elusive " boomerang " (1947 ) which strangely even weirdly disappeared any listing . classic line " house strangers " - when one robinson errant sons declines help him during his trial - ' i'm sorry pop , i don't want stick my neck out ' which robinson retorts ' why ? what so good your neck '	-1
koreans honor their greatest military hero this epic drama which takes place late 1500s . career tactics this admiral still studied u.s. naval academy , doubtless those other nations . screenplay based couple novels , so there some fiction , but life yi soon shin well documented , so there plenty fact supporting story . if you not familiar korean drama , it good keep mind this not hollywood product , but they very well special effects such considering non-hollywood budgets involved , it easy see past all enjoy tale told . it long series , but presents epic power , depth dimension well worth watching it unfold through each every episode . it would great also see kbs make other dramas available viewing through amazon , such " seoul 1945 " .	1
this challenging piece cinema one greatest filmmakers working today , catherine breillat . fact , it rather redundant call her work challenging because once name breillat mentioned , you automatically assume it challenging . many american critics uncomfortable her work because , methinks , american critics uncomfortable sex . if this film made 1970 , it would gotten more respect . while american general public would stay away film like this regardless critical opinion , i get annoyed when critics dismiss her work pretentious porn . quite often , reviews her work ( this film anatomy hell particular ) usually hatchet jobs her , not films itself . reviewers usually mention certain scenes , but never mention context or their relationship whole film . they don't seem really interested understanding her work . they seem uncomfortable her , essentially their reviews reduced name calling bewilderment . she really gets heart soul relationships . insight she rare any age . this film numerous censorship problems worldwide ( including outright ban australia ) , which me absurd . i seen many breillat films , i recommend seeing them all . this one actually among her more accesible ones , yet , it still make some people scream balk its truthfulness , which scares people more than its explicitness .	1
i watch this video one i own called " mr. robinson crusoe " starring douglas fairbanks because i usually fall asleep almost once , but film enters my brain dreams . i finally saw parts both movies while awake it so strange . " bird paradise " character says nature strongest thing there here more than 80 years later , never more true . if we could sacrifice few people tsunamis earthquakes hurricanes , i lot people i would willingly sacrifice , some even people power or world leaders , world would better place . relationship joel mccrae dolores del rio so magical you even ' forgive ' movie sacrifice dolores del rio volcane because love they , short it . i guess it really better loved well than not all .	1
far films go ... almost best movie i ever seen ... well , i am 18 , but i suspect it doesn't get any better than this . script , filming , acting etc . good ; but what makes movie content . only movie i seen manages portray romantic/married love without maudlin or stupid . relationship more his wife blows me away , especially last scene when he talking custard she screaming he calls her lion . it not typical movie characterization/etc . i couldn't believe it movie . also , it raises issue ' one conscience ' whole issue right/wrong compromise or not compromise . movie isn't pat idealistic ' sass king your thing , brave ' . rather , all manners men shown contrast ; driveling rich fiery nonconformist roper , all manners men . thomas more doesn't fit either catagory . he politician : not scottish covenanter . neither moral " just follow your conscience defy authority " ... beginning movie we see thomas more speak disparagingly martin luther favor ' corrupt ' authorities roman catholic church . thomas more , his principles , ' forced ' king henry execute him ... instead just assenting oath muttering through his teeth like everyone else . movie same . it doesn't just let us conclude ' it right everyone follow their consciences ' . thomas more not simply champion " freedom conscience " . like henry viii we ' forced ' make our own decision thomas more ... he some unbending , deaf rationalizations , uncompromising death fanatic ; par jihadists who detonate israel ? or there really truth out there , while all us busy swearing " succession oath " our times , shaking our heads misguided fanatics ... live successfuly , die our beds ? it makes me wonder	1

original iron chef great thing behold , both because competition intertwining japanese culture . original " iron chef " two chefs - usually japanese - would compete using main ingredient specified eccentric gourmet authority chairman kaga . kaga warlord-like character specially constructed cooking arena called " kitchen stadium " his castle where visiting chefs would compete against his gourmet academy , led his several master iron chefs . chairman kaga himself showpiece flamboyant , heavily decorated coats jackets . show campy charm evoked memories english-dubbed kung fu movies 1970s . iron chef usa entirely too .... american . typical us-versus-them fashion ( note- everyone who not " me " " them " ) competitors stoop anything . judges seem more like competitors " hollywood squares " game show yesteryear than dignified characters original iron chef . japanese judges would anything keep competitors losing face original , it quite comical see them wrinkle up their faces try find something complement dishes they obviously found hard swallow . making fun dishes seems point judges u.s. version . short , skip this entry hold out original " iron chef " come out dvd some day . it truly unique fun show	-1

this derek jarman debut films ( technically , he co-directed paul humfress , but humfress really just there keep things going if jarman screwed up ... luckily , he didn't ) . it actually jarman most homoerotic movie . dialogue latin ( first ... eat your heart out , passion christ fans ) , it street latin , not proper latin . jarman very specific speech because these soldiers ruffians ; they wouldn't speaking queen latin , so speak . many found famous painting st. sebastiane ( which jarman recreates end film ) very homoerotic , so jarman indulges quite freely erotic aspects story . film mythic sheen it , it film you never forget . opening scene roman orgy very memorable . jarman started out ken russell production designer , this orgy scene seems homage him . brian eno music really gives film world feel . not easily offended . there massive amounts male nudity here , but it shown natural , which it . essential viewing jarman fans ( or which i include myself ) .	-1

after growing up leslie ann warren version adoring it child ( singing wrong words all songs all year long until i learned some more next year it appeared tv ) , i hoping magical remake . i little dissappointed how over-produced this version - especially dance number when jason alexander telling town ball . i loved bernadette peters - especially song " falling love love " which gives some interesting backstory her character . whitney houston definitely overdoing it ... someone should reminded her this cinderella story . prince terrific his parents - well , they hoot ! brandy looks pretty sings well , but didn't really come off all sweet or real . many costumes - while gorgeous extremely elaborate - not terribly flattering , especially whoopi whitney which distraction . personally , i'll take leslie ann warren simple flowing fur trimmed ball gown over sparkly brandy version any day . racial diversity didn't bother me all . people making big deal their own issues not belong fairy-tale movie review . many scenes just little too long , few much too long . it would better movie if they tightened it up bit .	-1
truffaut second film after 400 blows , it finds him experimenting all over place . charles aznavour plays charlie kohler , once very prominent concert pianist , but now playing honky-tonk back alley joint . once he thought only his great career , but process lost his wife suicide ( she slept his promoter help advance his career he could never forgive her ); now he wants only obscurity . but he inadvertently gets mixed up couple thugs who after his two brothers , he falls love woman ( marie dubois ) . thugs end up kidnapping aznavour dubois , although two lovers made plans aznavour would pursue his " career " again , fate seems against them : she killed shoot-out end . truffaut said this movie " grab bag . " it seem everything it but kitchen sink : it rooted " " hollywood gangster movies , wonderful mixture comedy tragedy , almost no storyline . fact , truffaut throws storyline wind : it picture touches , quick , fleeting moments , rather than narrative continuity . its juxtapositions wonderful : fame obsurity , love hate , gangsters sense humor , lots action desire go nothing . it great movie - funny sad - one filled many memorable moments . definitely worth watch	1

i think when many say they knew after 15 minutes who killer , they're actually saying they guessed who killer just happened right . think this moment : what motive ? something i never figured out . killer didn't motive . that what threw me off . but i guess some would say crazed killer doesn't need motive . but come ! even deranged killer 7even reason killing . even norman bates reason killing . it could reason explained but i just missed it because movie so terrible . i don't know . i really don't want watch whole movie again figure it out . i know if you lot high profile actors secondary roles , one them killer sure ; but you're thrown off fact you andy garcia , d.w. moffett , sam . jackson . so all 3 fair game	-1

i like all john boorman movies . he way capturing essence time place ; even when it not one we familiar . he very well zardoz . plot zardoz fairly simple but few niches way . it goes like this : man strives create utopia his privileged society . he thinks he succeeded . alas , best-laid plans men , etc . utopia not turn out expected things going awry privileged class . course there outsiders -- " brutals " -- which not so privileged . it through outsider ( sean connery/zed ) few privileged attempt rectify their situation allowing him inside vortex ( where privileged live ) . , course , simplistic view plot . way , it not unlike super-power ( u.s. ? ) keeping brutals ( terrorists ? ) bay . but there always those not satisfied status quo . there more going this movie than meets eye it difficult keep track some niches . one must put together pieces order follow what happening any particular time well why it happening . one things i liked movie : sum parts greater than ending . you may watch movie more than once put parts together . some reviewers criticized cheesy special effects . well , this not star wars or matrix . it not even technically advanced world . not way we know it . it different type technology different culture . that thing i liked it . it new different kind world . zed brought distress disturbance into this world . that what made movie exciting me : zed insurgence into vortex adventure mind well body . he upset changed world privileged he himself changed his interactions them . so end expected , yet , it not .	-1
this movie all entertaining . combination " die hard " typical martial arts flick works many levels , but production values hong kong`s , don`t miss point . fans jet li welcome , but action fans careful . here we find scale helicopters burst flames , exploding building models , chopped off dummies , you name it . characters extreme their own context : jet li former military now becomed bodygard stunt actor , loyal , gentleman , honorable , deadly , you know , portrait typical good guy . bad guys also extremely violent cool looking . he doesn't fight or kick much this film , but he shoots lot , dodging bullets dozen bad guys machine guns no scratch all , his revolver shoots 30 bullets without reloading , he drives car inside hall uses elevator , happens right size ... well , you right mood watch this film without laughing many cartoonish production mistakes . but if you into hong kong low production values action films , you really enjoy one best ones 90`s . way , this dvd edition sucks . english dubbed , subtitles , poor sound no extras , not even filmography	-1
this film aptly compared berlin : symphony city , but what interested me most it its portrayal cinema universally accessible art form . while there propagandistic moments -- celebrating efficiency lifestyle soviet working class -- it easily transcends whatever purpose authorities ( or vertov himself ) may allowing vertov film it . you remember this film composed audience may seen films but certainly not film literate -- not many us now -- which say they not likely aware process making films , or reflected much nature film . what so exciting this film it presents both portrait city , life its inhabitants , well documentary ( self-reflexive ) study art filmmaking . there much learn this film different ways thinking film , i often show it my film classes this purpose . there idea film recorder objective fact , potentially present anywhere though always located somewhere , suggested images filmmaker kind eye towering over city , seeing both whole parts . there also idea film highly subjective , suggested images show personal reaction filmmaker , images show personal dangers faced " man movie camera " his effort capture difficult shots . we see , these shots , film not simply passive recorder events unfold independently filmmaker but also involved creation these events . we see editor , editing very footage we just seen filmmaker recording . we see filmmaker kind poet , making use visual metaphors suggest ideas : train relay suggests intercutting various scenes editor , window eye suggest camera . we also see capacity filmmaker manipulate create new reality , when we observe animation ( camera itself , seemingly taking life its own without cameraman ) , but we also see how this animation achieved . we even shown audience itself , implication included very picture we watching . some these metaphors ideas may seem heavy handed today , but only my description them . when you actually watch them they fascinate . editing also superb this film -- always appropriate scene it sometimes slow , sometimes more rapid kinetic than anything mtv produces . all all , i consider this essential piece cinema , well worth purchasing dvd while it still available . i hope it remains print forever , but hard time believing it , which why i just recently purchased personal copy -- when it already owned my campus library . ( picture dvd quite fine , better than vhs copy i seen ; music re-created notes left behind vertov superb fits film quite nicely .	1

huge fan this director , it no surprise i recommend film ... but only if you tolerate extremely challenging cinema . if you like films make you feel happy alive , this isn't you . if you like films don't make you think , this isn't you . much written film violence rape scene . less written ways director makes you feel uncomfortable ( sound , camera work lighting effects ) . trust me , it all works , if you good sound system or prone seizures you may just want stay away this one . noe likes dealing mass manipulation through things like film , this movie no exception . its violence rape scene don't make this effective film , however . it what leads up it ( reverse order , course . ) naysayers easily dismiss this film vile , they right . but it also honest unafraid . dismiss it without seeing it , however , shows how little some people know . you can't help but moved what noe doing , he isn't trying move you positive way . he making statement , it statement says revenge hideous sometimes necessary ; men beasts ( that sometimes saving grace ); people don't make most time they given . vile ? maybe so . but so ignorance	1

carole bouquet thinner conchita who somewhat severe . angela molina one who dances seems more natural . jean-claude carriere wrote script . he may greatest screenwriter all time . he over hundred credits some them among best movies ever made . here brief list those i seen : ogre ( 1996 ) , valmont ( 1989 ) , unbearable lightness ( 1988 ) , discreet charm bourgeoisie ( 1972 ) , diary chambermaid ( 1964 ) . there some symbolism cet obscur objet du desir . sometimes mathieu ( fernando rey ) carries around old gunny sack . we find out what it final scene . it represents conchita virginity . terrorists background seem rather contemporary although this movie 1977 . mathieu rich therefore represents established european society . conchita her friends represent underclass . both mathieu conchita really character types . he masher , rake who always working new conquest , although he somewhat naive . she tease who uses her wiles get what she him . bunuel plays this ancient theme burlesque , exaggerating her coyness his foolishness . ending may suggest some way he won , or more likely they still standoff , even while terrorists escalate bombings . question why there two actresses playing conchita more maria schneider , who originally cast role , but left because nudity or because conchita character too contrary , than it any plot or symbolic necessity . other hand , since she " obscure object desire " ( which really should " unobtainable object desire " ) , because bunuel wanted emphasize mathieu desire her nothing her personally , he used two actresses made it clear mathieu didn't notice difference ! bit absurdity here , but bunuel comfortable absurdity . all all interesting treatment ancient theme , but not one bunuel best , even though it his last age 77	-1
moonlight whispers surprisingly sweet tale two japanese teens whose first forays into young love escalates into sm relationship . it sort like endless love if it directed andrew blake . takayu satsuki teenagers going same school friendly since they both become members kendo club . takayu hiding deep crush satsuki , when she reveals she always liked him , two begin dating . although it seemed what he always wished , after two lose their virginity each other , takayu finds he not interested her normal sexual fashion . takayu more comfortable subservient . when satsuki discovers his drawer full pictures her , articles her clothing , audio tape her going bathroom , she initially sickened shocked . she begins dating classmate , uematsu , but takayu continues follow her insist he wants her obedient dog . satsuki finds she gets pleasure out cruel him , soon two begin strange relationship , struggling their perverted desires . ultimately , this remarkable film , unlike any i've seen before ( it makes you want seek out more foreign films ! ) , i mesmerized it . not soft porn or exploitation film all but sincere sensitive exploration character , psychology taboo subject -- intensely romantic . also this dvd interview young director , which also quite interesting . after ' losers club : complete restored edition ' richard perez , moonlight whispers best " unconventional " purchase i made amazon this year .	1

don't know why my first note hasn't appeared , so i'll briefly restate . claim-to-fame this film it avant-garde , push-the-envelope sexuality . amazon describes this film " unrated " , but that not what nearly all these listings selling . these new " " rated version massively redacted . fact , all what makes this film famous reduced some brief nudity . even though box continues bill it " sexiest movie ever made . " top , despite english only cover , my vhs purchase subtitled spanish . seller offered adjustment . he didn't know . but amazon needs drop ' unrated ' description , implies original . those still interested might look something like ' director cut ' . i still haven't found one . sorry if this duplicate previous post	-1

regarding andrei rublev , debate which official cut . criterion dvd comes what they call scorcese version which 30 minutes or so longer than ruscico version . however , ruscico version actually edited tarkovsky release . i would go both cuts see how two movies differ . you experience how cleverly movie edited without any compromises . ruscico version what you get all over world . i prefer ruscico version . events more discontinuous but stronger effect . example , beginning three monks walk away monastery due ideological differences start walking across field where it starts rain . crterion version you see this entire event . ruscico version tarkovsky cut out scenes where they walk away monastery just starts three walking field . you dont know where they came where they headed . this gives different effect when seen . all you see they talk walk rain . criterion cut you dont experience this effect much but just tend follow thread things . overall criterion cut tends definite thread things , sense it more straightforward filmmaking . ruscio more artful version two	-1

" technically third movie series , " inspector clouseau " finds alan arkin title role french inspector jacques clousea , character peter sellers started make famous two previous movies character sellers would become inextricably linked four more afterwards . " inspector clouseau " lacks boundless energy director shawn levy actor steve martin 2006 entry franchise or subtle sophistication any director blake edward actor peter sellers ' indisputable classics , but director bud yorkin actor alan arkin entry undeniably unique actually quite entertaining .

woody allen purple rose cairo ranks among his better films . film centers experiences poor woman named cecilia who played wonderfully mia farrow . cecilia trapped loveless marriage brute named monk who played danny aiello . cecilia job waitress small diner during depression although she tries work hard she can't help but fantasize chat movies her sister who also works same diner . cecilia only comfort movie theater watching glamorous but highly contrived movies rich people who aren't suffering poverty scorn her husband . cecilia eventually loses her job after catching monk unfaithful her she winds up watching purple rose cairo endlessly small movie theater their town . imagine cecilia surprise when one characters , dashing all-american type guy tom baxter , decides leave film , jump screen into audience , run away cecilia ! tom represents purity heart true compassion cecilia longs her real marriage . she knows tom fictional because he came off movie screen ; but tom maintains he never going back because he wants experience real world cecilia his new bride . course , all this horrifies movie theater manager hollywood studio produced film entitled purple rose cairo . how inconvenient this gil shepherd , too , actor who portrayed tom baxter film ! movie studio executives gil shepherd hatch plan get tom return movie -- but it work ? what would happen if tom returned movie but took cecilia him into land make believe ? purple rose cairo film you cannot afford miss . mia farrow cecilia , danny aiello monk , cecilia husband jeff daniels both gil tom all give some most convincing performances i've ever seen . their performances moved me engaged my attention much longer than i initially thought they would . this movie deals universal human desire escape pain boredom everyday life so many us experience replace misery world which there no real problems everyone money or very least secure job . cecilia represents us all she delights tom world relative innocence harmony . therein lies true strength this film . cinematography shines : i like scenes movie house where you see film screened within woody allen picture . scenes filmed amusement park reflect careful forethought concerning lighting camera angles . choreography amazes me : i love scenes which both movie theater patrons actors film stunned tom decision leave movie they all move simultaneously ways prove good judgment part woody allen his colleagues who worked this film . overall , purple rose cairo remain excellent film long human condition quality our lives imperfect . everybody dreams world where their true desires reality their troubles disappear . purple rose cairo elegantly explores this theme sophistication , wit poignancy .	1
this movie should great but misses widely . it all woodyesque elements whimsy , absurdity , profundity , pathos comedy but it never really comes together . farrow chattering , self-absorbed housewife not very sympathetic , since she practically every scene , movie feels weighted down this poorly written character . pacing seems awkward too . allen best movies almost always daring go-for-the-jugular-forge t-t he-critics air them . like too many his almosts , alice seems like practice movie . if allen unwilling wholly commit his own material just go it	-1

this sad , great , superbly acted movie struggle dominance scottish regiment after wwii . colonel jock sinclair ( alec guinness ) named acting commander his regimental battalion now expects confirmed . he up-from-the-ranks officer , hard drinking , bluff but sly , whose whole life regiment . he demands loyalty manliness his officers . but he isn't confirmed . coming replace him battalion commander colonel basil barrow ( john mills ) . he everything sinclair dislikes , aristocratic , privileged , military family . he also something martinet , man who prizes decorum his officers , man who prisoner war returned shaken . something weak man . stage set barrow try take moral command batallion , sinclair undermine him every step way . result both men , their own weaknesses , destroy themselves . number elements makes this , my opinion , powerful motion picture . setting batallion headquarters scotland , located towering , massive stone hulk building reeks tradition . it winter it cold , it perfect setting struggles going . customs regiment , playing pipes , all underline closed-in atmosphere this all-male society . cast excellent , actors playing soldiers ncos officers . dennis price , first-class actor , cool enigmatic battalion exec who may pick up pieces who may not so disinterested he appears . guinness mills extraordinary , both playing against type . while guinness flashier role , mills brings such depth well-intentioned weakness match equal two . you wind up understanding both men sympathy both . most all , i think , story . it fascinating look inside regiment , tied story real power tragedy these two men ruin their lives . this great story telling great acting . i recommend movie . criterion disc first rate . among other extras , it features excellent interview director , ronald neame , which he describes filming movie	1
this landmark film 1984 dark interpretation well known fairy tale legend , red riding hood . it focus splendid settings including murky dense forests , wooden cottages where villagers live fear danger posed man-like beasts prowl night during testing freudian times . film composed several scenarios where vivid dreamlike sequences take shape creating very unusual altered perception man ability determine grasp fantasy reality . every scene well thanks execution film direction neil jordan whose original thinking imagination led superb adaptation based angela carter " bloody chamber " book . dark , spooky atmosphere this classic fairy tale re-telling blessed use ancient folklore old wives tales which hint casting spell or curse anyone who uncivil others or society . angela lansbury who plays grandmother spins such stories young rosaleen , pre-pubescent teenager who go journey self-discovery both emotionally physically unravel hidden delights adulthood . despite such tales , girl unaffected her courage takes her unknown paths through dark woodlands where her character judgement tested forecast her values beliefs she behold adulthood . interactions unknown strangers , mostly men whose eyebrows meet middle lend itself powerful experience innocent teenager . general , this film more fantasy where excessive blood gore barely feature , instead portrayal genuine , well-mannered men their hidden devilish , cunning personality most threatening aspect difficult predict when one may strike . most modern vampire/werewolf stories , main attraction ensures film success character humour neatly stirred give all viewers general taste feel scary not too scary moments mixed into plot . stephen rea performance early film when he returned home filthy , long-haired , smelly hippie after sometime spent outdoors wolf overturned dining table during argument - remember same thing occurred 1994 " interview vampire " movie when hacked-off silly , bearded , overweight rogue lost card game ! well beautifully rendered scenes , music well composed which suspenseful adds eerie , tense atmosphere giving sense something always happening there always darkness never daylight . best thing this film no one could trusted anyone who thought they'd make good friends someone sure big surprise ! friendly seductive but sinister terence stamp example . constant nagging , bickering annoyance mainly women towards their husbands or girls constantly rejecting sexual advances seemingly-friendly strangers leads which drive man desire anguish frighteningly transform into werewolf full moon . this message film sending out men during those times always one charge , care should exercised whenever household arguments or disagreements broke out prevent ultimate beast unleashed within himself should dispute , whatever it may turn too ugly . human-to-werewolf transformation scenes well filmed hand-crafted 1984 convincing using remote-controlled models wolf-like beasts , but compared today standards scenes shown signs ageing . however my opinion , overuse today computer generated images could spoil horror film making certain scenes look corny or just not believable . dvd presented beautiful tin box which reflects show class . this now becoming rarity , dvd now commonly sold standard plastic box which cheaper if purchased on-line . it shown 4:3 aspect ratio but not 16:9 widescreen stated box good range extras especially expert 90 minute audio commentary available , but very well worth buy . apart dvd film disc , there excellent booklet included detailing events took place behind cameras , well history folklore legend wild beasts , character descriptions actors ' biographies brief , all explained colourful photographs taken film . running time 90 minutes , but i felt it should 2 hour-plus epic . it also rated 18 suitable adults only . it box delight should treasured forever . best effect , watch this alone dark before bedtime	1

one his essays german philosopher/critic walter benjamin compared film theater stating lens camera replaces audience spectator , but because camera emotionless actor unable feed off audience reaction . however , some films theatrical aspects not only used , but become part film itself . anyone who watched ichikawa kon actor revenge or shinoda masahiro double suicide this quite evident . while not taking theater into play , im kwon-taek extraordinarily popular film chunhyang incorporates traditional storytelling elements pansori , singer drummer , into play . instead just opening film , viewer treated listening pansori storytelling throughout entire film even his voice overdubbed over actors actresses . while this aspect film might bit distracting first , especially when film action cut stage visualized world chunhyang , it eventually sinks one enjoy told story while seeing it acted out actors actresses instead just realm inside one head . chunhyang tells story lovers lee mongryong sung chunhyang , former sun governor namson latter daughter courtesan . budding scholar who preparing exams would open him world officialdom , mongryong one day becomes bored his hours constant study asks his servant pangja show him some areas local interest . one spot he notices beautiful young girl swinging high swing he falls love first sight . he orders pangja fetch girl him , but servant reluctant because chunhyang reputation turning down every man who shown interest her . however , pangja go speak her , but instead returning girl he returns message mongryong interprets chunhyang wants him come visit her her home . night he visits chunhyang , girl eventually agrees marry him promise he would not abandon her because their differences social status . he agrees so so they marry they seem quite blissful first until mongryong father receives promotion which requires him return seoul . because mongryong return seoul his father because he cannot take chunhyang him , because married such lowly girl would destroy his chances taking exams , young couple must part , but mongryong promises return chunhyang after he finishes exams . however , during time mongryong away , new , corrupt governor takes over old governor position he seems interest our heroine . directed man who considered many father modern south korean cinema director nearly one hundred films , chunhyang might not first seem no more than simple love story , but its elements traditional storytelling , its intermingling history , romance , melodrama , it stand out great film within ever growing number spectacular south korean films .	-1

3.5 stars . i liked this movie heck lot better than original . however , battle mothers definitely go angela lansbury over meryl . not meryl bad job , it just angela outstanding . this movie filled little more holes me-though i find overall premises still far fetched ending wholly unbelivable . still-a good rental	-1

this one my favorite movies long time . recently i happy see it dvd which relief watching old , grainy vhs versions . i hadn't seen it years watched it today find myself amazed how well movie stands up time . it one those rare , perfect storms comedy where great writing ( truly funny line after truly funny line ) paired great direction outstanding performances all same time . dudley moore got oscar nomination " arthur " but lost ( although john gielgud won best supporting actor ) . if moore performance " arthur " doesn't win best actor oscar -it proof no comedic actor could ever win title ( example gene wilder " young frankenstein " ) . steve gordon crafts film beautifully keeping true each characters warm-hearted tone story . quite simply , imho movie rare gem . it only sad steve gordon passed away just year after " arthur " released . regarding dvd , it so/so . although video quality leap over old vhs copies , there still no widescreen version available . dvd few extras nice but it just not enough . one example commentary director stating how he greatly wished how certain deleted takes scenes could included ( because they hysterical ) , but he make tough choices final edit . dvd , perfect format include such material , certainly should offered it well . this , original " arthur " , classic comedy one books	1

i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1
this horrible movie no redeeming value . i realize such knock actually drive people purchase this . let me bring something you attention . this slasher movie effective gore . fact , time , gore more sick similar movies . however , there no scares , no suspense , no clever script , no story it stupic ending . i know , applies most gore movies ! problem this movie it overly mean spirited towards women ( i am man , 6 foot 235 pound big strong guy also raises family ) . story , which guy killing women b/c mistreatment his mother , seems like it written directed person shares same demons killer film . murders this movie so mean-spirited ( yet no cinematic value ) normal movie goer would offended . this movie not sick " good " movie way but rather sick ashamed manner . this woman-bashing movie should make any viewer feel guilty they patronizing this garbage . movie should entertainment value . there no cinematic , artistic touch this film . this simply mean , mean movie !	-1

ub iwerks . rights , very unusual name should equal walt disney . brief time , it . yet ub little remembered today , despite fact he true creator mickey mouse . he certainly far better draftsman than walt , technical genius who succeeded every endeavor he ever tried -- animation , archery , even bowling . everything , , except one -- escaping imposing shadow his old friend onetime partner walt disney . directed ub granddaghter leslie iwerks narrated kelsey grammer , this documentary takes us through various twists turns ub career . it one distinct advantage over iwerks/kenworthy book -- one see oneself extent ub genius through his work , presented on-screen first time decades . we see first primitive efforts he walt produced young commercial artists kansas city -- " laugh-o-gram " films " alice cartoonland " series . we also treated rare clips silent " oswald lucky rabbit " series ( far superior later ones walter lantz ) . course , earliest mickey mouse cartoons ( two which , " plane crazy " " steamboat willie " , shown end film , animated almost exclusively iwerks ) . seeing films , ( particularly ones he made independent producer ) one gets impression there some pretty strange things going ub head . his best work , most which produced before hollywood crackdown film morals , surprising edge it . one his cartoons independent ( he left form his own studio thirties ) st. peter heaven buzzed speeding motorist , whom venerable saint promptly gives " finger !

" only flaw this production it skips over some aspects his career , particularly brief period he assisted cartoon producer leon schlesinger making two porky pig cartoons . would reunite iwerks one-time studio cel-washer chuck jones , who states film iwerks one who got him interested animation . oversight understandable , given this documentary disney studio , not likely give competitors any free publicity . ub often unfairly portrayed animation histories more interested gadgets than art , he seem most home coming up new technical advances film . earliest multiplane camera ( device designed give dimension cartoons ) travelling matte process among his greatest achievements . but it likely he lost interest animation after mickey mouse because there nowhere else he could go . one man who knew him quoted saying ub , taken up bowling , put his ball closet after bowling 300 game , never use it again . mickey , ub already " bowled 300 " sense , sought new areas conquer . conquer he . returning walt 1940 after ten-year estrangement , he immediately set work devices would make disney animated world more real than it ever . donald duck cavorted latin senoritas dick van dyke danced animated penguins aid devices invented ub iwerks . even after winning two academy awards technical achievement film , ub retained his characteristic modesty . mickey mouse , he would say , " it not creating ( character ) matters , it what you it .

supremely dark losey film starring incomparable dirk bogarde , who takes what you think going routine " blank-from-hell " role turns it completely it head , insinuating everything doing nothing overt ..... making what he actually so much more deliciously evil . some shots here instanious classics still amaze ( shot james fox his fiance busting bogarde his sister , revealing only continually clarifying silhouette bogarde standing naked stair landing , while fox stares up , both appalled enthralled ; fox shivering silhouette he hides bogarde behind shower curtain deceptively innocent " game " ) . pinter script admirably daring , though it turn bit too fast melodrama allegory my taste --- it still pinter , all more brilliant it regarding pace , timing , -- course -- dialogue .	1

" koyaanisqatsi " took seven years make , 1975 1982 . there not narration tell you what think . this art film , my opinion , value up viewer : this film meaningful ? it value ? viewer i say yes . this film fusion music image . koyaanisqatsi there 17 pieces music five movements all relative relationship one . " grid " polyrhythmic piece music . there 11 polyrhythimic structues going once , it matches time lapsed photography occuring screen . 350,000 feet film shot . there definitely method this madness : after explosion grid , these polyrhythmic structures settle audience down film ends way it began : rocket ship taking off . godfrey reggio more than expected negative reaction some people when he made this film . what this film mean ? up viewer , like piece art work there may thousand or more interpretations related this film . this film only certain individuals ? probably . but i don't think there any pretense interpretating this films message . one not pretend like or dislike art object ; it no intrisic meaning or value only what ascribed it viewer . godfrey stated koyaanisqatsi related northern hemisphere societies ; super-sophisticated , hyper-industrial , technological grids we call societies . me this film how humans become one machines . how we don't live nature any longer . we become not affected technology so much more we become so engrained it we no longer see out it . technology becomes host which everything happens way , we not use technology , it way life . but like air we breath we not distance ourselves , we deny we separate technology instead moving us toward control nature it alienated us instead . norms nature no longer fully exist ; it rather norms technology . so doing technology become omnipresent . personally i don't pretend like this film or pretend it important . fact it , its message perhaps even more significant today world moves even closer homogenized society expense natural human diversity . this film shows homogenization this process globalization	1

wiktor grodecki brave filmmaker , one who unafraid address controversial subject , yet one who able make powerful sociologic statement creating metaphorical art film demands respect . grodecki interviews young boys ( ages 14 - 17 ) who male hustlers prague : he wisely removes ( most part ) interviewer questions allowing individual boys make spontaneous , searing comments . these young lads discuss why they became male prostitutes , how they deal selling their bodies , where they find their business ( train station , swimming pools , etc ) , how they feel johns their fellow hustlers , manner which they business including way which financial aspects come play - all way burns faces these young lads into our psyches . half way through this film grodecki introduces pavel rousek , man who day pathologist performing autopsies prague morgue his off hours ( using pseudonym hans miller ) creates , casts directs gay porno videos his home . rousek shown autopsy table gowning , gloving , grotesquely performing autopsy real cadaver while discussing both professions . there moments while he gloving he explains why he doesn't allow his boys wear condoms ( buyers his videos don't want see condoms ) , contrast his self protection vs enforcement prevention sexual protection his actors devastating . rousek miller then shown filming boys his home , explaining details achieving visual effects pornography : simultaneously we again hear boys views aspect their ' careers ' , creating pitiful tension . there almost no total nudity this film when it occur lighting so dark obscure it - making overall effect even more dense effectively tense . under all this lurid talk grodecki uses classical music - albinoni , mahler , mozart - which again provides contradiction makes topic digestible . final question grodecki poses his subjects involves boys perception ' soul ' while there variety responses , overall message these lads sell their bodies career , but soul ' what you think ' , something cannot taken you . several these boys screen presence faces , they noticed regular film makers , would probably give them legitimate careers . but power film comes words these boys , knowing completely their choice life , therein lies sorrow . this tough but very fine piece filmmaking . interestingly , grodecki absorbed this material used it create his subsequent feature film mandragora ( reviewed under title ) . this film more powerful two . not movie everyone , but certainly important document way life few know fewer understand . grady harp , september 05	1

i bought punisher when it originally came out so now i both original dvd its new extended cut . film itself , i liked original but new extended cut what it should . it gives film whole new look missing before ! i won't give it away but it new subplot makes film make more sense ( much like director cut daredevil ) makes it better my view ! personal note , those says its nothing but mindless violence it no regard human life obviously didn't watch film or read comics ! yes , there gory violence but this isn't freakin ' spider-man ( though i enjoy character movies well) ! punisher isn't nice character . i am not married nor i children but if my wife son ( my extended family ) gunned down front my eyes , i don't think i'd such positive attitude either . also , frank castle isn't so hellbent he can't see suffering around him . if so , he wouldn't helped joan ( played rebecca romjin ) creepy boyfriend hers or befriend ( sort ) joan her friends or left " gift " he left so note , frank castle wasn't totally twisted . anyway , back dvd , it animated beginning both film seperate . also , there 10 minute short explaining new extended cut well classic punisher covers comics . i would also recommend keeping original release extras ( it some good ones too ) . overall , if you stand violence comes , its good film	-1

james stewart masquerades hangman order save his brother , dean martin , leader notorious bishop gang . they then flee mexico beautiful hostage raquel welch . george kennedy plays lovelorn sheriff who pursues half-hearted posse . everything this 1968 western works ! first 45 minutes involves capture , attemted hanging , escape bishop gang , it simply one most memorable sequences western film history . some people complain stewart martin brothers but i've seen many brothers real life look more different than these two . even though martin plays outlaw he portrayed highly likable , sympathetic manner . he weary outlaw lifestyle desperately wants out . stewart welch offer him way out way stolen money true love respectively . they all dream new life montana . there just two problems : kennedy his posse wild mexican bandits ( bandeleros ) . although there some fun elements , film essentially serious western adventure/drama . it potently explores themes loyalty , temptation , pursuing finding true love , folly criminal path dreams better life . some complain ending too downbeat , but i've always loved it . fact , it wouldn't right it end any other way . [ spoiler alert ! ] it powerfully supports age-old notion those who live sword ( stolen loot ) eventually die sword . i must say george kenney outstanding stolid sheriff who puppy-love passion welch . she naturally finds him unexciting , however . hostage bishop gang she slowly discovers true-love first time her life ( martin , course ) . score jerry goldsmith outstanding . jerry obviously borrowed basic melody neal hefti magnificent composition " duel diablo , " which released two years earlier . goldsmith took basic melody ingeniously created completely different-sounding score . his composition fun western vibe it whereas hefti ultra-dramatic . both these scores rank up there all-time best western musical soundtracks , which include " good , bad ugly , " " how west won , " " mackenna gold , " " fistful dollars , " " rio lobo , " " bonanza " " magnificent seven . " too many western films take place texas but filmed elsewhere ( like arizona , etc . ) . " bandelero ! " contrast , actually filmed brackettville , texas , not far mexican border/rio grande ; some portions shot utah . these locations fabulous . " bandelero ! " western film-making highest order .	1

this ideal movie home theatre . i grew up working ranch richard farnsworth , james caan jane fonda totally convincing cowboys cowgirl . jason robards utterly evil this movie . i've liked them all several other movies but none good this one . breathtaking backdrop really well written story combined excellent array talent makes this one treasures my western collection	1
if you liked crouching tiger , hidden dragon , then see bride white hair . drawn same sword sorcery tradition , both movies feature strong female leads . case bride , we brigitte lin ching hsua , one hong kong most popular female stars . brigitte beautiful compelling ; more fey than zhang ziyi , she sorcerous assassin top her game . her meeting male lead , leslie cheung ( singer-actor best known us his role chen dieyi farewell , my concubine ) either accidental or destined , depending how you look it , but it changes her world his . visual style film spectacular , thanks no small part cinematographer peter bao . director ronny yu yan-tai , who compared ridley scott , not very well known united states yet , but he got pretty good following world-wide . ( yes , yes . he directed bride chucky . i'm not going defend or attack him , because i've never seen it . ) bride he conducts , like best fantasy hong kong masters , opera or ballet . every word , every move larger than life , everything fraught meaning , promise or threa t--t his not " everyman " action ; this epic . like many epics , it sometimes suffer excess . bride , my opinion , not quite good humanizing its characters tiger . both romeo juliet stories , but lin lien ni chang cheung zhou yi hang not fully rendered star-crossed lovers tiger ( either pair ) . they're archetypes . but they're grand glorious archetypes . who cares lien ni chang raised wolves who somehow taught her mastery wind instruments ? who cares how precisely villains came their genetic-defying bond ? isn't point this film , people who allow themselves bog down these issues , i believe , depriving themselves transporting film experience . go willing enjoy , you probably . those disturbed loose ending tiger , warned : bride isn't likely satisfy you much more . if " what then ? " haunts you too much , you find answer bride white hair ii . it returns all major characters picks up where other left off	1

i enjoy genre over top gore comedy but this one didn't interest me . story very slow paced uninteresting some pretty unimaginative gore . it also ridiculous not comedic way but ' stupid ' way . people smashing through stone walls lot . final ' ultra ' gory finale really didn't interest me either . watch troma terror firmer or citizen toxie if you enjoy this type movie . or wait poultrygeist which probably pretty tromariffic . i don't know when this made but i would guess it inspired troma . i appreciate effort but it didn't match let alone surpass troma gore comedy	-1

honors thoughtful well little " slice life " moral we've all heard before : what makes you happy take time live your life . director alex keshishian screenwriter william mastrosimone , however , don't knock you over head its theme and/or morals . there some scenes where you're expecting probable happen they don't: e.g. , after simon cooks gorky , rooster , you expect his master furious --- when simon finally meets up son he abandoned , you expect some kind tearful reunion ---- you certainly think monty going graduate honors . end results these scenes , however , avoid usual cliche . joe pesci delightfully understated his role , although he never really becomes coochy coo loveable , you understand his pains shortcomings ; brendan fraser starts out pretty snooty insufferable but he matures his relationship both pesci moira kelly ( who delightful courtney ) , fraser becomes more sympathetic character ; patrick dempsey adds some lightweight humor gorky master , josh hamilton eschews usual pain butt role believable touching change hear t.t he movie definitely manipulative , but its heart right place its cast takes it seriously , so it ends up charming little film strong reaffirmation human spirit	-1

" horse mouth " one those british comedies bring smile your face if you already love those kind movies television shows , indispensible dvd fans great alec guinness . he plays gulley jimson ( who novel author , joyce cary , based his friend poet dylan thomas . ) jimson broken-down , scabrous old reprobate artist , who also recognized those know genius . dressed shabby old clothes , guinness scowls , sneers , growls unforgettable voice , insults everyone , schemes plots his next big painting . he supported nosy , young would-be artist , coker , tough old barmaid who likes jimson spite herself . jimson worms his way into apartment upper-crust couple paint his mural their wall " resurrection lazarus " , hilariously catastrophic results . while fleeing police , jimson discovers bare wall old church scheduled demolition , tom sawyer-like , recruits army apprentices paint his next big mural , " last judgement . " guinness wrote screenplay , it criticized some softening novel , especially ending . but this movie perfectly reasonable interpretation perhaps reflects guinness ' religious faith ( check out titles paintings , coker prayer , jimson last line film . ) some described gulley sort proto-hippie , but there nothing soft , sentimental , or utopian him . he tough-minded , self-critical anarchist whose faith world besides this one , " world color " , carries him through his troubles . jimson stands incorrigible individual against small-minded materialistic elites hate fear real beauty because they hard time understanding it . this wonderful movie deserves its high reputation inclusion criterion collection dvd .	1

let me start off saying i enjoy book " shining " read it few times when i younger . stephen king obviously incredible author gift capturing mood clear concise writing . he not , however , brilliant writing screenplays . his dialogue so bad sometimes it makes it hard tell if actors ( mostly child who played danny ) really bad or if it just script . also , i realize this actually mini-series not feature film , but king felt need not only include every detail book ( including laughable hedge animal scene ) but even added more parts not included book . addition this problem , there countless times jack would character beaten ready kill only stop say " it time take your medicine " or " you little pup " person inevitably escaped . these two factors served drag movie so long all feeling urgency lost , leaving climax pretty anti-climactic . i know many people prefer " stephen king shining " original movie simply because it more true book , but compare new cheesy hedge animal attack old hedge maze chase . or blood wall transforming redrum murder new vs . spine-tingling scene mirror where mother sees redrum backwards . or simply compare acting jobs uber-creepy old danny cute cuddly new danny . i know it not fair compare so i'll leave you this- if you want warm fuzzy fairy tale shining , go new . if you prefer horror , try kubrick version	-1

i just want say i really , really wanted like this movie ... i just couldn't bring myself . it came ifc other night since i've this independent film kick lately , it starred penn , morton thurman , i decided give it watch through . i heard good things it , mostly morton performance well penn , so i honestly say i high expectations . those expectations , sadly , not met . first all i want say penn performance so overrated i left appalled he even considered among spacey , crowe washington year . morton other hand add some weight picture proved she commanding actress even when she says not single word . penn plays fictional jazz guitarist emmett ray , very conceded irresponcible man who spent his time womanizing obsessing over better known musician djamgo reinhardt . film follows this mans life he takes up hattie ( morton ) mute woman who na�ve enough love this man then leaves her marry aspiring news reporter blanche ( thurman ) who using emmett story . much underused anthony lapaglia brad garrett make almost too-short cameos gangsters who get involved emmett blanche . all all this very slow moving film eventually went nowhere . woody allen known classic director , maybe case , but this nowhere near classic . it mockumentary style directing annoying since it not funny nor interesting , sean penn just plain ridiculous ( his character ) this over hyped film	-1

it when mass hanging scene stupidly inserted two , not just one , long church hymns , cardboard-like preacher gallows conduct crowd sing them , condemned-by-hanging rapist kept monologuing 10 minuntes synchronize those two hymns , this movie beginning fall flat miserably . other ridiculous illogic part when marshal escorted two young rustlers murderer back where hanging judge resided , why he suddenly take route across vast desert instead going back original path where posse came ? there no way no excuse make such stupid arrangement simply just because director screenplay writers wanted show how difficult tough marshal got heroic dead-man-walking mission , then turned himself out next lame a-hero-was-born scene . there wonderful moments this film , but it started drag lag behind gradually . it often gave you impression both screen writers director didn't clue how make this movie going , they could only asked clint eastwood , marshal , lot unnecessary hollow scenes .	-1

this review dvd released mgm 2002 . pride yankees story baseball hall famer lou gehrig . his nickname " iron horse " which he earned playing 2,130 consecutive games new york yankees mid 1920 late 1930 . major league record many years until cal ripken jr. broke it 1995 . course lou gehrig also remembered courageous man who died amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , sometimes also referred " lou gehrig disease " . movie stars gary cooper lou gehrig . movie gem essentially four facets it . one area lengthy coverage his relationship his domineering german mother ( played elsa janssen ) . second subplot courting marrying his wife ( played teresa wright ) . third subject lengthy coverage his great baseball career final facet film gehrig facing his mortality relatively early age . course these four areas overlap into each other throughout movie . personal viewpoint , i would liked seen lot more his baseball career less his love life . ( i'm sure this intentionally get women into theaters . ) movie sugarcoated squeaky clean very corny times , but personally i'd rather watch movie like this than films like babe ruth or ty cobb movies made 1990 where they exposed all dirty laundry their private lives . pride yankees classic , especially unforgettable " i consider myself luckiest guy face earth " speech yankee stadium . wonderful treat see babe ruth play himself movie there also few brief scenes yankee great : bill dickey . nice feature shots various american league ball barks gehrig played . it also great see some shots old grandstands yankee stadium before it renovated mid-`70s . overall , this movie whole family , 6 96 , enjoy . dvd picture quality outstanding . black white transfer impeccable . i don't recall seeing slightest flaw throughout entire movie sharpness excellent . sound fine too . dvd lacked bonus features which shame movie so highly acclaimed so many generations . there lot his baseball career wasn't covered movie , but could covered documentary sportswriters sports historians . movie itself some interesting stories regarding how it filmed . i once read article regarding how they filmed cooper playing gehrig . since cooper right handed gehrig left handed , they would film cooper running third base home instead home first after getting hit then reverse negative . movie : advd quality :	1
there few pictures which makes us experience feelings emotions mentally disturbed character such way , moment , we seem disturbed character . " shock corridor " journalist goes under cover mental patient into psychiatric ward but slowly descends into real madness . film tried but only succeeded partly - we hear journalists desperate thoughts voice-over it sounds more like radio play now then real thing . lodge kerrigan 1994 debut " clean , shaven " however , caused many moviegoers leave halfway picture because portrayal schizophrenic man so believable uncompromisingly hard lot people just couldn't bear it anymore . but because " clean , shaven " first place ment serious character study not so much entertainment ( fact : " clean , shaven " indeed very little entertaining values average audience ) it remained unjustifiably obscure little picture . but fortunately , people good sense what " real cinema " depicting " true not relenting emotions " still know there way these movies anyway . because still happens , every now then such movie gets made . gets through . ( note : same director struck back hard last year " keane " , movie schizophrenic man who suffers paranoia hallucnations which so effective we feel this disturbed man almost breeding down our necks . ) polanski film here , " repulsion " attempt putting viewer straight mind person that caught mental downward spiral . this attempt resulted picture gets grip viewer such way , fear , disgust paranoia becomes part them , almost much character herself . catherine deneuve young woman who feels best ( if she feels something positive all ) beauty parlour where she surrounded women ( collegue customers ) only . outside world she she withdrawn little girl shivers every touch man ( it accidental or purpously ) . her blank , empty eyes show no emotions only when she scared even then deneuve keeps dead-pan face most time . because she doesn't open up her thoughts emotons viewer ( like journalist " shock corridor " ) we not know where her repulsion fears come or ... where they go . but polanski keeps camera pretty much her face anyhow we go her , stroling through streets london or dwelling her sisters appartment . we not so much voyeurs but more witnesess something or somebody we rather not witness . but like lodge kerrigan , polanski master manipulating menages keep hard core movie fans intrigued . his lowbudget-like approach , fully use claustrophobic surroundings pretty much literaly speak themselves ( desolate sounds dripping water , neuroticly ticking clocks , creepy cracking shelves , echoes slamming doors - completely effective realistic way , wich he would repeated often , like " tenant " course " rosemary baby " ) pays off . polanski more then just exceptional filmmaker - he visionair . halfway through movie , there no more reason argue : this cannot happy end ! but going down spiral made here rarely seen form art , which sounds , shots , plays light shadows , totally convincing actress , stretched limits - sometimes boldly go beyond . it not fun witness deneuve falling apart , but it every real movie lover witness this film . it hard , harsh , rough , daring . therefor all more admired .	1

i saw " atomic cafe " when it first came out 1982 , film lost none its zip intervening years . film montage military civilian footage americans attempting deal destructive enormity atomic power , overlain cheesiest a-bomb related period music . starting interview unapologetic paul tibbetts ( who flew enola gay its bombing run over hiroshima ) through nixon-khrushchev " kitchen debates " 1950s , film takes us wild irreverent ride through america terrified prospect instant annihilation . what neat movie not narrated except voices times . president eisenhower urges america ( its consumer greatness ) not panic . bert turtle teaches generation children duck cover when they see atomic flash . government films urge country into fallout shelters where they wait few minutes before coming up take look around start arduous job straightening picture frames knocked askew blast . catholic clergy filmed dispensing government build bomb permitting homeowners stock " protective devices " their shelters against those poor souls trying get . torrent disinformation misinformation fascinating , would funnier if possibility nuclear war not so real . ironic too population level trust government clearly unwilling level it level destruction bomb would perpetrate . film mis-stepped only once , allowing sympathy rosenbergs . subsequent years shown they most probably give nuclear secrets soviets . i feel pity their children abhor their executions without excusing their wickedness . " atomic cafe " agenda . juxtaposing pictures children hiding under beds school desks images obliteration bombed test homes , it makes clear fact nuclear war not mostly-survivable thing might lead some complacency atomic attack . film not stint showing horrors nuclear attack fallout . such , it great service laying out true cost atomic warfare well blindly trusting those who control detonation those awful weapons . dvd extras nothing special -- little more than trailers credits	1

seriously , i didn't even think this comedy until i came here saw people saying " it wasn't funny . " i got it part boxed set cary grant films ( purchased here ) , it only dud lo t.t here one scene , i grant you , light entertaining . not laugh out loud , but funny enough ( i won't spoil it saying which one ) . aside , film struck me rather unbelievable farce infidelity . most all , you could almost feel very talented cast trying keep this elephant airborne . grant simmons , particular , strong - but their efforts ultimately squandered . bob mitchum ok , but generally miscast , kerr beauty talent basically wasted . no amount acting would allow you believe anyone could act impetuously stupidly she here . she goes happily married tramp 5 minutes , no discernible reason . overall acting : ( grant/simmons : b)directing : fwriting : d-i understand this film caters more english tastes , that fine , but i found it most un-satisfying	-1

like many other reviewers , i went into movie thinking it would horrors war . but it much more than . it story prejudices how they exacerbate already terrible situations . it remarkable see interactions chechens their russian prisoner . human level , they so similar . life , they could friends . but moment , they enemies , no matter how comfortable each acting , you could tell they never forgot . movie started out very slow , but toward middle it started pick up . there some very funny moments . i'm not sure they supposed funny , but i good laugh . overall , not bad movie , but not everybody .	-1

garbo her first talkie marvelous this adaptation eugene o'neills pulitzer winning play , whore trying reform . marie dressler brilliant supporting performance washed-out drunk , everyone else letter-perfect . now caveat : technical shortcomings early talkies replete here , so you should stay away if stuff like what concerns you . added attraction , dvd also includes simultaneously filmed german language version movie different ( save garbo , course ) cast : quite bit darker , tho not ( me ) accessible . course one never forget magic hearing gg utter : " gif me visky , ginger ale side , don ' stingy , baby .	-1
both big fan this movie film student , i feel critics quick judge this film bad trash . this film sexy edge it , many other films " teen film " genre dare exhibit . new best friend fullfills fantasy those girls who secretly desire live dangerously party every night , without it actually becoming reality . house every girl dream , these girls alluring suavely tempting . acting far terrible , it great see meredith monroe more sophisticated darker role than her role andie dawson creek . dominique swain once again puts a+ effort her role cheeky deviant sydney . anyone who loved films like tart cruel intentions , this film you .	1

i watch this once year never get tired it . hepburn tracy great together usual . company setting appealing , makes me yearn pre-pc days when big companies bars , christmas parties drinking revelry , etc . it christmas movie out ordinary . my favorite scene when it raining tracy goes home hepburn . they all cozy fire fried chicken floating island , only walked upon wonderfully arrogant gig young . sometimes i just watch this scene alone ! i also love line near end movie where young says he thinking hepburn asks him what like . delight	1

this movie lives up it horrible reviews ! it not really bad enough called " so bad it good " not good enough considered good movie . yeah , it bad but it not cool or funny type bad . script based book though lots people claim book great if it anything like movie i probably won't read it ! story totally cliche unoriginal : earth ruins taken over aliens group humans must save themselves extinction , slavery etc , etc . dialogue weird , pace movie weird ending very predictable . combine bad story , lousy acting , bad costumes , low quality special effects bad camera work you this cheese-fest movie . travolta bad guy this movie it really easy hate him , perhaps little too easy ! he calls humans " rat brain " but i think word better suited him ! travolta really bloated face i don't think it costume or makeup . what ever happened getting shape role ? he average actor this character nothing bring out his good qualities . plus side there lot shooting explosions movie so if you're into you might like this movie . i thought it stinker not watch it again !	-1
woody allen great filmmaker who made some comedies also deep character studies ( annie hall , manhattan , hannah her sisters , etc . ) . however , there something said films like what up , tiger lily , play it again , sam sleeper -- films just plain funny . probably best these take money run which spoofs true crime documentaries time . allen plays virgil starkwell , hilariously inept career criminal whose life one misadventure after . using " testimony " people starkwell life cinema vierte style photography , allen peppers audience hilarious sight gag after sight gag . among my favorites : 1 . high school , starkwell joins marching band ... cello player . image allen running up street chair cello hand , stopping moment play few bars , then getting up running few more feet hysterically funny . 2 . starkwell invites his girlfriend ( played janet margolin " david lisa " ) dinner but doesn't money . he breaks into several parking meters . when he tips maitre'd , he dumps several dollars change into his hand all over floor . 3 . starkwell robs bank , but teller can't read note he hands him , thinking word " gun " " gub . " 4 . when entering prison , one guards frisks starkwell , inducing peals ticklish laughter . indeed , take money run seems lot more like film allen former colleague your show shows , mel brooks , than like one his later films . story just framework gag after gag -- most which unbelievably funny . allen some wonderful deep character studies later his career , but take money run hilarious comedy should stand among his best work	1
what it middle aged professors anyway ? [8-d ] i same kind thoughts reactions this professor , but they remained fantasies . it took me one day teaching , i discovered how vulnerable these young women . ( my race didnt matter either ) , they just feel so indebted ( guilt something ? ) us our passion teaching them . me its natural thing , them it gift them . definitely such thing mid-life trauma or crisis . i would wanted this girl movie too , because real crisis like this often breaks outside social contructs ; hence trauma or crisis . americans truely spoiled their myopic view what men want what beauty , it matters this particular situation . i must admit i struggling some my own inadequacies also , which heightened this age . funny how even achieving ones ' dreams cannot fully engage total personhood . we must careful not get sideswiped what we think " success " . achieving ones goal not time see " success " ( its journey not destination-remember saying ? )and then let your guard down . suggestion : human effort but not without humility through spiritual connection you see greater than yourself ! it become practice-not magic trick , but it helps me balance things . ps . men often avoid " attractive " ones because they hide their insecurities , but young girl who needs someone think she attractive ... older male tells her she ... well , it happens .... lot .	-1

what could your average slasher flick particularly amateur cast , held together wit , charm , charisma jamie lee curtis . familiar face leslie nielson ( one his last dramatic roles before his transition comedy ) doesn't hurt either . this canadian-made horror , its glazed cinematography used good effect , tells story childhood accident comes back haunt surviving group friends nearly 10 years later their senior prom . while film not altogether original ( many elements previous horror films all-to o-o bvious here ) , it nonetheless enjoyable slasher flick entertainment . decent performances make this nice effort	-1

i've owned laserdisc this 1981 performance many years . i've tranferred it dvd so i could view it conveniently dvd changer because i'd lost hope it would ever appear commercially dvd . production brilliant great " victorian " touches ( terms time period they seem come ) act ii ; mechanical " contraptions " wonderful . production fantastic , it should , yet seems rooted late 1800 . it also rich , sensual royal opera production . young domingo baltsa their best . regarding other dvds opera : much one vaguely admire opera de lyon " some tales hoffman " , striving different ( very stark ) destroys opera me . 1978 paris opera production ok if rather provincial looking ( very simple sets ) . 1970 komische oper berlin production actually quite good lively , but it sung german . even if musical performances royal opera production only ok it would winner , but performances excellent . anyone who thinks they even little interest french opera should buy this	1

this jazz-fan delight : tons jazz , featuring tenor saxophone some bebop thrown . most music nice mellow stuff interesting hear , even non-jazz buff like me . music interesting story made me purchase dvd , which i subsequently watched few couple times . story pretty laid-back , simple tale american alcoholic sax great playing france who reforms because french fan who cares him . dexter gordon unique voice makes helps him become interesting character hear real-life jazz great proves decent actor , too . francois cluzet plays admirer who goes out his way help his idol . gabrielle haker pleasant watch cluzet young daughter . she always seems pleasant smile her face . i don't why this film rated " " because there no sex , no nudity , little profanity except several " mf , " which must reason rating . nevertheless , it pretty tame movie . even though story bit slow would probably bore heck out most young people today , i found it entertaining definitely different . it just nice , gentle story , whether you fan jazz or not .	-1
after watching fabulous bonus features this dvd ( biography william ' wild bill ' wellman observations robert mitchum tab hunter , bio " track " author walter van tilburg clark , look actual mountain lions their habitat , more ) , i realized i held ' minority opinion ' film , itself , compared many reviewers you'll read , here ; i think it stagy , lacks sense dread palpable suspense novel , doesn't ' hold up ' well most director work . tale dysfunctional family it boiling point , impact nearly primordial panther , changing their lives , characters , exception always watchable robert mitchum , domineering middle son , all either boring , frustratingly indecisive , or downright unlikable . oldest son william hopper , best-known ' paul drake ' television " perry mason " , dreamer , who ' bonds ' environment , but lacks instinctive power defeat cat , never comes across more than wishy-washy ; bitter spinster sister teresa wright offers one-note portrayal soon becomes grating ; youngest son tab hunter so wimpy you quickly lose interest him ; philip tonge , loquacious alcoholic father , whose drinking problem , novel , tragic , here becomes stereotyped comic drunk , hidden bottles liquor providing ' comic relief ' ; diana lynn , hunter girl , tries hard , but never seems more than minor character proceedings ; even legendary beulah bondi , greedy , bible-spouting , mean-spirited mother , seems simply channel her ' bad mom ' portrayal " what if ? " sequence " it wonderful life " . worst all , ex-little rascal carl ' alfalfa ' switzer , encased phony-looking ' old age ' make-up ' pass ' 100-year-old ranch hand/medicine man , looks neither believable , or comfortable role . farm set looks patently artificial ( obviously sound stage ) , outdoor scenes , shot mount rainier , must take up slack ; sadly , despite creativity using high contrasts make colors achieve ' black white ' look , book greatest asset , constant , frightening ' unseen ' presence malevolent cat , me , never achieved , despite mitchum monologue he gradually succumbs helpless fear ; fact , hunter final confrontation cat handled so ' routinely ' you can't understand what all fuss ! film big letdown !	-1

titan ae really good scifi movie . it fantastic visuals , chases , good enough story keep you interested . voice acting also pretty good . unfortunately movie suffers what many movies , especially this genre , suffer . they don't commit adult or child-based audience , nor go after strictly scifi audience or more general audience . so what ends up happening you get just enough both , without fully focusing one target audience , kind sterile , but still good . if you looking mind blowing concepts something other than ' standard scifi fare ' this isn't where look . if you want good movie keeps you entertained kids watch too , this great flick .	-1
most reviews this film appear written males , so i thought i would add female point view discussion . i bought dvd my husband valentine day , he fan western genre , watched it him . it not exactly romantic valentine day fare . here few short observations : my opinion , film should rated " , " instead " pg , " because its violent scenes . there no good guys this film , only flawed characters . i found marlon brando character , amoral regulator , blood-chillingly evil . compared him , bumbling rustlers seem almost sympathetic characters . i very nearly found myself rooting " bad " guys . this not your typical , old-fashioned western . it more-interesting film more-believable characters .	-1

if you're looking schlocky horror movie lots excess gore , some gratuitous nudity , mad scientist , reanimated body carrying its head around it , then this movie you . re-animator one those films you hear horror fan , after watching it it very clear why . reanimator epitome tongue-in-cheek horror . without ever cracking joke , film exudes campiness bit sadistic humor . when herbert west arrives medical school answers medical student dan cain request roommate , fast paced story takes big leap . all characters bit out there . dr. hill , evil professor " thing " uptight dean daughter , who cain happens engaged , sets out steal research west worked . research resulted glowing green substance brings dead tissue back life . re-animator stays exciting entire time , story never lets up . final climactic showdown med students ( west cain ) re-animated headless dr. hill stuff horror legend . don't miss it .	-1
i really liked this film . it not groundbreaking movie any way , though . it bunch underdog kids who aren't interested football until coach comes changes their minds . throughout movie we see kids working out trying hard prepare match against other more talented ( unlikeable ) team . it pretty much same thing we've seen mighty ducks except now it football . it just typical family movie sends message children even if you're small think you don't any talent , you actually talent play football , hockey , basketball , whatever . one characters girl who doesn't know if she wants play football boys or cheerleader like all other girls . rick moranis once again plays shy , quiet character he so well other films such honey i shrunk kids . it hard believe he now country singer ( no , i'm not kidding ) . ed o'neil doesn't quite play jerk character you'd expect married children show . he not really nice guy either , though . i find it interesting team names giants ( good guys ) vs . cowboys ( bad guys ) because monday night football game this week those two teams facing each other ( giants winning )	1

i remember seeing my life when it came out ten years ago thinking it wonderful film . when i purchased it recently dvd film itself lost none its poignancy . plot film relatively few twists turns . beginning film bob jones ( played michael keaton ) diagnosed terminal cancer . jones wife , gail ( nicole kidman ) pregnant their first child , so bob decides start filming series videotapes shown son he knows he unlikely ever see . gail eventually also gets bob visit chinese healer ( hiang ngor ) , who apparently using mix traditional remedies psychology help bob . this point where film could gotten extremely corny , but director bruce joel rubin not overdo mysticism avoids taking easy way out bob make sudden dramatic recovery . healer essentially just vehicle move us into bob personal history conflicts his siblings brother extremely well . this superbly acted film . this film stars nichole kidman before she made nichole kidman films very versitile michael keaton , who coming off batman series . their strong performances buttressed supporting roles bradley whitford ( west wing ) , queen latifah ( chicago ) , michael constantine ( my big fat greek wedding ) , richard schiff ( west wing ) rebecca schull ( wings ) . it extremely deep cas t.t his emotional film , end day , someone cancer , so prepared crying end . however , instead two hours tension , film crafted so after particularly dramatic sequence you section includes some humor , mostly involving bob guidance his son . because end , when it comes , not totally unexpected , you don't finish film feeling drained ; instead , ultimate message behind plot one hope redemption . overall , film excellent if you like drama - if you looking popcorn film , this may not you . sadly , there very few extras dvd . however , if you want see well-acted , well-written , well-acted mostly serious film , you far worse than my life	-1

this series just tad too much blood my taste ... it verges horror , here there , which bugs me ; i even like super-violent action movies just fine , but brutally slaughtered recent corpse thing ( more ' personalized ' violence than killing bad guys ) not my style . this why i gave it 4 instead 5 stars . aside detail , i find this show totally addictive . brothers make ' buddy movie ' effect , whole supernatural framework creates sort non-religious yet definitely spiritual effect ( big mystery why these guys never ever seen praying show ; i actually known people who lifestyle similar what show depicts , central ) . not mention young men so passionate , powerful , strong , yet sensitive , darkly troubled past , sheer sexy it nearly intoxicating over long run many episodes . ;-) anyway -- show actual plot , it well filmed intelligently well worth watching . i recommend it	-1
woody allen plays himself , but transported russia time napoleonic invasion this delightfully side-splitting send-up both war peace begman pretentious , death-obsessed films . allen directs stars , co-star diane keaton his bizzare self-obsessed cousin/love interest excellent support cast includes harold gould ( sting , feather father ) wonderful georges ade t.t he bouyant soundtrack , based largely prokofiev lt . kije suite , real plus , on-location shots hungary stand fairly well russia . anyone who suffered through nightmarishly dull henry fonda version ' war peace ' ready this . even if you haven't seen it , you're probably ready dianne keaton marriage herring merchant or her assertion god exists , make woody his image , equally wears glasses , albeit " not those frames .

last starfighter nice little sci-fi action movie which revolutionary when it released due it use early version cgi-effects . 1984 special-effects quite new showed just what possible years come . movie itself fun simple sci-fi actioner which owes alot arcade shooters which popular during 80 . even main plotline film pretty much video game sent benevolent space-faring star league looking find few good starfighters save their federation danger zur kodan armada . lance guest plays alex rogan whose only pas t-t ime trailer-park where he lives his mother younger brother his girlfriend maggie gordon ( played 80 genre favorite catherine mary stewart ) constantly playing video game called last starfighter . alex expert skills beating game brings new wrinkle his hum-drum life which seems going nowhere . seeming con-man salesman name centauri ( played gusto energy robert preston ) comes out nowhere gives him offer opportunity out this world . rest film brings alex reluctance join star league starfighter pilot gunstar fighter . he thinks its all mistake he wasn't signing up some sort intergalactic war may just kill him . like most action movies alex epiphany what his role destiny must , some reluctance , finally takes challenge controls goes off fight zur kodan armada his lone gunstar his trusty navigator all-around lizardman mentor , grigg ( played equal parts seriousness fun dan o'herlihy ) . those like me who grew up during 80 enjoyed watching these simple but fun sci-fi movies last starfighter quite blast past which still delights entertains despite corny dialogue cheesy effects . cgi-effects gunstar kodan armada looks dated but i still can't take my eyes off screen whenever these early looking cg effects come . acting pretty standard b-movie quality everyone seeming fun premise giving it their all . there nothing write academy but end performances just enough make audience like characters . last starfighter quite underrated scifi action movie which should've better than it when it first came out . it since gained cult following video always welcome sight whenever it comes cable . movie may seem dated compared super advanced cgi-effects laden blockbusters we now but it still entertains people who grew up watching it kids who grown up since	-1

you like cop movies ? if you then you're luck . alien nation essentially cop movie ... aliens . fact it just cop movie aliens what makes this movie little groundbreaking . however like any other genre movies , this cop movie isn't perfect . it falls into some same trappings most cop movies . spite alien nation innovative science fiction genre , even if innovation itself played out nausea elsewhere . this isn't high cop drama like black rain or heat . it isn't necessarily low cop drama either like v.i. warshowski or rookie . cop drama part pretty much middle . so what makes it innovative ? well ... it aliens . one things make really good science fiction when aspects real life get represented fashion . films like aliens their viet nam war contrast , contact its spiritual belief contrast , their holocaust similarities all stand out above crowd because they compare their situations real issues . alien nation same . not buddy cop themes but themes racial hatred discrimination . instead some other ethnic minority you get alien refugees planet . you get all parallels bigotry modern society this film , they address it concise manner . said it still cop movie overall . oddly matched police officers learning accept each other , drug lord looking take over , lots gunplay cop jokes ... they all end up here . this aspect movie merely average . just like all other cop movies you seen over decades . cinematography , settings , script , style all fall victims cop movie theme they all nothing really write home when compared other police films . this doesn't mean script , cinematography other stuff i mentioned bad . it just doesn't stand out above crowd . appreciate alien nation what it : parallel society discrimination against people different than us . understand fact vehicle they used portray this , it appropriate one , clich�d cop plot . if you like cop movies sci-fi then you found winner here . rest you i won't say it overall great movie , but i say it pretty good one .	-1

comparisons 1937 classic inevitable . story-wise , there little difference except colonization remake . many frames carbon copies each other . this reviewer feels bamp ; format original added suspense . original cast clearly superior especially male leads ronald coleman , david niven . aubrey smith . also , douglas fairbanks jr. outshines james mason rupert hentzau , main bad guy . ( i wonder if stunt man performed high dive . ) nice gesture cameo role lewis stone , star 1922 silent version . it 1952 female leads who compare most favorably : deborah kerr comes very close equaling madeleine carroll lovely queen flavia , her strong (!) sense duty . jane greer probably surpasses mary astor 1937 role . both mary jane key plot . watch them closely ! blessedly , despite many frame similarities , remake not carbon copy 1937 fadeout , ronald coleman gallant wave farewell . its ' own merits , 1952 version very credible adventure story indeed . it only suffers comparison original classic it cannot possibly surpass	-1

i'm often shocked how far afield i seem drifted my fellow man ( or woman ) , but reviews netflix here tear this remarkable piece work shreds just baffling . but when i think it all context my own love appreciation this film how much it reminds me listening really raw , emotional improvisational jazz ( which even i right mood ) it occurs me this just acquired taste , like any expression creativity . all art subjective , i found this kind visual interpretation series fascinating moments stories me completely spellbound . i rented this ( which i ordered next day so i watch it over over again ) popped it late one night before bed , intending only watch few minutes but i could not bring myself stop watched entire thing . all i could say afterwards " wow " . this not conventional storytelling standard story arcs or any discernable traditional flow , that exactly why i love it ! see something really unique , spontaneous , rich , unpredictable almost voyeuristic so refreshing . i honestly didn't know ethan hawke directed this until credits rolling , judging reviews i've seen this film his books , he evokes either great loyalty recognition people or pushes buttons result scathing comments . interesting . i think it good thing . we enough cute fuzzy filmmakers out there . i love how contraints situation forced everyone more creative present because comes through loud clear . scenes kristofferson weld stunning . absolutely stunning . all actors fantastic . film random , beautiful , confusing , interesting poetic without preachy . i'd love see more films like this , but now i'll happy my dvd sharing it kindred spirits . beautiful work everyone involved . thank you	1
( i not read play nor seen it performed stage so i didn't miss features other reviewers mentioned . ) i found this thoroughly enjorable . rupert everett perfectly embodies paradoxical virtues oscar wilde ... self admitted scoundral who only speaks seriously tuesdays 1 3 . his total opposite gertrude ( blanchett ) , married her ideal husband , man she placed formidably high pedestal virtue . naturally , fall scoundral saves day . ( knowing what we wilde life we appreciate this theme even more . ) underneath his protestations superficiality he emerges real hero . that theme -- no one perfect it takes more courage love imperfect person than perfect one . but wilde doesn't bludgeon us over head message --- he delights us brilliant dialogue clever plot . if there no moral all , it would still delight watch . acting all very good . rupert everett , everyone mentioned , seems born play wilde . i disagree those who said there no chemistry him minnie driver character . i thought their scenes together most entertaining film . she genuinely funny well very beautiful . blanchett perfect her role pale , virtuous-to-boredom wife . i thought only weak link julianne moore , who seemed miscast villianess . perhaps i've seen her too many " realistic " american roles which she such depth humanity vulnerability i hard time adjusting this julianne . i thought her accent lacking she just didn't arch quality such part demanded . however she carried it off well enough not spoil enjoyment film . it definitely fun worth seeing	1

disappointing stephen king miniseries . some reason , lately i've rewatching some older stephen king miniseries i hadn't seen since they originally aired . maybe i thought they'd better without all commercials drag them . cream crop stand . dregs langoliers , worst special effects ever ... ed wood would proud . tommyknockers falls somewhere . basically it tells story how one lady ( marg helgenberger ) stumbles across mysterious little object woods , compelled unearth it . turns out its some sort alien craft power exert its " " people little maine town nearby . these people undergo gradual ( or not so gradual ) personality changes which allows them " suddenly " invent impossible machines , read each others minds , also gleefully kill anyone who seeks thwart them . that all well good . sounds like it could good , clean , gory fun . certainly , book it based . i know king himself not terribly fond book , mostly because he wrote it during height his drug alcohol additions ... but it contained some his most disturbing scenes too , believable , ultimately heartbreaking romance two leads . i always liked it myself . ( me , king nadir dark half . ) back " movie . " jimmy smits plays helgenberger boyfriend , formerly successful poet now awash alcoholism ... but trying climb out his hole . he immune power tommyknockers because steel plate his head , but goes ride much story because guilt he feels over his own behavior . eventually , things get bad enough he finally musters up courage take matters into his own hands ... rather serious consequences himself . but story told plodding manner . every compelling scene ( example , early smits reception where he drinking too much , gloriously over-the-top embarrassing moment ) there two clunkers ( cliff de young traci lords two postal employees undergoing some serious hanky-panky sorting room !! ) helgenberger smits fine , joanna cassidy local sheriff e.g. marshall kindly curmudgeon . but lengthy novel condensed so awkwardly , subplot deyoung lords given far , far too much time screen ( de young one worst actors ever get more than one role ) keep make even gamest performances worthwhile . i guess producers so tickled former porn star lords their set , they just couldn't help coming up more ridiculous things her . also , we forced see how far robert carradine ( so good " head nerd " revenge nerds all those years ago ) fallen ... he turns perfectly dreadful performance . special effects makeup quite cheesy . but many things could forgiven decent adaptation managed . but tommyknockers doomed start pitiful script , not helped uninspired direction . if you're big fan smits , cassidy or helgenberger , i guess you might want take gander . if you're fan stephen king or horror/sci-fi ... stay away !	-1
" cleopatra " got great deal noteriety when it production because romance developed elizabeth taylor richard burton . their romance got more publicity than this movie historical romance they reinacted . i guess soured me movie i never took opportunity watch it until this last weekend . i must say first half " cleopatra " quite impressive but largely due outstanding performance rex harrison julius ceasar . there added help seemingly limitless budget lot attention detail . everything settings costumes elaborate say least . addition , elizabeth taylor probably never quite so alluringly beautiful . after intermission , death julius ceasar brings mark anthony , played richard burton , leading male role . burton excellent actor but he no rex harrison ; least not " cleopatra " . part undoubtably due " tragic " character he plays comparison than " bigger-than-life " character ceasar . so it , but it bit overdone . mark anthony constantly drink his hand harder believe than richard burton constantly drink his hand . may part problem burton apparent failure mark anthony ; he may too good washed-up man . last half movie just seemed drag . it could easily cut hour length result better movie . i give it four stars based harrison talent , taylor looks 20th century fox extravagance .	-1
dead again slipped into theaters kenneth branagh while he emma thompson married working very well together . film mystery several levels : 1940s murder mystery , present day identity search , even whether reincarnation happens . branagh blended black white flashbacks modern day action seemlessly . plots twists superb , yet quiet . entire movie gives you time think what happening form your own conclusion what happen ; yet you find your conclusion wrong . although mysteries usually lose something after first viewing , when you find out how it ends , dead again actually gains . once you know how it ends , you want watch it again again look subtle clues missed first time through even try find mistakes , although i warn you , i seen it least 20 times still not found any mistakes	1

why this not success box office ? what marvelous , intelligent , thoughtful , character-driven , sweet , movie ! how great it see jennifer lopez , not cover magazine , just cutting through all nonsense some excellent , meat potatoes acting ! i'm only not giving movie 5 stars because i some problems very end movie -- i won't say what happens but i would preferred something bit more subtle . said , it still wonderful movie . they don't make many movies like this these days . rent or buy it -- it great stuff	-1

any film starts visual version " it dark stormy night " might otherwise regarded suspicion but not hands director james whale . it worth checking out ? absolutely this one whale masterpieces using humor , some creepy imagery great cast ( boris karloff , melvyn douglas , raymond massey , gloria stuart , charles laughton , ernest thesinger other notable stage vets ) create moody chiller humor . extras include thoughtful trivia filled commentary gloria stuart second commentary whale bigorapher film historian james curtis . curtis harrington provides detailed introduction how he became involved saving film , meeting whale , etc . video quality this portion so-so . transfer film looks solid although it could use more digital cleaning up ( like recently reissued editions " frankenstein " " dracula " ) . although film appears bit unsteady beginning , it improves . i personally thought contrast could improved bit well . audio sounds good but volume bit low probably could stand bit cleaning up get rid some hiss popping . follow up whale his star boris karloff " frankenstein " , this witty , cynical horror film well adapted writer ben levy . thought lost years ( original film out circulation least 44 years when william castle made his weak remake ) , director curtis harrington found copy film which this version drawn . film almost lost when universal sold rights columbia 1963 . luckily director curtis harrington ( who befriended director whale late life)while working universal asked negative pulled duplicated . otherwise film would lost firs reel this classic pretty bad shape . overall this pretty good reissue classic whale film out circulation too long . it classic right up there whale " waterloo bridge " , " bride frankenstein " , invisible man " " frankenstein " although closer tone " bride " " invisible " than his straight horror films .	1

so your wife dumped you , you carried grudge so deep so strong come up scheme frame her up murdering you sentenced life prison . well , some people would say this revenge sweet , but i don't think so . i think it too much too crazily cruel , because wife didn't really betray him , she didn't affair other man committed adultery . she just getting tired marriage fairly knew only through legal system she could dump her husband successfully . this very vicious screenplay extreme only purpose warn people soured marriage get divorced more reasonable friendly way , always leave some room yourself other .	-1

80 spawned one high school teen movie after , john hughes king genre . but somehow way among breakfast clubs pretty pinks , three o'clock high got overlooked . it quite rare when i actually meet someone who heard this comedy gem . i quite lot trouble even finding copy it dvd going purchase copy here amazon , but finally found it buy/sell/trade store hollywood . so anyway , while i am very happy finally this movie dvd widescreen first time , instead watching it my vcr recorded scratchy tape , i little dissapointed there no features whatsoever this disc ( movie reccomendations don't count , you get plenty those amazon ) . further proof not enough people know or care this movie . furthermore , casey siemaszko , star , heart soul this movie , failed develop lead actor since this movie never really got any recognition , ( he lot supporting roles late 80s such young guns , stand me back future ) which shame because he too funny this movie . movie good cast too , even though protagonist film who looks 15 years too old high school , he perfect school bully . not mention this movie best school yard fight you'll ever see . please , check this one out . john hughes isn't only one who could make good 80 highschool movies this certainly one best ones	1
( 3.5 /5 stars ) it amazing how many words phrases this film become normalized part vernacular . " awesome " one obvious example , it difficult imagine teenagers today conversing without use " like , " where it not used connote " similarity . " time its release , these rather novel . this film good soundtrack it pretty decent love story popular , middle class girl , who falls boy wrong side tracks . title role , deborah foreman quite irresistible . nicolas cage fine rough-hewn randy , though he never very believable favorite son his tough neighborhood . it embarrassing point laughter he interacts his homeboys during cruise through his neighborhood . aspect not ring true some dialogue . prime example this conversation among randy , julie , tommy stacie club hollywood , where they sit down immediately begin discussing their statuses degrees authenticity . not only it not convincing its content , transition it non-existent . gripes aside , this not bad film . however , i would not go so far say it great either . comedy , it isn't very funny . romance , their love seems based physical attributes rather than commonalities , such , not very compelling . nonetheless , elizabeth daily always delight , her role here makes this must fans . also , dvd transfer , 5.1 channel mix effort both widescreen full screen versions worth extra � star .	-1
this movie made me laughing until i cried . its really great movie . cast excellent job , especially bob saget . he awesome sooo funny	1
most those who lucky enough see this stunning srdjan dragojevic film select film festivals u.s. not forgotten its clarity , its anger , its power . movie passed up theatrical distribution , although it readily available vhs now dvd fox lorber . this dvd bust every thinkable way , although fox lorber obviously aiming very low . phrase " bare-bones " usually used describe discs given rudimentary , dismissive releases , lacking supplements more presumably marketable titles might warrant . this dvd contain trailer , but trailer , sadly , looks better than feature . " bare-bones " would fine , but watching this disc torture . it obviously quickie transfer vhs -- i could produced better amateur transfer -- loud hiss tainting soundtrack throughout , poor audio balance ( dialogue pulsing speakers artificial echo ) poor contrast , muddy , dark image , burnt-in subtitles , so forth . fox lorber long scourge art-film dvd market , their soulless neglect their titles never more apparent than this disc . new yorker wellspring ( formerly winstar ) guilty similar offenses	-1

i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1
i loved this movie since it came out . its even better directors cut , there quite few scenes not original	1
' friday foster ' grier getting even closer ' cleopatra jones ' territory , but without fun style movie or its sequel . i slightly disappointed when i saw it because it didn't deliver typical kick ** madness you normally get pam grier movie ! storyline tame , forced political correctness only pesky whole stuff lacks violence sex , so prepare blaxploitation its mildest form ! here we pam grier , friday- magazine photographer , who given assignment covering airport arrival richest black man america . but friday gets more than she bargained this routine assignment turns into assassination attempt . because friday able get some shots would killers , her life danger . soon , everywhere she goes , people end up dead . friday investigations lead her corrupt government officials , renowned preacher eye more than bible , something called black widow . pam grier convincing lead , but not tough " coffy " or " foxy brown " ! this movie actually one best supporting casts any blaxploitation film , but fails hold up its end . if you want entertained somehow watch out performances genre greats like yaphet kotto plays grier detective buddy , julius harris her boss . plus there scatman crothers (' black belt jones ' ) , thalmus rasulala (' blacula ' ) , godfrey cambridge (' cotton comes harlem ' ) , paul benjamin (' across 110th street ' ) carl weathers (' rocky ' ) , well eartha kitt who hoot flamboyant fashion designer , isaac bartender ' love boat ' ( ted lange ) even inexplicably ' gilligan island thurston howell iii ( jim backus) ! this film some lighthearted tone comparison her other films . that not say there aren't plenty killings , but it never feels depressing , downbeat , or serious something like " coffy . " it nice change pace see grier laughing joking kotto many film scenes . action scenes good funny same time . one my personal favorites rooftop chase kotto weathers second fashion show . fashion line up just crazy because models showed no form expression going down runway while doing form vogue-dance sort scared me bit while maintaining zombie like expression across their face , you see it order understand it . i'm fan 70s blaxplotation because it reminds me my parents era fashion sense , gotta love them . i stated before " friday foster " may not spectacular film but it still welcome my movie collection .	-1
i heard it said norman maclean classic novella " river runs through it " finest piece american literature ever written . i don't understand how things like literature ranked such simple terms . i say , however , it one my personal favorites . spare , poetic spellbinding . perhaps one reasons i love this novella so because i grew up farm near rocky mountains , spent so much time when i younger fishing tracking through wood field . maclean tale speaks me my youth authentic familiar terms . i generally approach cinematic adaptations literature , particularly literature which i hold such high esteem , certain amount reluctance , even dread . who could possibly capture beautiful , simple craftmanship maclean profound prose celluloid ? evidently , robert redford . he it grace apparent ease . many maclean efficeintly magnificent words provided through narration . while i generally find device voiceover narration distasteful ( primarily because it so often used " coach " viewer ) , this case , viewer drawn into ( eased out ) macleans world macleans own prose , nothing could more appropriate or satisfying . also , cinematography nothing short spectacular , capturing magnificent , rugged expanse montana " big sky " wilderness one moment , golden intimacy afternoon river next . i dare say redford captured essence maclean abiding love his childhood wilderness this film , we , viewers , richer it . river runs through it close perfection i seen translating beloved work letters onto cinematic screen . it its flaws ? i'm sure it , there other reviews here point them out you if you care . my part , i wish only say this story love , crafted maclean love , now adapted screen redford care speaks love - love subject matter written words . macleans last words novella ( movie ) " i am haunted waters . " thanks his words , redfords faithful adaptation them , i too am haunted	1

certainly novel georges bernanos entitled journal d'un cure de campagne created its alarm its day it exposed some less spiritual more secular realities society , yet it deeply insightful still troubling examination young priest struggling live spiritual authenticity his difficult vocation diocesan priest strange cold town while slowly dying stomach cancer . fortunately bernanos portrays this priest gifted careful writer who maintains intimate diary . therefore this novel , old style liaisons dangerueses , presents its narrative guise discovered records now published . it therefore impossible film . yet bresson so admirably faithfully sincerely , great talent , technique wisdom . thankfully great criterion offers us wonderful reprint restored very recently which we may view again again this wonderful , subtle , moving film . my only choking point course subtitles which go invisible against white background appear so intrusively against black background young asthetic priest pre-vatican cassock , but then french most part spoken so slowly carefully we follow original practice , which always best any case . it also accompanied priest clearly chronicling his journal words we hear repeated , we watch him write across big screen , thus this film start graciously supplies its own subtitles original . one great advanatge this criterion edition brilliant commentary . once this helpful , unlike example ubiquitous mr. carpenter similar overdubbed commentaries , where speaker mumbles like someone who believes they know much actually parrot inanities which make you want reach forward cinema seat before you shyly demand their silence . here optional commentary said before brilliant , helpful , gracious , utterly informative thought provoking , including when nephew count speaks his fleeing foreign legion commentator draws parallel explicitly current rush war iraq grotesquely heretical hymn " onward , christian soldiers ! " every catholic should see this film remember life before second vatican council , time two wars , loneliness our parish priets their spiritual struggle quasi-hermits wilderness . it delight see old vestments , kissed embrodiered cross , hear latin blessing proper gestures . it interesting see villagers presuming our contemporary infamous evil priest regard little girls he prepares first holy communion . commentator again provides useful information regarding actor preparation this role . yet any commentary no matter how excellent , we neer take it last word . indeed , we may read young dying priest archetype death way life light coming technological wonders new way life . century he would died alone slowly like dog , portrayed here , offering up his suffering physical pain . then we see him crossing huge new train station lille struck wonder revelation if modern secular cathedral . surely this epiphany opens us jungian reading . it must least bring us reach this amazon access old copies bernanos associated commentaries cited critierion delightfully informative commentator . truly this film which merits place your dvd and/or theological library . more than five stars	1

originally , masyles brothers only altamont make documentary " west coast woodstock " nothing more . little they know they going center what media later dubbed " death hippie movements " . this film excellent , one greatest documentaries ever . it really goes into detail how whole altamont concert itself royal screw up . it such haste incompetence it miracle they managed even get concert off ground . altamont horrible location , terrible parking ( there amazing helicopter shot where you see cars stretched miles ) , there just overall sense extreme chaos . even when i watching this , it hard figure out exactly where stage terms stadium itself . promoters stones themselves really wanted one-up woodstock . it really nothing west coast " love " . immortal words frank zappa , they " we're only it money " . zappa , others , spot how hippiedom really joke , it also shockingly naive , this film illustrates . it seems stones thinking everything going work out somehow , there going wonderful , gentle love . naiveite like get you killed . hell angels given insurmountable task here trying keep security this chaotic mess . it foolhardy entrust notorious motorcycle gang security nearly 400,000 people . considering angels drunk oblivion time , prone violence insanity , fans lucky only one person murdered . this film really captures chaos murder this festival . it shows meredith hunter , man who killed angels , indeed gun , he seemed intent doing something or killing someone night . we'll never know if he really wanted kill mick jagger ( some speculate that what he there , or it could angels just wanted pick fight him ) . transfer film here first rate . it vast improvement over muddy vhs copies . brilliant documentary ..	1
now watched dvd star ! julie andrews , only echo what i said when first seeing this movie 1968 , it rates 10/10 entertainment value . it seems not minute too long , andrews attempts valiantly ( though not always successfully ) , her interpretation volatile , charismatic gertrude lawrence . production values second none , julie never looked better . extra features dvd extensive trailers , production featurette , sections script , shooting diary , sketches tests many 125 costume changes worn julie movie(never equalled since single movie)a must all fans , people into movies there simply entertain . triumph robert wise saul chaplin . 11/1	1

i'm sure i'll get some flack declaring this best surf movie . i don't intend take anything away endless summer , step into liquid , etc . but such movies more documentary . other examples such north shore , while entertaining , fall short cinematic . big wednesday semi-autobiographical story director/writer john milius . many made comments regarding films philosophic take life , surfing , friends , i'll just make few comments . - films pacing slower more deliberate than most films , giving it almost literary feel . admittedly , some would call it slow . - story epic scope , matching it pacing . - it seems stay true surf culture . - it holds great entertainment value if no other reason than seeing jan michael vincent william katt before their sitcom days ( air wolf , greatest american hero ) , gary busey before .... well , before his rehab days . big wednesday part my movie library . if you enjoy thoughful , coming age films , surfing , buy dvd	-1
