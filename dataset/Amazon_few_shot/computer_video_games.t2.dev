when i first played this game , i got bored 10 minutes . all you shoot kill people nothing , police chase you you shoot them , bring girls into your car it them . i dont recommend this game all its overrated	1
first , let me say i whole-hearedly agree review tiberius . back glory days counter-strike ( 2001-2002 ) , this game be-all end-all 1 ) online video games , 2 ) first-person shooters , 3 ) pc games , 4 ) any video game basically . it real-life weapons , graphics superb time , maps extremely well-made , system requirements still obscenely low , damnit it fun . then , inevitabely , hands time began take their ruthless , indiscriminate toll . video cards supported better graphics , new ( yes , better ! ) games came out ( battlefield 1942 , unreal tournament 2004 ) , hacking became unmistakable poison counter-strike , lot cool , casual gamers grew up or moved . 2000 2004 , counter-strike went utter joy sensation fading diamond nuisance . 2004 present day , it become problem . great games great game developers losing tons money because people still playing this game after five years their mom worn-out 640 megahertz pentium iii pcs running windows 98 . counter-strike still one most popular games all-time , ridiculous number people playing it average day , because people just don't seem enough self-control give up their hopeless addiction . today , server admins , most part , humorless dictators , not stand anything deviates this game undeniable , monotonous drone . people still playing same maps 1.0 release , completely lost all their zest initial potential . it always feels if i've played same round thousand times before , i probably . even custom maps sickening their monotony . fy_iceworld fun 3 consecutive seconds . many other popular custom maps heavy server rotation same way , all look disguisting . i've played probably over 500 servers , downloaded probably over same amount * quality * custom maps , not more than 3 i ever seen server run its rotation , or voted players . furthermore , people still playing game using dial-up , cs veterans always complaining camping , even if its tactic used complete objective . far objectives concerned , counter-strike basically become deathmatch game . no one listen anyone plan ( rare occasion there one ) , no one tries rescue hostages , everyone always calls someone " p***y " or " nub " if you use auto shotgun or awp . top it all off , valve cancelled outstanding won.net replaced it this steam garbage , utility soaking wet incompetence . l337 speak also gained mass popularity jaded counter-strike culture , become its own incessant frustration . but i won't even get into . if you're new cs , don't bother , veterans this game far friendly , you'll probably get called bunch names involving lots zeroes threes if you're beginner . now , if you want indulge yourself great online game , check out world warcraft , battlefield 1942 , sven o-o , or even team fortress classic ( dated game * awesome * community yet lose its initial charm )	1
all i say this game not ' everyone'!! you able read play ! last time i checked not everyone read . i bought this my 13 year old son ... who autisum . he master just every game i get him but he can't read . so , him this game not much fun . i ended up playing more than he i didn't even enjoy it	-1
this game 25 minute introduction or story . square enix really creative stories so good ! however i expect them put something like " skip intro " cause impatient people could really get mad stories ! i , however only get game every five months so i am fine . this only minor flaw . flaw when you want look map or statistics , you wait 5 seconds until it appears . very annoying , but again minor flaw . this game depends how much you like battle same creatures over over over again ! it get very boring after awhile . you train those dumb spirits sometimes you just want them level up quicker . this game gets very boring after awhile you want ditch game well characters . there not much action you limited amount monsters battle . 1.0 ~ 3.5 ----- terrible 3.6 ~ 5 ----- bad 5.1 ~ 6.5 ----- average 6.6 ~ 8 ------- good 8.1 ~ 9 ------ great 9.1 ~ 10 ------ must buy excellent ! graphics- 9/10 great sound -9/10 some voice acting but great fun - 5/10 depends how patient you how you react battling same monster over over again average- 8 my grade- 7 goo	1
graphics aren't most important part game me . i already owned oblivion when i bought gothic 2 because i hoping it would darker more mature " oblivion " style rpg . while it much more mature content than oblivion ,.. i never got see it because bad controls ,.. bad collision lack fun . ( bad collision i'm talking your character walking through or getting stuck objects . ) only weapons you find first tree branch tiny dagger . there no easy enemies fight level 1 character . even little gremlin looking guys first cave pond beginning totally beat crap out you ease . controls make combat unfun chore . i'm patient forgiving gamer but gothic 2 barely half quality elder scrolls 4 : oblivion . if you've never played oblivion don't xbox 360 or pc run it ,.. then maybe you'll get into gothic 2 . it much lower system requirements	1
this game just original + crappy beam system where you spin right when you lock beams gamplay totally repetitive also their isnt any game transforming all !! i hate this game so much !! it literally worst dbz game i ever played { i played them all ) i advise you if ur looking new dbz game wait next one because their shure isnt anything new here but crappy beam system . not buy this game ever !!!!	1
try before you buy ! this game major glitch : its save game files erased sometimes , so you start all over again . beware	-1
game itself very interesting - storyline engaging controls unique . it rpg , which quite switch mario . major problem this game interactivity - not enough it . specifically , there far too many cutscenes not skippable . many these cutscenes lead directly into boss battle . most frustrating instance this just before final boss battle - it takes 10 minutes get " real " fight prior save point . this isn't problem first time through sequence , but if you lose 4 or 5 times , this just becomes hassle makes game not really worth playing see end . this major problem most game designers found work-arounds , but nintendo revealed its lack rpg experience this element . it interesting game , but just make sure win , or friend/sibling/(enemy ? ) skip through dialog sequences you if you get tired them	1
i used my remote all 8 times before it stopped working . even proprietary dongle inserted into controller slot you cannot control this thing controller , you must use remote control . when you take dongle out dvd , screen come up telling reinsert , so if either dongle or remote get slightly injured or malfunction , then you've just wasted thirty bucks . i feel quite ripped off . low cost dvds nowadays , it much better idea buy standalone imho , you get good progressive scan $30 or $40 , which comes out same price . side , it also extremely annoying you can't turn , or off device remote , you must go up box it yourself , especially annoying if you just want watch dvd your bed crash afterwards . all all value proposition offered this product very low considering similarly priced alternatives	-1
playing icewind dale ii reminds me all those novels written american authors late 19th century . though many novels very well written , they never seemed suck me continue reading book . icewind dale ii like . it looks nice , it supposedly improves gameplay , it gives player more character creation options , but i just don't really want play it . why ? well , end day , it seems if icewind dale ii hurt extremely corny story ; it bogged down numerous irrelevent puzzles involving you running around constantly ; it just not fun its predescessor . i bought this game one reason reason i addicted baldur gate ii needed expand my party based rpg addiction realm . icewind dale ii seemed logical option . i wrong . i immediately confronted story so corny it almost embarassing take part . i confronted gameplay caused me run back forth one place constantly . i confronted battles so easy i soon bored . i tried play it again , but again i plagued same problems . i installed bunch unofficial patches , but those not solve problems terrible puzzles whatever else . overload puzzles corniness would ok if you could diverge one path you could baldur gate ii , where you could accomplish quests order you wanted . here you accomplish everything linear order could never diverge path . furthermore , story seemed retread story original icewind dale . fact , design game seemed paralell it completely . final problem this game concerns fact it difficult play if you no knowledge dungeons dragons rules . if you not know how use rogues or unfamiliar feats like , this game pose very high learning curve you may not want climb . i mostly familiar rules , but it easy see someone who not know them well could easily make mistakes or unfamiliar use certain classes ( even though rule book pretty exhaustive ) . all all , i not think this good game . i would just go baldur gate ii or icewind dale i instead this game .	1
don't buy it unless you want starforce malware your computer . i understand publishers wanting prevent piracy , but not expense replacing drivers i need(ed ) my dvd burner . check search engines see yourself . would otherwise great game , too bad it isn't playable because this malware	-1
my xbox getting red rings death , figured this most likely due overheating , so i bought this thing . not only it not fix any my troubles , i more . whenever i would bump my xbox , whole thing would shut-off instantly . found this out accident , come find out this thing very bad connections . so $20 you buy more headaches than microsoft pawning off onto us game addicts ...	-1
i always fan fighting games . far 3d ones go , i great experience dead or alive series proficiency soul calibur 2 . i fear dead or alive soul calibur may spoiled me though . recently i bought mortal kombat deception found it horribly awkward * compared fluid battles soul calibur or dead or alive . i felt same way when i played tekken 5 . unlike graceful awesome animations dead or alive or soul calibur , movements characters tekken 5 unrealistic absurd . try out christie tekken 5 example . her idle animation preposterous . if you access dead or alive 3 , try putting out leifang . her idle animation thing beauty . every one her moves flows perfectly one next . this kind grace seriously lacking clunky tekken 5 . now let us speak character design . tekken 5 characters boring uninspired . they run gamut miscellaneous boxer 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , miscellaneous karate fighter 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . oh . there also few shrieky girls tight clothing , some which seem asian , if that your thing . then there guy cat mask . awesome sounds , it looks silly game . if you ever played practice mode dead or alive you probably recall fondness there feature shows each move command top screen keeps it there until you successfully perform move . this feature , useful it , not present tekken 5 . fair , it isn't found any other fighting game i played , but it really should . without further ado , let me simply say i not recommend buying tekken 5 if you ever played soul calibur or dead or alive . intro video much excitement game offer ( i especially enjoyed suicidal bicycle girl rescued kitten ) . * but least mortal kombat deception puzzle kombat , which rocked my socks	1
i started caesar2 back when it came out . i played it hours hours loved it . when caesar3 came out i bought too loved it even more spent even more time playing . both caesar2 3 rarely crashed . things changed!i'm spending more more my time restarting caesar4 than i am playing it . 8 out 10 times i access area where you trade other cities it crashes . without trading , you make little money game essentially over . other problems i'm seeing overall performance . i don't fastest machine ( amd 2.1 ghz , 512ram , rockin ' video card 256meg mem ) but there irritating 1 second delays addition crashes . i find whole game difficult use . this not case caesar3 . unless they issue patch , i'm feel frustrated crashes . maybe i dumb down graphic setting get rid delays . my suggestion ? wait patch before buying --- or move . - jason	1
this preview spoilers game please don read it if you didn play it ! i played xenogears when i saw xenosaga episode kinda short compare xenogears battle system but ok because xenosaga like " introduction " . ok improvements : gameplay longer than episode 1 ( i ended episode 1 everything 42 hours ) change ep2 ( 88+) . sidequest like plus if you want it it if you don you end game anyways . idea epiloge after you finish game very cool because you could kill special bosses get better kill final boss overkilled stuff like . chaos jr momo shion kosmos looking improved they looked more grow up . battle system put them up or down depending who you using or fighting well double tech attacksall characters able use all magic skills long you buy them your skillpoints making able sidequests . momo bow very nice improvement now she very good damage dealerrecover mp while stock good idea well use ep freely without any trouble . people complain because history focus jr urtvs but title says itself ( jenseits von gut und bse ) means " beyond good evil " wich means " rubedo worring ladies danger his red dragon mode wich makes him go out control ( possible reason sakura death ) , albedo his obssesive love rubedo but same time kill him well , nigredo wich refused mission ( involved rubedo ) killed his own father but he plays good person moment albedo said " giving life 1 hand delivering death other " . honestly second episode history role more development than first one because wasn introduction we starting know how things going ... what they wrong : i don see how they could think throw away tech attacks going good idea ... good thing they added tech attacks special attacks ep 3 you stock lot times make good combo characters(wich made battles kinda boring)music battle kinda boring compare ep 1voices chaos(sounded boring ... ) kos-mos ( like fake silly girl trying play robot ) shion ( pushing like " i better than you " ) momo ( very annoying ) sad thing my main team chaos kosmos momo thats why i got sad voice changes but they said they refix their voices episode 1 third last episode . ep 1 almost 8 hours movies ep 2 4:30 hours ( i guess complains long movies)i still don get it movies give more motion storyrole game wich most attractive things xenosaga over most games . episode 3 4hours full motion movies but plus speak texts faces included while characters move stuff like valkyrie profilethey cut completly close up when they cast spells or hit lights stuff most time you see characters back all way while you fighting . ( they fix ep3)in resume everyone know episode 2 bad things but well good things ( every game ) no they shouldn it bad when they noticed things people like game itself . good thing they fixed most bad stuff episode 2 episode 3 . battle system soundtrack characters voices all better only thing i didn like episode 3 battle mode they make it appear average rpg system ( attack , ether , tech , special tech , others ) so forget 4 combinations make tech attacks ethers cost " ep(cp ) " special attacks cost boosts . i wonder if attack give some " ep(cp ) " later . even all this i recommend you buy it before you get episode 3 because you losing lot storyline if you don more now they cost 20 dollars each ( or less)atte : roy_master	1
i've never bought wireless controller before ... so i wasn't sure what expect . but it turns out , this probably most comfortable video game controller world . logitech wireless ps2 action controller every bit comfortable dualshock 2 , then some . it very curvy controller fits almost too perfectly into palms your hands , buttons placed great . buttons never noticeably stick , full d-pad hundreds times better than sony segmented d-pad , analog sticks extremely sensitive , responding lightest touch , there start/select/analog buttons there 9though analog called mode this controller ) , new button turns vibration or off . placement these four good enough you won't using them often anyways . lag time wonderful this controller . there no noticeable lag whatsoever . radio frequency causes no interference , reciever small barely noticable , if not bit , dare i say it , " cute " . controller weight excellent too . it runs batteries , yet unbelievably light . battery door not stick out back uncomfortably either . your batteries also last you 50 - 300 hours vibration on/off . you won't even know you're playing it when you're middle violent gunfight somewhere . it just good . size also comfortable barely larger than dualshock 2 . plus , there no cords trip over , pull out controller slot , or add mess cords behind your entertainment center . there one small bad point this . vbration feature not good dualshock . but there just too many good things here this controller make it invaluable buy , even this minor drawback . verdict : guilty charges most invaluable piece ps2 hardware ( aside console itself ! ) world . sentenced bought consumers around world . case dismissed	1
this my second ps2 . i traded my first xbox 360 , which only lasted 91 days before it died ( read all it my 360 review ) . leary version 1.0 ps3 , i opted go back ps2 its proven reliability copious games less money . i got set hdtv cables , wireless controller , not looked back . what fool i fall microscams empty promises ! this best game system ! you even play online free ! games more challenging last lot longer than 360 games , which i could beat week , playing hour day . warranty awesome 1 year parts labor ! i am not worried , however , because i my original ps2 10 years without issue before trade-in ! fantastic system unbeatable price ! i keep this one least year before trading it ps3 , once all bugs fixed price goes down $400 .......... until then , long live ps2 !!!	1
unlike any other game you've ever played -- best possible way . i am easily bored and/or grossed out traditional racing , shooting , killing zombie games this game refreshing change . challenging enough keep you entertained quite long time . other reviewers said it ends too soon , but game lets you repeat each level beat your previous best score . so , if you barely beat level , you it over until you totally blown it out water . perfect pair obsessive-compulsives like my fianc� me . he thought it looked stupid when we bought it but now he plays it more than i his 6-going-on-7-year-old-son loves it , too . there isn't anything would inappropriate any age , but kid younger than 6 or 7 probably wouldn't get it . ( after he goes bed we play insanely gory jaws game -- you get shark !! ) you might think rolling up stuff make big ball would get old fast , but king all cosmos keeps it exciting challenges surprises . levels just get cooler cooler . also , music fantastic . it you singing no time . na na na na na na na na katamari damashi ! it doesn't even make sense but i love it ! i just ordered second katamari game , " we love katamari . " `nuff said .	1
i loved this game so much i gone got second copy , mine stopped working ! i love feeling entire world lives within game you always just steal car ride , listen radio take vice city many sites . tommy vercetti - excellantly cast ray liotta goodfellas fame gets out slammer goes back his turf . he gets sent vice city get him out way because really , they don't want him around anymore they certainly don't want answer his questions why he got jailed . you ride bikes , take cars , helicopter fly over city , go through districts different cultures work many gangs . bikers , columbians cops even , accompanied sound track beats heck out any other game i've played . radio enough variation keep everyone happy they their drive-bys cruise looking women . talk shows ! classy touch . game play smooth barely bug seen flows day night back again city sync , vice city night amazing , you also get weather variations impact , rain , bikes tend skid more you fall off . it kind attention detail means game never grows tiresome . hidden jumps all manner vehicles taxi/paramedic , etc missions mean game really so open ended . it three years i'm still exploring vice city . classic	1

i'm going keep this short because game doesn't deserve review longer than actual game play . great idea , tons fun , addictive , short . my only complaint , just when i digging game , i beat it . alittle disappointing , definitely worth $20 , just make sure you something else after you beat it	1
overall , i am pretty happy this unit . my only complaint it little underpowered far grabbing my router signal . my laptop 5 bars basement , but i typically only get two xbox 360 this adapter . because this , it drop its signal occasional my linksys wrt54gs router . however , it also 50 ft . away ( assuming direct line ) two floors several walls way . still , using this unit much better than figuring out how hardwire my xbox two floors away . setup breeze . i plugged it ( it snaps nicely into back 360 plugs into nearby usb using short cord ) , went network setting 360 , selected wireless slot , found my network , typed my wpa key my router . . it took all 5 minutes start finish . until buying this , i just dragged 100 ' ethernet cable down steps through doorways anytime i wanted connect xbox live . what pain ! this not perfect solution if you lot space stuff your router xbox 360 , but fine my needs , which mostly includes downloading xbox marketplace , occasional online play . if you avid xbox live player , you setup like mine , you might want consider hardwire solution . you may ocassionally lose your signal middle game .	1
this very flashy , very fun car chase shooting game . you get over 20 different vehicles guns . tv-like gameplay makes good story line . there hardly any dialogue cut scenes , but this one first ps2 games . gran theft auto : $50 . driv3r : $30 . starsky hutch : priceless	1
xbox dvd movie playback kit very easy set up use . all you plug little receiver into one controller ports , put dvd enjoy . buttons remote responsive easy get used . however , xbox dvd system very simple . it doesn't any eject buttons ( something mentioned many times other reviewers ) not many options more expensive stand-alone dvd players . you keep mind it made people who already xbox don't want shell out extra $50 dvd player lot special features when all they want able watch movie . dvd itself runs exactly it would good stand-alone dvd player . it sort like one those little $100 digital cameras . there isn't anything really special them . they just take good pictures you put your computer .	1
i agree some reviews rush need keep up happiness tied immigrant status . said - i spent endless hours researching building thoroughly enjoyed this game . well worth cost enjoyable . i am not familiar other civ games - looking more city building game set past , similar my favorite game children nile - perhaps explains why i not disappointed	1
this game fun play but not greatest game either . course movie way better than game . game pretty easy short considering there 18 levels . storyline beginning could alittle better well . some missions pretty hard but after you pass tough ones it just gets easy again . all all it good game . i would recommend it . graphics good , i like how they put some storyline movie . it not bad game play .	1

much said technical aspects or systems requirements game , many reviews oblivion other next-gen or advanced games market today . caesar iii quite old , sequel always going further system demands . it worth wait . let talk game : basic gameplay intuitive . not lot you haven't before . interface pretty standard minimized off screen screenshots or just zooming around without distraction . which you really should . all these types games , you spend lot time building developing . you need get cup tea sit back this one , closeup views city work play what so new here . graphics look somewhat standard zoom out , top down view . there lot looks familiar . until you start get closer look texture details come life you realize there level realism here you watch shadows lengthen plaza near sparkling fountain midday sun moves across sky trees sway breeze . wow . no other roman game out currently comes close . this everything you always wanted caesar iii somewhat cotn , ( children nile ) although buildings here more substantial better realized . cotn feature able follow behind person they move streets , saving you hassle trying maneuver camera views get realistic walkthru experience , one they should implemented here . i would liked see more variety housing , also goods , particulary food . there only three foods , grain , vegetables meat - cattle . no figs , cheeses , fruits , pork , chicken or fish . production lines very simplified , no bakeries bread no weavers cloth . grain goes households wool straight clothing or armor factories . more decorative options should available well . overall , while quality what exists very good , there certainly room expansion . i hope they address these things games come . it part appeal adds longevity continued interest game . maps overall somewhat small , although game this graphic intensive would reasonably limit size facilitate performance . there very limited sandbox modes available , least now , i find no user created scenarios currently available due part complexity unsupported editor . but again , what there very good indeed . all structures beautifully attention detail . landscape breathtaking , variety ways put your city together around terrain . enough hustle bustle city streets bring it life . i mention you zoom all way down into arena or colliseum , watch closeups games or swivel around floor arena watch all spectators coming out moving around or cheering ? i am currently running mid-line gaming system nvidia 6800 , system run oblivion fairly well . i update some drivers well defragment my hard drive run this game smoothly . i hadn't experienced many lags until i built up larger city or playing several hours my system started protest . i replaced game launcher icon installed game desktop or program files shortcut i created game file caesar . exe actually get game start , something i found forums consistent problem . there some bugs trade routes . opening them before you goods doesn't seem problem much setting ports sell goods you sell but don't stock yet . i'm not thrilled number people it takes man each prefect , but it usually seems work well enough , except high speeds where frequency fires seems increase , but if you more than two or three buildings burning you better off destroying those rebuilding than waiting them get put out . you easily find your entire city flames very quickly ! while it certainly few faults , most things matter preference adequate , clean system . core game itself fundamentally solid . it takes work build up economic stability based trade taxes how well you handle your production chains . you create , any scenario , stable cities largely run themselves , aside requests/demands empire . your ratings screen tell you things you need meet your goals . instance - prosperity would also mean higher levels housing , especially villas , well successful taxation trade . better educational coverage not only affects culture rating , it affects security rating because better education means less crime good coverage jupiter , who frequently remove all criminals his blessing . good religious coverage affect both your prosperity culture ratings you then evolve your housing . military automatically meet threat city doesn't require lot micromanagement long you everything place well supplied . stable gameplay , depth , realistic economic simulation , great music breathtaking graphics , it not only very good game but best current selection city-builders . so if you chose , i would recommend this one first . enjoy	1
honest , i little wary disgaea 2 . first game so much fun , i bit worried sequel would just suck . worry not , fair gamers , disgaea 2 takes most ( though not all ) what good first game builds upon it . incredibly humourous localization ? check . colorful anime-styled artwork ? check . detailed , amusing , slightly outdated 2d sprites ? check . highly amusing strangely moving storyline ? check . etna ? check . dark assembly ( new improved so it much more enjoyable) ? check . my only quibble they stripped out lot unlockable classes , which takes little bit fun out obsessively levelling your characters . however , you tell my rating , only quibble , it totally balanced out all other improvements they made . overall , if you enjoyed first game , you'll enjoy this one just much . i'm so very thankful this not suffer " sequel-itis .	1
i've only this controller few days , i found layout same black controller . i wish thumb controls little softer , they hurt my thunb while playing exciting game	1
this first karaoke revolution game i received , i enjoy it very much ! however , songs game i found quite old , even someone like myself , senior college . i dont know rest you , but 80 blur me . i didnt know these songs very well , which put major hinderance game play . i liked high amount songs they put he recent game , but i already ordered karaoke revolution volume 3 after seeing more recent songs i would know . i found " sing dance " mode challenging , if you dont know song heart , dont play it , because you need watching arrows where your feet should going . i would also recommend wireless microphone dance pad ( if they exist ) since cord get way your dancing moves . i thought it really cool game sense initiative , over 50 different unlockable items ( although 90% which items you use create your character , or just new character ) . some songs listed here need unlocked through game play . i'm sorry i couldnt think every artist these songs , but if it isnt listed , assume its least 15 years ago . 1 .

xenosaga : episode 1 took us . although flaws game many , story sufficiently entertaining interesting warrant praise given game , clunky play mechanics . xenosaga : episode 2 awful . plain simple , it awful . any interesting cliff-hangers episode 1 either answered stupidly , or not all . game not only possessed lackluster storyline , extra characters introduced merely confusion sake , but i never seen battle system more user-unfriendly , more monotonous clunky than episode 2 . times , i wanted throw my ps2 against wall , particularly when fighting patriarch . terrible game which seemed kill series ...... until episode 3 , which throwback simpler rpg fare , works quite well . episode 3 , battles actually interesting fight ( least early - i enjoy use boost counter once ! ) . no more you guess whether shion attack useful against enemy , or whether you should switch , say , chaos . instead , characters divided into three classes : attackers , defenders supporters ( healers ) . it pretty simple system , no ? also , story kicks back into high gear . i won't spoil anything , except say finally , testaments , which alluded episode 1 but completely ignored ( other than tangential referral ) episode 2 , returned , let face it : wilhelm much more compelling character than , say , young albedo . finally , wheels which began spinning episode 1 come full circle . fact , it seems if episode 2 could skipped entirely , no loss continuity . there numerous nods xenogears this game , way , gear sequences actually quite fun ( character battles episode two only trumped boredom ... gear battles ) . any case , xenosaga 3 worthy addition library . it flaws ( again , it would nice action sequences movie sequences move more seamlessly , although it infinitely better than episode 1 or 2 ) , but it fun game	1
this game remains one my favorite games all time . i'm old school game , i've played computer games since i atari st cartridge . i played other gta games , i liked them very much , they all addictive . this one , this one trully jewel crown . there many things i could say , but i just don't want repeat same waffle . it great game , characters all superb , voiced great actors . ray liotta just fire tommy vercetti . i'm still suprised they got all this talent , there seems no stone un turned , even blondie get minor par t.t his many thumbs way up . indeed , it notorious , it not minors , though no doubt there more minors played this than adults . lot it subject matter just kicks , just teh kind amusement we seek because it kind thing we would never normally our wildest dreams ; other part , inmo , jsut sheer style . i can't recommend this title enough . only possible downside it , this just picky loading times various parts city . this eliminated san andreas , but this one one . " i run this town ! me !! " - tommy vercetti	1
pros : 1 . character creation fun , detailed basically unmatched any game market , much better than nwn creation system . 2 . graphic beautiful , but if you expecting fully 3d environment , you disappointed . 3 . music just awesome . 4 . i mention character creation fun ! playing your custom made party very satisfying experience . any kind team playable , you solo game too if you like . cons : 1 . not feature 3d environment like nwn2 . gameplay linear , but i didn't care point my game develope my character	1
star wars : jedi knight ii - jedi outcast . third game star wars dark forces series . introduction : i've pretty much always fan star wars , you may guessed , i'm fan many games based series . although star wars games often hit miss , when one succeeds , it usually succeeds beautifully . one most interesting ideas star wars game dark forces , released playstation one pc . although game itself horrendous , terribly-choppy framerate very poor level design , it something world never seen before - star wars first-person shooter . sequel , jedi knight , cleaned up lot problems , added some new innovations . now third game series , jedi outcast , arrived . like previous games this sub-series , it gotten multi-console release . read see how it fares ! overview : jedi outcast star wars first-person shooter . game one-player quest , well several different multiplayer modes . review : put it simply , this game everything original dark forces should . while not perfect , this game huge improvement over its predecessors . once again you play role kyle katarn , agent other dark forces titles . second death star destroyed , but many imperial forces still fight , so it up you infiltrate their hideouts exterminate them . graphics , most part , solid . i impressed how good they this kind game . nothing state-of-the-art , but they're still pretty damn good . control also given overhaul rightfully so , since this game lets you use force powers wield lightsaber . single-player mode extremely entertaining , fact game offers multiplayer options only adds overall value package . you save whenever you want single-player mode ! but , course , game isn't perfect . like earlier dark forces games , level design just not good . too many areas look alike , there too many instant death spots just too easy fall into . likewise , many cases your objectives unclear , some puzzles pain - i don't know you , but i buy first-person shooters shoot people , not solve puzzles ! because imbalanced puzzles often poor level design , it took me over hour just beat first level ! huge problem availability . lack custom control configuration also plagues game . this huge problem , since game limited control selections often clash what you're used this sort game . this game wasn't released gamecube very high quanitites , so you're gonna shell out full new price just get used copy - my mind , it not worth price . sad but true . i recommend this game star wars fans , just warned it not perfect , it hard get copy . edition notes : this good game , but some strange reason it just wasn't available gamecube very long . because this , even used copies fetch close original new retail price . this extremely annoying people like me who want get every star wars game . still , you should hunt it down if you're into this sort thing . overall : overall this best game dark forces sub-series thusfar . where game succeeds , it succeeds beautifully . i am impressed game , it just shame gamecube version not made readily available all would-be players . i strongly recommend this game if you get hold it - i doubt it disappoint any star wars fan .	1
i played several nancy drew games this far best one . i recommend this game anyone .	1

while it shares name " chrono " many people think it horrible sequel , it fact not direct sequel like so many people think it . it very well rounded amazing game play , it follows up twenty years after fall lavos . keep mind when playing this game it chronological sequel rather than direct sequel so many people fail realize . while game numerous playable characters , it still maintains very good story , if you follow it closely , but times , become very confusing if you miss certain details . chrono cross net you around 30-40 hours gameplay , if you don't stop playing game extended amounts time , story just becomes completly amazing	1

mario kart double dash essentially mario kart 64 then some . game brings alot new cards table , which i review below . mario kart double dash improved last game immensely , saying alot , because mario kart 64 one most fun games available n64 . first way it improved previous game allowing players choose 2 characters race instead 1 . this makes bit more complex control scheme , but otherwise doubles fun . game also features tons available characters play : mario luigipeach daisywariowalluigibowser baby bowserkoopa paratroopababy mariobaby luigidonkey kong diddy kongyoshi , andbirdothe game ol ' grand prix mode time trials , but it also some new unlockable features , such : new cartsnew charactersa new circuitnew battle mode stages ... more , but i don't want spoil anything . mario kart double dash multiplayer modes better than ever , too . not only battle versus modes once again available , but there new types battles : shine theif babomb blast . all all , mario kart double dash extremely fun replayable , enough features unlockables keep you occupied entertained while . i enjoy it , i think any gamecube owner should pick this game up . i reccomend renting it first see if you like it , then making your decision . thanks reading , bubba " samus	1

i got earlier design this controller . it bigger felt better than regular dual-shock . only down side it analog sticks . top curves like bowl not like knob no grip which means my thumbs kept slipping off . this new controller away problem goes back old knob style analog sticks more grip ... but it size regular controller now but rounded . it fit well hand uses only 2 aa batteries . this controller great , but if when it stop working like other reviewers say , i swap out analog sticks my old logitech controllers .

i recieved this gift christmas day surprise . however , there mishap wal mart i guess mic they told my parents would work actually didn't so i hadn't able play until yesterday . however , now it all sorted out i finally able play using usb ps2 head set . game actually so much fun . first time i tried i went familiar songs , so i selected " pieces me " . i so bad first time it laughable , it failed me just i started second verse . but game gets so much better after your first few tries . after while i easily getting gold expert judging ( i immidiately like challenge myself ) . i breezing through songs i grew up loving such irene cara " fame " , wild cherry " play funky music " , vicki sue robinson " turn beat around " . then i going through songs dominating my cd player not too long ago such ashlee simpson " pieces me " , incubus ' " drive " , beyonce " crazy love " , hilary duff " fly " . it even better classics such madonna " material girl " , blondie " call me " , commodores " brick house " , whitney houston " i always love you " ( one many i haven't quite nailed yet ) . now order make platinum beyonce you actually sing like her ? no , which makes game very accessable . however , it doesn't hurt familiar your singing voice . over all this very fun game only one problem . while songs may fun , it very very diverse . sometimes too diverse it own good . take example when me my mom want play , songs we personally know two different erras . i'm wanting bust out " call me " , she wanting " i left my heart san francisco " . this creates only problem : unless your all around music-know-it-all ( which i'm not quite there yet ) you'll end up doing same songs over over again . but this really doesn't bring game down . if you've around listened wide variety songs then you should able cover good 30 songs . not mention , it would make great party game . i would suggest getting this game if you're into fun while not afraid make fool yourself	1
this so wonderful . i 7yr old ( boy ) 9yr old ( girl ) they cannot get enough this . my 9yr old sleep over other girls now want come over all time play ! i even some parents inquiring it . this so much fun , even my husband i great time playing . kids love you creat your own characters change their outfits anytime when you well you unlock new songs outfits . we can't wait get microphone so we more .	1

( yes , i'm 29 years old she still can't it ! ) . i'd recommend this game anyone not looking advanced game requiring weeks play advanced storyline . if you like tetris but want little more variety just little more skill requirement ( good laugh ) , this game you . there something oddly satisfying rolling over dog seeing his legs twitter air when 5 minutes earlier he pushing you around ... weird ? yes . fun ? yes . i'd say good 12+ years because young kids may find this too boring because they won't appreciate how strange cool this game really	1

( way , avoid ds game called " sudoku " . it unnecessarily clunky entering data . ) this appropriate game seniors who like math/logic challenges even if they've never used computer . plan spend some time tutoring newbie , then watch he or she enjoys challenge	1
this game reminds me alot grand theft auto series . while it many similar characteristics way you get around town , go into buildings , way you interact environment it still manages offer few original interesting components gaming industry . this game great storyline fans likely enjoy . even if you weren't fan movie this game still must . like gta there few side missions ( not massive gta though ) , there collectibles , then you main missions way . while object game take over new york , some warehouses businesses get repetitive , but its mostly all fun . one plus police this game tend less hassle unlike gta games . this lets you keep playing rather than stop restart safehouse or police station . this helps speed up game . controlls take time get used but after you play little while you good go . if you like gta format style play you certainly like this . also if you like godfather , storyline game great really stays true movie . while its not best game year it certainly until new gta comes out . it took me 2 weeks finish game playing few hourse each night . i hope they come up godfather 2 . we see ...	1

this truly amazing game , especially considering it made small independent developer . there virtually infinite number different unit types , spells magic items so game never gets repetitive ( this possible * because * it doesn't rely massive amounts graphics ) . different nations each their own style play . ai challenging even when set " easy " . you download new maps other modifications internet . i only reduced rating 4 because problems interface . it sort unfinished feel it . example when game ends , it always exits windows rather than main menu . also , running multiplayer game very difficult requires executing two instances game simultaneously	1

red dead revolver , far , one best western games i've ever played . game easy learning curve also . after hour or so play you all controls down , you'll hooked or otherwise very interested . it one best story-lines out any other games i know . basically , western tale revenge renegade southern general his colonel . you play red harlow whose father brutally murdered right front him colonel darien , again , general diego right hand man . i wouldn't say this game bad rating makes it . there no actual dismemberment , rating " blood gore " says , use curse words kept minimum . if you've seen any pg-13 rated movies , two could relate . it fun time killing game , if you're bored , great replay value people who don't plan finishing single player modes . there tons characters choose multiplayer mode , both good bad . multiplayer modes numerous also , including things like showdown dueling modes . downfalls this game short story mode overall simpleness it . there aren't many ways you get creative it . but , greatest thing it i believe : sheer hilariousness it ! me friend sat played it more than 4 hours night once , sat holding our sides , crying , because laughter . midget clowns character reactions funny . especially how it sometimes glitches up . once during boss fight very fat character , fat enemy got hung stairwell , because he too big go through it . overall very good game ! you should buy this , if you like this game , you may want purchase gun too . gun copied off red dead revolver most part though . both games very short stories too . if you like good western great replay value , then you certainy love red dead	1

great remake , but where fast forward ! my kingdom fast forward button ! this great game ! cut scenes nice touch helped draw player into story line , but would someone please give me fast forward/skip button . i understand makers game want you get involved appreciate storyline , but without fastforward/skip button , this game game limited replay value . i already played through game once , now i am running through it again , i am going insane ! long cut scenes , seemingly endless , " next " clicks fine first time , but come ! game 3 different endings you would figure developers would give you break ! ok , now i said , lets get back review . character development use magical items , while definitely not unique , but they helped flesh out fight scenes . combos skills moves made game interesting kept me coming back . while i would liked see graphics slightly change when different equipment used ( swords , helms , etc ) combat special moves graphics definitely nice . should you buy ? sure if you like rpg game definitely buy , but fore warned ... prepared read , read , read , click click click , before you even get your first fight scene , even then expect much same long before you get things your own	1
i purchased copy game year edition end may , 2006 . it now almost september . i playing morrowind three months most week day evenings 4 hours most weekends 12 hours . game great graphics , character interaction fairly intricate though times repetitive , game ai monsters non-player characters fairly advanced , game manipulation fairly easy learn , layers complexity somewhat challenging though not overwhelming , most importantly one or two puzzles i come across thus far straightforward resolve . most various quests not terribly intricate difficult so they lend themselves jumping few hours then taking break . i wanted game would visually appealing , simple game manipulation mechanics , interesting but easy puzzles , mysteries , above all provide immersive virtual world explore . i wanted inexpensive game would run older 900mhz amd thunderbird nvidia fx5200 128mb video card 1 gb ram . morrowind fits bill nicely . i ignored all faqs manuals how play game most those provide spoilers instructions most opportune or expedient path . i discussed game some my students who moved oblivien , fourth game series . all all , this best 20 bucks i ever spent game . previous this i played call duty civilization ii extensively some other strategy games bit . i play dungeons dragons group friends college some 20 years ago so fantasy ideas embedded game familiar	1

one most common complaints xenosaga ep . ii battle system annoying ponderous because " even ' regular ' battles , it forces you spend many turns stocking just so you decent damage enemies . " this actually form codespeak . what these people really saying " i'm not very bright , even after several hours playing ep . ii , i somehow never realized how use battle system efficiently . " ep . ii puts great deal emphasis each character attack attributes . attacks classified either physical or ether , then there elementals ( fire , ice , lighting , aura ) finally there types ( slash/pierce/hit ) . sound complicated ? eh , little more so than average rpg . not nearly bad something like vagrant story . all you use analyze any enemy you're unfamiliar see their weaknesses , then use change command bring character proper attack . when you come across enemies physical/elemental weaknesses , there ethers which you cast add element character physical attack . if their weakness ether/elemental , then just use standard elemental spell ethers against them . this all you need make battles flow nice , normal pace . some reason , vast majority ep . ii players seemed never realize this . instead , they saw their only option using stock command nine ( nine ! ) turns row before beginning their attack . even wimpy garden variety wandering monsters ! they took no heed enemy weaknesses , using characters physical/fire based attacks against enemies weak vs . ether/ice . rpg players used reputation more intelligent gamers . i wonder what happened ... lot ep . i fans never bothered play ep . ii because negative word mouth spread so quickly amongst fanbase soon jp version released . but now ep . iii out ( it truly fantastic ) lot them finally play ep . ii soon . i hope they better than first rounders	1
when i heard square putting out game disney fronting it i even keel . i don't much love disney but rings true mario well i still played mario rpg . however , unlike mario rpg ( here just " mario " ) final fantasy ( ff ) characters weren't featured . i'm all little cosmetic upgrade squall cloud since graphics when their games made now quite gap . one thing i didn't expect some most powerful beloved characters video game history would take back seat kid key weapon . these two protagnosits particular much more emotional development struggle then " sora " ever . this beyond frusterating . after all cloud through , he still seen this weak willed person no direction or purpose life . squall other hand ( unlike cloud psychological battle ) , huge distancing emotional issues overcome , especially abandonment . but ff8 he showed final boss greiver what . know i put so much time 2 games gave me reason truly care all 8 members either given game , i couldn't care less sora his friends or fate every disney world . lame square lame . you some most highest grossing games both rpg over all history you still sold out disney ? i come expect more company caused me stay up so many nights , miss so much homework miss out so many life experiences . thank god you didn't disgrace some your more advanced titles ( xenogears vagrant story come mind ) . well thats my review any true square fan take it or leave it but while you play your game just remember who your dishonoring	1
