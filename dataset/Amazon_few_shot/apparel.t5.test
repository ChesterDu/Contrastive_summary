these shoes durable , comfortable , most importantly come different widths . most other athletic shoe manufacturers apprarently don't make anything but width . new balance . those you complaining width , my guess if you size your feet correctly , problem go away . i always worn 12d width , until some gentleman mom pop store sized my feet correctly first time my life i found out i need 13b . you may think you know your feet , but you may not . comfort , i can't complain . durability , maybe they little stiffer , but if what extends life these shoes over others , well worth it my book	1

i am technically 32jj ( per some lingerie store lady ) , but worn 34 dd ddd since high school ( i'm 27 now ) hunt good nursing bra ( 33 weeks pregnant today ) . i tried " medela seamless underwire full fit nursing bra " 34g 34h . this one most supportive , but underwire ( which after 8 hours , i can't wait take off - i've always committed underwire wearer ) cup fits , but i'm nervous if it fit once my milk really comes . i also tried " fancee free foam support soft cup nursing bra , " which i also got 34g 34h not most supportive , but comfortable ( i wear this one bed , around house , etc . ) . so , regarding goddess bra - i just got 34g yes , cups little big , which i'm so thankful because certainly allow some growth they aren't so big my breasts look silly through shirts . not mention , cup part looser mostly around nipple ( i've instructed begin wearing nipple shield , so it allows room so-not-inconspicuous item ) . my favorite part back portion , which stretchy cotton not dig into my ribs end day like others . it also pretty supportive , maybe 9 out 10 supportiveness compared medela - but steps above fancee free . i likely buy one more this style - call it day buying nursing bras because i finally found what i'm looking . i'd recommend buying one cup size below what you normally wear if you're looking wear it right now you may wear size up after milk comes . this bra really got me excited - enough after 4 years ordering amazon , this first review i ever compelled write . hope you find same success this bra , too . good luck	1
i found these shorts run little bit small size so make sure you give yourself extra size up make sure there adequate room move freely . follow care label first wash or two until they get broke because shorts bit stiff first due their scotchgaurding . tip : make sure you wash them before you wear them . i would recommend these shorts most anyone who looking durability , comfort , and/or needing professional look garments they wear . note : if you looking extra pockets go dickies cargo route . these not any extra pockets	1

oh my goodness ... i don't know what i would without my spanx ! i never wear pair work slacks without them . nice pair trousers some polyester involved it ... well this stuff clings bulges panty lines . spanx gets rid vpl smoothes out those little areas we don't like mention . so fabrics little more flow them , actually flow not cling ! you look more neat tidy your clothes you might even look few pounds lighter . they so comfortable because it thin nylon material , you wear them during warm summer months . don't fooled imitations ! spanx brand only one you want when it comes quality doing what it promises ! i recommend medium control even if you little bit tummy hide ( it still works well me ) . super tends little tighter so size up if you going get them	1

i really like this travel clock ~ lightweight , sturdy , compact even tells temperature ! i really like it displays alarm clock time also - shows whether or not alarm function ... even shows when it snooze ~ snooze 4-5 minutes , there indiglo light bar - which same snooze bar located across top clock - very convenient easy find ! clock alarm very easy set you go up or down so you don't scroll through whole sequence get back your time ... setting hour minutes separately . all buttons beep when pressed - even light/snooze button - but minimal compared all great features conveniences ~ it quick beep much less loud than others i tried ( less beeping you hold down button automatic scrolling when setting time ) . i highly recommend this travel clock ! enjoy your travels	1

i purchased six these chairs august myself my friends before start college football season tailgaiting . they all made this manufacturer ( north pole ) different nfl logos them ( i only bought one through amazon , others bought through different companies due availability issues ) . first game season , my chair ( steelers ) broke . second game season , two more chairs ( bengals broncos ) broke . they not misused no weight limits exceeded . they all broke same exact place ; plastic pieces base legs all cracked . therefore , 3 out 6 broke within probably less than 3-5 hours . needless say , $25-$30 each i would recommend prospective buyers spend their money elsewhere	-1

i first purchased this bra specialty bra boutique 139.00 ca . i know it lot bra , but i too happy i found bra fit great . up until day i wore 36d or 36dd , after getting fitted i am now 32 . you understand i hate shopping bras , i never found right one always walk out store thinking i should get breast reduction . this bra one oprah wears loves . now it my favourite thing . i agree other customers it not prettiest bra if you bigger chested gal like my self , but you forget when you put t-shirt or blouse , because you really look 10 pounds thinner around waist you chest where it should . if you bigger chested gal , i would suggest before buying this bra , if you not too sure what size you , go get fitted proper store .... specialty store . most stores only sell bras a-dd cup , why you should go specialty store , sales women know lot more	1
i many different types sandals , but never owned pair birkenstocks . i think price what kept me buying them always gotten sandals without reguard who makes them long they $20 range . after my last pair fell apart i decided spend extra money birkenstocks . i am glad i . you tell how well made they right out box . they extremely comfortable wear , footbed firm but soft . longer you wear them more comfortable they get . i like birkibuc material better than leather it seems more water resistant . arch solid just right spot proper support . part where strap attached sole seamless very well . i am very happy purchasing sandals i recommend them highly . your feet won't hurt wearing them all day like some sandals or flip flops . one thing watch out , it says size measures true but first pair i ordered much too big i send them back smaller pair . i used conversion chart seller , but you may want order half or full size smaller than you normally would . ones i now size 41 supposed size 8 us , but i am true size 9 these fit me room spare .	1

we ordered nightgown size 6 my 4 1/2 year old daughter . she bit tall side we wanted nightgown last while . nightgown itself no problems - contstruction seems sturdy , no visible flaws , good printing , even if it little darker side . she claims " ariel my favorite princess " , so there no way it wasn't going hit her . slippers came nightgown too small size 6 . they didn't even fit my three year old who wears size 8 . i'm guessing these slippers around size 6 . i would thought they would sized slippers size nightgown , but now i suspect they make them " one size fits all " ( aka " one size too small " ) . besides too small , there nothing pull up over heel , so they constantly slip off foot . they discarded after 15 minutes when my two daughters realized they looked like more fun than they actually . tiarra obviously cheaply made . we weren't expecting any more than . my 4 1/2 year old left it ground first evening she got it accidentally stepped it breaking it cleanly half . honestly , i relieved i could get rid it quickly . i'm giving product 4 stars because what we really buying nightgown . lack 5 stars due poor construction sizing slippers - they could better job . tiarra non-issue us	-1

tutto ok per venditore prodotto . la spedizione internazionale dovrebbe comprendere il corriere espresso . la posta normale tende ad abbandonare l'articolo sulla porta di casa con il rischio di un furto da parte di un malintenzionato . inoltre i tempi di consegna troppo lunghi non permettono di pianificare eventuali regali . ho acquistato l'articolo per regalarlo mia moglie , ma purtroppo � arrivato dopo san valentino ... sigh	-1
