this adorable guitar it perfect size my two year old but it made cheaply . strings loosen after he strums it couple minutes which means i'm retightening strings each time he plays it . i guess you get what you pay ( afterall , it only $14.99 ) !	-1
forget all silly little earbuds . these best pod phones out there daily urban use . they sit well enough ear , sound fantastic you don't violate your ears foreign objects miss all subway announcements . so what if other people sometimes sort hear what you listening - this only problem if you blast your music cube farm if going , you far bigger problems your life	1
i don't know how nady supply mic , cable stand $25 . mic isn't anything write home - it no shure sm58 , but it better than could expected probably worth $20 its own . then you xlr mic lead - try find one under $10 anywhere . it actually reasonable quality too . you get mic stand - you'll spend $15 equivalent stand . it prefectly adequate mic stand . indestinguishable other mic stands i've purchased $20+ . you can't go wrong this package . mic not pro , but stand , cable mic , it amazing	1
these great fun ! my daughter loves shake them sing . brightly colored good quality . they fun whole family just right size small hands . they good play other than just musical , they sorted according color ( if you get more than one ) put into things taken out again ; they lend themselves hours fun	1
well , i started kay $1.99 special they play good too but once i saw how fun harmonica is- i stumbled onto little better harmonica , old , old hohner american ace it played so easy , i get top line hohner got this special 20 key " . " it take little while break special 20 before it played easy sweet it step brother- american ace . it more contained , refined sound than other two i mentioned bends well . i still find my american ace bends easier but it probably 10 years old reeds weaker than my brand new special 20 . i am still curious lee oskars but history hohner , average $7.00 cheaper than lee oskars , fact it made germany , i opted special 20 . awesome harmonica awesome price . they also short waranty unlike other brands .	1
