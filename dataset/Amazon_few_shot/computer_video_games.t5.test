this game , simply put , not good . i got bored tears playing it , then ended up giving it away because it robbing useful space my desk . it slow-paced , predictable , not suspenseful all . fact , these characteristics probably why it so mainstream , even though it laughable comparison real first-person shooters , which way don't even belong consoles . owning this game means you average player . any true fps gamer knows what childish , pathetic garbage this , while rest just go hype . many successfully deceived themselves into thinking it worth anything all . it isn't	-1
i really wanted like this game .. unfortunately me , it blows . i'd trade it migraine if i could . gameplay pretty horrible , sword scenes reminiscent pc adventure games circa 1992 , where you press " attack " key swing your sword aimlessly bad-guy . run gun part game nothing write home either . it feels like teleported into body cracked-out , 1 legged , drunken monkey . also , i know graphics aren't wii strong-point , but no excuse regress back 8-bit . when you're trying shoot someone across room , it really sucks when you can't tell them apart flower pot ..... or lawn chair ? cut scene obviously supposed look like sin city . i stress word supposed cause they probably strung together some poor intern after development team went into hiding . they look like amateur flash slide-show . kinda like what your local mom pop video editor would put together if your little nephew gotten his way sin city themed bar mitzvah . this game joke . anybody associated it should embarrassed .	-1
i'll make this short sweet you . i went cyber cafe so i play this " gem " see what all fuss this game . overrated . i no idea how people prais this " best game world !! " ... how silly , this game just plain average .. if you wanna play nice game valve .. i don't need tell you but i'll give you hint .... h***f l*fe ... this game just pure garbage online boring ... i don't need your flaming or bashing just cause one mans opinion differs yours .. goodvisuals good i guessbadvery mediocerplain boring combat ... nothing newonline isn't greatextreamly overrated ... trust me .. gets boring after awhileand yes i played this out more then 1hour ... 2 bucks i'll never get back 2.1 out 5 stars .... extreamly overrated , not worth my 2 bucks , that all i got say .... peac	-1
i really looking forward this game , i prepared overlook one or two things . every game it own personality , right ? i found instead this game actually doesn't much one all . i didn't mind graphics . not cutting edge sure , but not bad either . little muddy but change cartoony . it hard enjoy closeup views , however , when so many buildings lost their roof zoom . no way toggle feature . camera angles frustrating it very difficult pick anything out mouse accurately . not there much time look scenery . immigrants came . came . came . whether there houses jobs available or not . long city happiness high enough , which meant everyone happy . which they not . because they no houses or jobs . keep city happiness up only way ensure somewhat stable economy . forget planning . forget balancing resources workshops markets . it wasn't clear what balance any case . it would take trial error , you didn't time . you building worshops like mad , trying guess how many citizens would employed each , researching temporary bumps keep your city deserted droves . best income boosts not through sale goods or trade . it through research , maximising tax base development currency so . you hit those early , reached certain population level , you made money . rest time you spent trying keep people leaving . there no stability reaching any level . it quickly became game keep up . there no way control immigration or set pace development . all decorative options , more than similar games out , you really didn't care end what your city looked like , because it just cost time . money too , but really not relevant issue . unless people unhappy . then you could stick few things , quickly , somewhere . you just can't enjoy leisurely pace planning , building finishing it off nudge here there watching it run ... you constantly involved process , staying ahead curve . you don't worry maintenance , such city fires or engineers , but cities cannot not made self-sufficient or self-sustaining this inherent instability built into gameplay . five or ten minutes away screen bring most cities , if not all , screeching halt . while i enjoyed research options , ability move homes i thought great innovation , not ability control flow immigrants city pegging success city happiness makes this game poor economic simulation gameplay ultimately very shallow unsatisfying .	-1
i found only one game out many i tried codes this thing actually work . this action replay basically twenty dollar or more waste plastic cardboard it came . avoid like plague	-1
easy ... boring ... bugs , bugs , bugs , glitches , glitches , glitches ... question ??? this new game , or possible bonus maps cod2 they decided make into new game profit more money ???? hmmmm ??? positive ?? you cook your grenades now . i like mine medium rare ... possibly useful online matches , apposed cod2 where you couldn't it point less throw grenade online matches because you knew where it could just move . but i never know , because i " thankfully " rented damn thing , didn't buy it . wait , i didn't my dad , free rental blockbuster . so they didn't get any my hardly earned money . good me ... also could anyone tell me why i kept getting stuck walls , tanks , people , just everything . i think i stuck air ... if you like this game , you need get f**k out , buy something else play , i so i meet up you beat you ... also , if you don't like my run sentences you .... yep you guess it ... get f**k out .	-1

bought this platinum game much anticipation it doesn't work all . tried download . exe patch nothing top it off half original game forum sites crash too . no one any idea how fix this game all you look dozen patches out first game . if they spent time money build game test it right like blizzard companies like westwood then they would release finished game but decided use everyone gunea pigs test product so they could try patch it work . not buy anything this company or its affiliates i think they alkida implants trying take over western world . if you want play game style then wait until june get " titan quest " which should finally diablo 3 . too bad this company couldn't find capital complete game before release would think anyone wanting buy spellforce 2 should warned upfront make sure you wait 6 months after release buy additional hard drive so you download new patch fixes they probably try smoke screen you they count their money send it iran	-1

karaoke revolution party fantastic game great songs , great easy gameplay perfect party game features . if you've never tried karaoke game , now time play . first , basic setup . you get fully customize your character . we're talking black , white , male , female , heavy , skinny , athletic . then you go hair styles , hair colors , outfits down shoes jewelry . you evey use your eyetoy scan your face onto face character . it simply amazing . then we go onto song list . i own probably every karaoke game out 3 main systems . i love karaoke games . this song list far my favorite song list all time - it true my boyfriend well . there good mix jumping songs , slow romantic songs , rocking songs more . other karaoke games you go through unlocking venues songs . because this party game , they pretty much give you everything up front , few exceptions . you unlock few songs ton characters / outfits you go , keep things interesting . few standouts include elvis outfit cat outfit . addition able sing both single player duet modes , there bunch fun mini-games . you compete against other players , try play note-matching games even set up eye toy so you see your own background game . even better , if you dance pad , you sing dance same time ! this really great building up your vocal powers . many people sing fine if they stand still like stick , but when you sing band you're actually expected move around dance . using dance pad helps you build up your lung power timing so you get those skills . even if you're not band , you see challenges your favorite singers face . this game ton fun both friends party mode , or just singing yourself songs . where some previous versions karaoke sometimes " questionable " versions songs , them obviously different original , these songs great sounding many times i didn't look song bar all sing them . highly , highly recommended !! rating : 5/5note : previous reviewer says this aretha franklin version natural woman . i'm rather sure it carole king version	1
phoenix wright : ace attorney fun game . it simple . graphics ( 4 out 5 ): i would say graphics par most ds games . they could better , but they don't retract all gameplay . they fun same style games like sprung under knife . audio ( 2 out 5 ): audio where most ds games fall short . i am content graphic abilities ds , because quite simply graphics don't make good game . sure they help , but gameplay entertainment truly lies . it knowing this kept nintendo top handheld market . i just wish ds little more power behind it audio sake . i would like speaking characters throughout entire game , especially game like this . music so repetetive , it got so annoying i found myself just turning sound completely off . i guess they best they what they work , but this case , it just not good enough . gameplay ( 5 out 5 ): far gameplay goes , you couldn't ask much better experience . you put role pheonix wright who his first trial defending his best friend who accused murdering his girlfriend . eventually you go work other cases way you required gather evidence use court suppport your defense . characters over top lot fun interact . this text based game i suppose you might fan genre really appreciate it . but it simple pick up play game held my attention beginning end . i really trouble putting it down . while game like sprung got little monotonous came down more memorization then common sense questioning . phoenix stays track area logic plays more part solution cases . i highly reccomend this game !	1
i've my 360 since day one , it worth every dollar . let me start saying there nothing , nothing compares xbox live 360 . microsoft knows online gaming , they know gamer . end month you able download high def movies rent , tv shows free . online community set up help guide you gamers like yourself , people your skill level . sony can't this , ninendo can't this . they try , but xbox doing this years now starting original xbox . so called problems ? all systems them first couple months release , it happenend gamecube , ps2 , we seeing ps3 . i also want mention poster who said not put 360 verticle , not clue . you put it verticle , or horizontal , it works just fine . it turns out , many systems crashing because people got scared rumours , bought nyko cooler . it turn now reported , back pictures , etc . it causing many 360 burn out , it nothing any 360 problems . i personally 360 , soon nintendo wii , i say overall scheme things ... games , online network , options , accessories , etc . you can't beat xbox 360 . not only , sony hype machine wants tell you it graphics better . reality , programmers , 3rd party developers saying they equal graphical power , but you force fed lies hype sony side . not mention much higher price tag . all bs sony , fanboys throw out there . 360 worthy buy ! you really can't go wrong 360 , buy premium , get best game out there ... gears war !	1
i'm 36 years old i played many football video games many different consoles over years i must say this game stands out above all rest ! there " zillion " college teams choose ! stadiums beautifully detailed ! players , coaches , referee models , their animations , superb ! when playing stadium natural grass surface your players get grass mud stains their uniforms ! friend mine my workplace this game longer than i says occasionally player helmet fly off after big hit ! i yet see it happen but i'm looking forward it ! crowds look sound truly alive ! fans celebrate hold up signs ! cheerleaders even teams ' mascot look fantastically detailed their celebrations exciting ! espn college gameday crew , brad nessler , lee corso , kirk herbstreit provide interesting funny game commentary some but not much repetitiveness ! it pretty cool when corso makes his winning pick gameday booth before game he wearing either his picks ' mascot head or teams football helmet he speaking ! overall gameplay great learning curve fairly easy especially if you're familiar madden series ! ncaa 2006 you adjust your game settings , etc . any way you like reset them default touch button!i'm not much into all different options many sports games such creating teams , players , playbooks , making coaching decisions such ( although you all this game ); i play solely visual atmospheric stimulation which this game particular provides ! my opinion ncaa football 2006 blows other football titles out water it total package ! football fans , get this game !!! you feel like you involved actual college football game complete all emotion pageantry ! you become addicted it you want play it over over again !	1
leave it me start into series its ' second , third , or fourth installments . this case , it fourth . course , there good explanation why . i set out looking final fantasy iii : dawn souls my gameboy advance(hey , if you're going collect series , it good thing start beginning ) my local videogame store but they only final fantasy iv advance so i decided get it instead . there isn't much i say hasn't already said other reviewers here final fantasy iv advance . story goes like this .. kingdom baron quest collect all elemental crystals . commander its air force , cecil , dismissed after questioning king motives . help others ; cecil sets out stop growing threat , meantime , uncovers far more dangerous one . it deep story alot twists turns deeply challenging game due active time battle system . i can't recommend this game enough . it one my all-time favorite final fantasy games . although they tweaked graphics , translation whatnot abit , they pretty much made game it originally . i think final fantasy fans well casual rpg gamers really enjoy this one .	1
microsoft created extraordinary machine . crisp graphics so far library games available impressive . only problem i microsoft produced defective product . first few months it played fine only aa couple moments where games would freeze . no biggie . then it died . no problem , sent it repairs under warranty . free charge . cool . got it back it played well me actually beating ghost recon no problems . i stopped playing while but when i tried playing again bam ! ring death . warranty over . $130-140 dollars fix . yay . i think i'm going throw it against wall buy new one . hopefully microsoft found all solutions defects .	1

there two major factions when it comes video games , if you weren't aware their existence i'll happy illucidate you . group 1 , far most numerous , console gamers . group number 2 , one which i subscribe , based pc games . i'll first admit pc gamer i tend view consoles suspicion my experiences they place looks , flash , hefty price tags above gameplay plot . console audience tends younger than pc group , these very aspects which appeal them . so it equal parts hesitation excitement i felt i put this game onto my hard drive . those not know , once upon time , back early days microsoft x-box , there this nifty game called " halo " , my how console gamers snapped it up . i saw commercials tv course , thought it looked pretty good , but felt it too bad it x-box title not one available my trusty ol ' pc . " halo " puts player squarely armored shoes master chief , one kind super-marine engineered bring big guns covenant , consortium deranged religious aliens bent destruction all humanity . no ship allowed go earth it location closely held secret which covenant wishes possess all costs . but earth losing war , precipitating creation new super soldier , spartan-ii . just before spartan used covenant home planet latter launches surprise attack facility destroys all but one ; you . gambit elude pursuit last ship left , pillar autumn , jumps into hyperspace ends up orbit around strange ringworld named halo , but immediately attacked their pursuers , who seem tracked down autumn no time . now , complaint number one i this game stems fact * everything * i just described not taken game itself . it comes game manual . plot this interesting should least included opening scenes . c'mon microsoft , you money , pony it up spruce up introduction . it good plotline , so don't waste it manual , which only kept desk drawer some juvenile next 10 years forgotten until next decade spring cleaning . plot ( first gripe ) now aside , let focus game itself . i refuse judge game it age , too many nowadays ... instance , i still play original half-life think plot gameplay more than make up aged graphics . game looked fine my pc i never experienced anything close screen lag . colors contours alien world ship hallways nicely rendered sound ambient noise above average . music itself nice choral sequences ( such featured menu screen ) downright cheap midi sounding music , which felt out sorts rest game . weapons selection small but surprisingly good , any given situation you'll likely access weapon/s needed surmount it . i particularly like plasma pistol it supercharged shots , well everlasting mainstay fps games , shotgun . ability drive vehicles included game , something separates halo most other fps , it lot fun . particular i loved driving scorpion tank , which demolishes everything it path . you also fly around enemy banshee light fighter , which made getting past couple levels much easier . game plot flows smoothly voice acting pretty good . now gripes . right off bat i say level design single biggest detraction this game . beautiful outdoor environments used this game , but not * nearly * enough . you'll spend most it traversing hallway after hallway , which connect rooms look * identical * one you just left . doing this 2-3 times enough , but when you spread out level runs outwards up 3 hours * same thing * , it gets reaaaally stale . case point , chapter/s which you spend time monitor traveling through library . this section game draining seemed without end . it wasn't fun , just stressful . level which player introduced flood felt much same , although it still lot fun . vehicles fun , but require mouse steer . this obviously remnant x-box , where players steer warthog control toggle-thing , but i found mostly it me skidding against walls occasionally flipping . ghost only vehicle i able use strafe keys assist steering . enemies themselves tend get little stale after while , during my first couple hours playing i wondered what i gotten myself into . grunts , little pointy-backed gnomish aliens , spend most their time running away speaking ewok-accented english . it very distracting considering nature other baddies they seemed little out place . lumbering hunter , who super armored , also incredibly stupid . first i trouble negotiating them , but soon learned employing certain attack patterns i could easily waste one under minute . other aliens tend use good combat tactics i found dealing them more difficult . plot itself , which i classify very good , bordering great , kept me interested . it ain't half-life , but it works well enough my curiousity piqued halo 2 , which i might go ahead buy near future . i'm sure halo released pc first , which what originally intended , it'd left recognizable mark fps shooter platform . so that . very good game one which i look forward continuing storyline master chief , killer extraordinaire !	-1

nfsu capture idea ' building racing cars ' but i think they could go little further into design your so-called ' pimp-mobile ' . only interior you get design trunk , i think they could least seats , or wheel . outside design a-ok . anything sideskirts multi-colored vinyels you make your car fierce . plot-line single player mode really dosen't go deep , your just some guy who wants get his title back . multi-player you race your own cars tracks you already won , but down-side whole graphics two player horrible . it game worth getting , but you might sell it later .	-1

one might suspect gta : san adreas classic anarchist fun insane driving , guns galore lawless protagonist , linear storyline . let honest though ; nobody buys gta just play mission part fact i hard time getting into missions . san andreas there even larger area gameplay few other cities explore once you advanced game ( unless you want cheat ) . clear aspect sets this game apart previous ones depth gameplay . haircuts tattoos available purchase . you various parts your character built up -- fat , hunger , muscle , driving skill , weapon skill etc . obviously when you get fat you need run around eat when hungry . others self explanatory . some new rather interesting vehicles ave added this game . hydra , which harrier type jet , stunt plane , attack helicopter , four wheeler , parachute , my favorite -- jetpack . other than game like each created before it gta 3 . graphics even fairly modern computer still leave much desired . whatever engine they use clearly same gta 3 . animation other hand very natural realistic . music radio stations lackluster , but i believe it possible use your own music instead . computer game san adreas ' controls very least awkward because sheer number actions . worst case scenario -- hydra -- however using keyboard fly plane downright nerveracking . if you want shoot something below you , sure compensate couple seconds , not because it moves fast but because you need time angle nose plane direction . i , myself use xbox controller which adapter use usb port computer . even it not much better you still need d-pad make decent turns . you tell this my biggest qualm game . overall grand theft auto : san andreas lot offer if you don't regular gaming console but compensated clumsy keyboard controls . i would rate it 7 out 10	1
if you enjoy series you love game ... simple . very entertaining . don't miss it	1
let me say yes , this game too violent kids but beyond , it totally awesome ! graphics better than those found san andreas i enjoy robbing stores greatly ! you also notice your health armor decline more rapidly this game than sa . ok , so it not three super detailed cities but it one nearly perfect city ... vice city perfect parody 1980s miami missions seem pretty reflective . storyline what you would expect but voice over acting exceptional videogame . two main characters , tommy lance , sound better than characters most major motion pictures . i started my adventures gta san andreas but fact , i am enjoying this game even more ! anyone who liked either gta iii or san andreas , pick this up way , avoid lib city stories , it just too dull after while	1
this game took my 9 year old son 2 days complete . it disappointment since i paid $30 it , but action adventure games make younger kids make wiser decisions . overall this game deserves a+ . not adult type game but fun kids .	1

i unlike lot other people not buy this game when it first came out . my initial thought what squar thinking . i thinking this could nothing more than childs game . it wasnt until i talked number other people , right before kh2 came out i finaly listen all those people spend $20 get game , ( price game then , ) low behold , time i finished watching just opening scene i hooked . i played game what seemed like hours , ( it really only very long weekend . ) but game became so addicting i immediatly went out bought second one day it came out . story line par final fantasy , final fantasy vii , my two favorit games world . i would recomend this game anyone even slightes bit imagination . if you even dare dream you instantly love this game i . it well worth price , my only regret i not buy it sooner	1
don't listen other reviewers . this game great . far beats out sim city 4(and i game ) . it challenging make everybody happy , but if game easy .. it wouldn't fun	1
i believe this best game genre . it gotten more play out me than master magic , heroes might magic , age wonders , warlords , disciples , civilization , alpha centauri , master orion , space empires , or stars . once other posters says they bad support , but that not my experience . i've found their continued support patches good or better than any afore mentioned titles -- not bad 2 man team . there amazing amount variety factions would-be-gods you play , best all it most part solidly based upon mythology -- far superior typically dd derivative fantasy . multiplayer fantastic . it complex game however , not everyone tastes . definitely check out demo first . beware though , it addictive stuff ! also check out fan made maps their website well , some which quite pretty . if you're stuck getting started , try excellent walkthrough bruce geryk , also linked their site	1

castlevania : dawn sorrow first 2d version castlevania , i played long time . well onest , first one since castlevania ii : belmonts quest , came out nes back 80 . i never got play super castlevania , or amazing psx versions(which i should , after playing this game , buying 2 previous gba games ) . this amazing change ot games me . original , it really hard beat , made you frustrated . ii fixed it little , made you search dracula body , then destroy it , but frustrating , you no real direction most weapons tended suck . this however , amazing game . it eases you into game , you lot hp your disposal , regain them(take 1980 games ) quite often , potions , or save point , or souls . souls great thing , am loving it previous game well . they range you not taking much damage , growing tail , shooting lightning or bombs , letting you throw doll , switch places it . i enjoyed this game , determined finish it . i don't currently 100% , but my first time through i got 98% which nice , because i played games through , you finish 48% you completed entire game . touch screen not used often game , but when it used it used well . you only need it destroy few blocks way , input magic seals whihc you need defeat bosses get through certain doors . it plays great , although you cheat not hit points perfect , long your quick(which good thing , most people not perfectionists , or if they , really slow ) . game difficult , but not overbearing like many series past . i loved this game , play it long time , even though i beaten it before . i try julius mode , which more traditional , difficult castlevania game using belmont(finally ) whip , no souls , no potions , it tough , but i enjoy it greatly . if you own ds , you need own this game	-1
xenosaga ii-jenseits von gut und boese came november europe first xenosaga , which released here !!! but we european players never played xenosaga i before , so namco released second xenosaga great " special box " . this box game itself movie-dvd nearly all xenosaga i movies . back topic , my opinion xenosaga ii pretty game cool movies battle system makes fun . music this game composed yuki kajiura movies shinji hosoe rest game . i think kajiuras music really good but shinji hosoe bad job , his elevator music ;o )the graphics okay but i couldn't see anything outstanding . end i must say , xenosaga ii good rpg , even if it not so wonderful than first xenosaga . that reason , why i imported xenosaga i your country ^_ ~ but last most pal-players happy , actually ( my dictionary doesn't give me right english translation " ueberhaupt " ;_; sorry ) xenosaga ii come europe yet !!!! so i look forward third last xenosaga hope , this episode like first !!!! many greets germany ..... viele gruee aus deutschland ^	-1
this probably one my least favorite ff games psone . there some good things some bad things this game . first bad : 1 . squaresoft ( now square enix , goddammit ! ) trying get old roots snes games . me anyway , it doesn't look entirely like those games . 2 . some characters worst ff games ' history ( quina , eiko , garnet . i am not sexist , it just their abilities suck their type combat terrible ) . other characters good , not great , but decent . 3 . i don't care too much character models ( deformation final fantasy 8 graphics mix ) . okay good parts game : 1 . cinemas !!! they look really good psone game , most games cinemas psone don't look great this era gaming even some during era . 2 . ending !! i am not saying anymore . 3 . battle system . it not quite ff8 not quite ff7 but it trance system thingy . after this game , i sadly am seeing series not good it once ( i like final fantasy crystal chronicals can't wait remake ff3 ds ) , final fantasy 10 isn't legendary , ff 11 , which i never never play ( because fees , reminds me too much like phantasy star online ( i like game though ) , not much single player expericence no storyline ) , ff 12 just because it ff11 battle engine , looks like ffcc ff10 mixed together , i just seem not care much newer ff games anymore . so i would recommend any ff game psone ( including psone ports snes games origins ) because they so great even if games don't best graphics world , it gameplay storylines count	1
i'm avid final fantasy ( ff ) fan . when i found out they making game devoted my favorite male character , vincent valentine , i stoked . after pre-ordering this game , waiting forever get it , i expecting usual action-packed fighting detailed storyline seen almost all ff games . sadly , though , i little disappointed . dirge cerberus first person shooter ( just you , armed enemies lotta guns ) based final fantasy vii character , vincent . gameplay pretty decent , multitude different enemies fast-paced gameplay ... times . graphics , however , biiiiiiig let down after initial fmv sequence . guns pretty basic far usage , but equiptment system confusing materia system just plain weird first . i'm not even going start item limits ... game isn't overly difficult or overly easy offers few different modes gameplay , easy-hard , unexperienced veteran players . voice acting pretty decent i personally thought voices matched most characters well . now , story . any ff fan should know how much let down these last few ff vii sequels ( movie games ) . they're not bad sense game development or outward beauty , but sense storyline . dirge cerberus takes story complete tangent . lucrecia vincent past given series cut-scenes chance encounters while new , completely out-of-the-blue characters come make difficult process finding out vincent dark history . though it casual flare any ff storyline , it more so resembles two ff movies its science fiction/wannabe horror elements . old characters brought back , new frustrations raised ( hinted ) love interests nothing ever seem go right planet once again . overall , this game isn't bad . it isn't great , but it isn't bad . avid ( very avid ) fans series should check this out if they wanna know what really happened ( though they should watch carefully things didn't match first game ) . if you're player new series , play ff vii first or you won't get full impact game . if you don't really care just checking this out heck it , don't buy it . your money better spent good first-person shooter like metal gear solid	-1
first glance average person might assume appeal grand theft auto graphic violence , swearing mature content but truth gta series revolutionary technological achievement remains one most impressive experiences you find gaming . first time i ever tried gta : liberty city i absolutely blown away size scope fully realized , living city . it same feeling i got first time i played mario 64 i recognized i witnessing major leap forward . now almost 10 years later rockstar treated us their latest effort , gta : san andreas . liberty city prototypical big east coast city while vice city combination vegas southern florida . san andreas takes gamers west coast shades san francisco , la points . always city gigantic fully realized way true crime series could only dream . fact i noticed billboard san andreas mocking true crime . gta always freedom ; freedom walk , drive or bicycle wherever you want , freedom walk up pop someone mouth if you want . sure it violent but consider it wish fulfillment those us inner anarchist who desires expression without messiness accountability . only other game even approached gta scale mafia but mafia saddled unforgiving law enforcement wouldn't even allow players run red lights . unfortunately , not everything sunshine palm trees san andreas . vehicles extremely difficult control . problem vehicle movement camera angle work independently which means when you make turn using keyboard you quickly swing camera around using mouse realign yourself . even after considerable practice i still found it very challenging awkward . shooting likewise rather challenging perform i just don't remember it this hard two previous games . other surprise how taxing game my pc . i played first two gta significantly weaker machine surprised i couldn't max out all settings san andreas . i pull drawing distance significantly keep frame rate up while using p4 3.0 ghz 1 gig memory ati radeon x600 graphics card . i knock one star off because awkward controls but gta one those games you could spend month never get board . just exploring city worth price admission .	-1

when i think entire series such final fantasy , this game always seems odd one out . ffviii not take medieval or archaic look others series . i hardly agree gamers who not see potential this game . ff8 takes lot unique elements more noticeable than other ff games . one elements very unusual storyline . my opinion , storyline rather impressive . though it overshadows blossoming love 2 main characters , there not lot predictability storyline . no hidden characters no actual villain remains same throughout game . element gameplay . characters able draw distribute elements little more refreshing use than materia junction systems previous ffs . graphics final fantasy 8 very exquisite . cutscenes enough illustrate game without drawing away gameplay . i especially enjoy soundtrack game . i mix all video game music my ipod often am confused which game it comes . ff8 distinguished composition makes it stand out other video games . lot gamers know , ff8 takes series direction other games not take . lack mini-games definitely issue . while triple triad fun addictive take , it hassle reload or restart game if you lose valuable cards . also , trading some these valuable cards items hassle too . i found myself desperate need invincibles use defense against final boss . guardian forces ( almost forgot them ) exciting acquire too . spending numerous time sidequests should not requirement beat game though . also , ff8 spends little interest developing secondary characters but i praise excellence overall dialogue writing . give ff8 shot favor yourself gamers who feel like it definite miss	-1
eye toy play 2 much better than first . while first limits what you could actually , this one very few . there much larger variety games , different activities . such running during baseball game , dodging searchlights while collecting items , chopping pickles smashing tomatoes , defeating three-headed hydra so much more . during multiplayer mode , you get take picture your face which then placed head robot monkey , which hilarious touch . also , during multi-player mode , when tie occurs , players get tie breaker form fun little mini game . downside this , if you want play minigames anytime , you force tie , which pain . downsides eye toy play 2 : some games more frustrating than challenging , instrutions booklet aren't very clear . like most eye toy games , you turn all lights nearby open curtains get decent enough lighting . even when camera set dim room . video messaging terrible . you don't get choose background like original eye toy , image small distorted . playroom difficult find , there limited ammount games , some which make no sense . like , when it asks you put brightly coloured image front camera . it just weird . overall , eye toy play 2 completely worth buy . it hours endless fun , games never seem get old	1

this unique game takes keen eye ability remember small details . many times , whether or not you're successful depend how good you finding inconsistencies testimony , or things " just don't sound right " . animation very lo-tech , where each scene just stationary backdrop . if there character you interacting , they cycle through their 5 or so generic facial states it suits dialog . there * lot * reading , unfortunately , some characters love talk . music simple infectious , interface easy navigate either via touch stylus or buttons , you save your state game any time , so you take cases your own pace . it unique game just rewarding it frustrating . characters interesting , if you own ds , this game worth	-1

i won't say cooking mama best game i've played recent months . surely , there something more important than cooking - like , killing zombies x360 , example . however , it certainly most innovative , especially when you consider how much you limited dimensions nintendo ds touch screen . cooking mama , you're apprentice fine art cuisine management . your master , certain mama , put you through series saliva-inducing recipes , grill you through preparation each if it only thing you live . you choose practise before hand , but when you go into actual process making particular food , you'll find there no room error . wrong move , mama not hesitate show you her wrath . making food involves several steps . some short , while some may take forever . example , when preparing pan-fried fish , you'll go through coating fish slices , melting butter , actual pan-frying arranging plate . each process turn involves different ways doing things . coating fish slices , example , requires you drag your stylus left-right manner while touching fish . melting butter requires you rapidly drag butter circular motion when it hot plate . pan-frying involves " following command on-screen " mini-game requires you perform whatever mama tells you , so . impressive thing here , even though you're just stroking your stylus throughout game 70+ recipes , you're essentially doing different things . it bit like trauma centre last year , but instead seeing body parts , you're looking food . if you're more adventurous , you even combine recipes form new ones , which adds depth gameplay . game quirky this , it understandable it uses quirky graphics . presentation cooking mama light-hearted , makes hectic process cooking ( me , least ) much more enjoyable . music little weak , even though it some nice variety . but seriously , graphics audios not what you'd buy this game . i mean , who cares these things when you've fried octopus balls make ? its sheer audacity bringing kitchen onto ds , i'd recommend cooking mama every owner ds . don't expect see your ds few weeks , however , if you bought this game , missus house . now , if only my wife learn few tips out this	1
this first time i owned madden football game . i can't compare it other games , but this one rocks ! i love highlight stick hit stick . pros : good graphics , great commentary , very fun cons : if you challenge play , it never gets reversed . it only gets reversed if other team challenges . notice i only 1 con , so this game must get xbox !	1
this one awesome game ... play it online or against computer .. i suggest online more fun long run ... if you really wanna give yourself scare turn out lights turn up volume ... definetely scariest first person shooter out there	1
red dead revolver , far , one best western games i've ever played . game easy learning curve also . after hour or so play you all controls down , you'll hooked or otherwise very interested . it one best story-lines out any other games i know . basically , western tale revenge renegade southern general his colonel . you play red harlow whose father brutally murdered right front him colonel darien , again , general diego right hand man . i wouldn't say this game bad rating makes it . there no actual dismemberment , rating " blood gore " says , use curse words kept minimum . if you've seen any pg-13 rated movies , two could relate . it fun time killing game , if you're bored , great replay value people who don't plan finishing single player modes . there tons characters choose multiplayer mode , both good bad . multiplayer modes numerous also , including things like showdown dueling modes . downfalls this game short story mode overall simpleness it . there aren't many ways you get creative it . but , greatest thing it i believe : sheer hilariousness it ! me friend sat played it more than 4 hours night once , sat holding our sides , crying , because laughter . midget clowns character reactions funny . especially how it sometimes glitches up . once during boss fight very fat character , fat enemy got hung stairwell , because he too big go through it . overall very good game ! you should buy this , if you like this game , you may want purchase gun too . gun copied off red dead revolver most part though . both games very short stories too . if you like good western great replay value , then you certainy love red dead	-1

while shin megami tensei devil summoner : raidou kuzunoha vs soulless army isn't actually smt game , it member franchise . it actually part family spin-off games megaten series just using smt name establish connections different series franchise finally appearing america . while not too many people familiar games past , this one takes series new direction . devil summoner first game megaten franchise moved past traditional or tactical rpg style combat gone straight into action/rpg genre . this game you play young man who just attained title kuzunoha raidou 14th , successor long line devil summoners tasked protection capital city . his ability see control demons , raidou must solve mystery becomes increasingly more more twisted game progresses . story begins player earning raidou name ( essentially this tutorial ) assigned work detective agency capital . one day you get mysterious phonecall girl pleading help wants meet you late night . reluctantly raidou his partner detective agency head out meet her . they find out girl who contacted them odd request ; she asks them kill her . before anyone respond , she kidnapped mysterious men red so sets forth tale demons , evil , curses . essentially game progresses much way you would expect megaten game , you travel different locations via world maps explore different locations larger area maps . while wandering around areas searching clues information , there several random encounters ( franchise known high encounter rates ) allow you opportunities capture new demons aid . more later though . while exploring areas you able demon deployed follow you around ( keep mind normal people can't see it though ) . every demon type special skills used areas such flying reach far items , scouting find hidden items enemy info , even mind reading get some extra information people . these skills essential getting information you need , so it wise keep demon every type often possible . now battles . this where fans series either love game or hate it . gone pressed turn systems used nocturne digital devil saga . instead they replaced real time action battles . you directly control raidou use combinations sword strikes gun shots defeat your enemies . raidou can't use magic , so only way he deal elemental damage using special bullets . luckily him though , he able demon deployed him battle ( but only one ! ) . it typically act its own , but you capable assigning it specific orders or general strategies . using your monsters battle , they grow loyalty you . when their loyalty maxed out , they often give you bonuses then used fusions create new demons . essentailly system get little bit repetitive while it takes while get used , once you it becomes matter knowing what enemies weak which attacks . once you figure out though , it just matter keeping your levels high enough capturing fusing demons keep gaining strength . style capturing brand new well . gone negotiation system used nocturne original smt games . instead it replaced system forces you exploit enemy weaknesses . when you hit enemy element it weak too , it become stunned give you chance capture it repeatedly pressing circle until meter empties out . you must empty meter before creature revives or you not capture it . easiest way this wear down its health ahead time before attempting capture . one note though , you automatically fail capture if enemy higher level than raidou , moon full , or it boss battle . graphics music game little different what seen previous smt releases here north america . it still uses same form cel shading , but they little bit more defined detailed . nothing too major , but it enough really change visuals overall appearance other games . also , this game not dark gritty nocturne or dds . fact it several amusing scenes much brighter more vibrant overall . this greatly illustrated music which often much more lighthearted comprised lot horns brass instruments . not nearly dark brooding other two games . but since this game takes place 1920 japan not post-apocalyptic world this time , it fits quite well . overall , devil summoner new spin old franchise . while it display full action battles aren't well suited style game , atlus able it well enough it still remains fun keeps game enjoyable . lot people who found turn based systems nocturne dds overbearing cumbersome , this could nice way ease into world megaten franchise . while it not nearly epic previous games , it holds its own story alone enough keep fan franchise sated long enough finish game off regardless whether or not they like change style . definately not best game franchise , but nice refreshing change fun none less .	-1
first off i own both nba 2k6 nba live 2006 playing both since they come out . first i thought nba live 2006 better game until i played nba 2k6 more more realized it best simulation basketball game out there . addition shot stick this year game changes way you shoot well play game . game very enjoyable especially friends because some games get very intense . overall game probably best series because it made major improvement over espn 2k5 . pros-graphics best any basketball game ps2 date . -free throws more realistic you must fluid motion if you shooting free throw yourself . -vip very extensive detailed show your stats tendecies which very nice touch those pay attention detail such myself . cons-steals happen way too often . -very challenging get 15+ rebounds . -practice mode still relatively useless other than perfect your timing your shot .	1
yes this game easier fighting game , but that why i like it personally . most marvel fighting games , there so many controls remember activating many different types superpowers it got hard keep em straight . this game only 2 basic fight options all characters it much easier figure out what you doing . course , each character it little extras such flight storm wall climbing spidey , so each character remains unique . but you don't memorize 10 different actions wolverine then memorize 10 different controls venom . i like this game lot i really love they made fighting controls easier	1
only flaw i find this game multiplayer isn't very much fun . playing locally friend means you just shoot him lot while he learns controls . no enemy ais maps	-1

i believe this best game genre . it gotten more play out me than master magic , heroes might magic , age wonders , warlords , disciples , civilization , alpha centauri , master orion , space empires , or stars . once other posters says they bad support , but that not my experience . i've found their continued support patches good or better than any afore mentioned titles -- not bad 2 man team . there amazing amount variety factions would-be-gods you play , best all it most part solidly based upon mythology -- far superior typically dd derivative fantasy . multiplayer fantastic . it complex game however , not everyone tastes . definitely check out demo first . beware though , it addictive stuff ! also check out fan made maps their website well , some which quite pretty . if you're stuck getting started , try excellent walkthrough bruce geryk , also linked their site	1
way , jak 3 more direct sequel chapter two than it continuation storyline established part one . i realize this meant end journey , " coming age " story follows title character through his innocence , his adolescence , finally his ascent into adulthood . bearing mind , it only natural he'd want distance himself people places make him feel like adventuring child , rather than self-assured saver globes . " when i became man , i put away childish things , " after all . where inspiration behind storytelling jak ii unquestionably blade runner , main source direction this final chapter comes largely mel gibson road warrior . outlanders who rescue title-endorsed duo their exile drag them back their own makeshift shanty town textbook definition early ' 80s burly man . they adorn themselves hundreds pointy edges , enormous , hopelessly detailed weapons layer after layer questionably-hemmed leather . they puff out their chests every opportunity , speak like cluster throat cancer survivors . these new characters just overflowing personality , which makes minor cutscenes motivational speeches entertaining , but i couldn't shake feeling they just going through motions attempt mimic successful main cast second game . it like they trying match edge gritty , sullen warriors jak ii , but missing some intangible element kept them reaching full potential . twists turns their storylines somewhat transparent ( i'd figured out major twist damas story within hour meeting him ) , their importance central plot thrown into question fairly early , ( when you return city around three hour mark only occasionally return desert thereafter ) all their gusto , their emotional impact player doesn't hold candle inner-city gangs ran chapter two . " last " game series , ( daxter psp jak : combat racing since released , continuing saga , there rumors new game ps3 ) jak 3 atypical grand finale . lot things didn't happen i expected during " wrap up " cutscene very end , vice-versa ... i caught off guard more than few revelations , including wizard oz-styled reveal just before final boss . first time , i think series found its stride vein comedy it sought since day one . character interactions actually very funny places - i legitimately laughed out loud more than one occasion , which not something i'm known during game . outline place unexpected twists turns counteracting few more obvious revelations , jak 3 story would set stage one greatest final chapters video gaming history - if only it bit longer . jak 3 weighs dozen hours , which less than half length jak ii , results much less rewarding experience than you'd hope final episode . it also wasn't nearly difficult its immediate predecessor , which means less screaming shouting , but also less relief self-assuredness upon reaching final scene . after completing part two , i sense accomplishment , almost pride , finished such elaborate difficult game . i didn't get same sensation upon putting this one bed . one area which jak 3 doesn't disappoint " holy crap " department . it just spoils you these things - you'll control daxter he clings dear life onto speeding missle , ( live freaking missle ! ) you'll leap onto teensy platform while camera leers above you displays dizzying heights below , you'll take down creatures size whale ... just unimaginably cool stuff . it doesn't overload action quite way god war , but it pretty close , last full hour gameplay one those long moments transcends mere video gaming puts player right into middle summer blockbuster . i've long considered last stage original halo one , if not greatest level history gaming , i'd seriously consider closing moments jak 3 least par . so , yeah , very high praise indeed . both grand finale throughout entirety game , there lot variety gameplay . this not just your standard jump , shoot explore adventure game . you'll bump into odd blend flight stages , ddr-style coordination stages , racing levels railed first person shooter segments , addition exploring , jumping , punching , shooting all-around adventuring levels . , while this something i big problem when it shoved into mechanics grand theft auto : san andreas , it doesn't bother me so much here . main reason because jak series always some sort similar variety ingrained within it , but it also bit more admissible here because setup actually works . nothing feels like it needlessly crammed into proceedings , like dance stages or workout levels san andreas ... it all just works together , several parts whole . while basic gameplay model ( its dedication consistently bending genres ) remained mostly intact , there two notable variations functionality jak ii become abundantly clear within first couple hours . first foremost much , much heavier emphasis that placed driving stages , more so than precursor legacy jak ii combined . this third chapter , they're vital completion half game levels , including final boss fight . it almost point i'd call this " action / racing " title , because you'll find yourself spending much time behind wheel you foot . when it successful , vehicle-based gameplay blast , something that never really tried before - sort supercharged platformer wheels . few stages failed , however , wheels felt like gimmicky death trap . incredibly frustrating , like trying shove square peg through round opening . largely , vehicle stages roaring success , however . secondly , there revelation there " light jak " mirror beastial " dark jak " unveiled second game . where jak darker persona brought it variety new attacks offensive maneuvers , his light side focuses more exploratory aids defensive mechanisms . such , it not quite exciting play " light jak " first time it burst into " dark jak " mode near opening jak ii . it just not much fun grow wings casually flutter around room it fire purple lightning out your fingertips fry opposition . these light powers enable few new modes exploration die-hard fan , but generally fairly useless go unused until situation demands you employ them . fas far controls concerned , it pretty tight ship this point series . most infuriating glitches bugs first game ironed out second chapter , third game actually improves upon near-perfection attained second . few jump commands go unrecognized , i some problems touchy collision detection during faster races ( which meant i hit checkpoint dead center or risk doing it all over again ) but those minor gripes best . visually , this could pass jak ii identical twin . characters look almost exactly same previous chapter , all little quirks , cartoony exaggerations background puns gave first two games their identity here living color . it not best looking game i've ever played , i didn't notice much difference upon switching progressive scan , but it near top its genre all same . i'd imagine phrase " ain't broke , don't fix it " could applied jak 3 without hesitationthe voice acting one area that kept fairly high quality throughout series , legacy kept up here . where story falters , voice actors often revive it , vice versa ... it good collaboration . scenes routinely stolen daxter / or villains , who go above beyond their pursuit good reading matches circumstances , while jak kept fairly low-key stoic . it best , too , because few occasions where he decide go all macho tries spit out line like " let go kill us some metal heads , " it doesn't fit he comes across awkward unsure . upon completing second game , i likened it empire strikes back , it took fairly light-hearted series transformed it into more adult-oriented saga , incredible results . what it worth , star wars parallel carries over fairly accurately this third chapter - you'll get lots warm fuzzies end , it not quite weighty or substantial second chapter , but overall it still very entertaining experience cast characters you can't help but love . big action scenes really fabulously , there rarely dull moment , but this game suffers unbelievable quality game immediately preceded it	-1

castlevania series games involving vampires side scrolling combat . dawn sorrows , soma cruz teenager who soul dracula within him . year ago ( game before this one ) he fight off dark powers within him . he won thought his life would normal again . unfortunately , when this game opens , he immediately comes under attack vanquish new set foes . game pixel based side-scroller involves human figures fighting skeletons , werewolves , other monsters . look definitely old school / retro . if example you ran this side side against robots , title i reviewed recently , robots figures crisp detailed , while castlevania characters screens showed granularity . it style difference many people appreciate . you primarily move left right , slashing your sword , throwing bones , performing other styles attacks take out your enemies . there some platforming well , jumping up down ladders get new areas . this works well storyline , so it not like , say , mario where platforming all there game . example , there ' hunter ' who sworn kill dracula . soma knows hunter , understands hunter fight him if he loses control himself dracula . they enemies who truce , who both respect each other , but who know if circumstances change they lock comba t.t here some touch screen aspects game . you find ' seals ' which essence patterns lines . perform certain actions - example finish off boss - you create this seal . this involves drawing pattern perfectly . you're allowed practice , but when time comes , if you don't get seal just right , you could great trouble . it neat idea , but i wish it something little less " perfectionist " oriented . i know many people who just can't draw well or who hands shake bit . if they'd gone memorization game - or logic puzzle or something - it would more real skill / intelligence less " perfectly steady hands " . general i like fun action , i appreciate rpg storyline here . i got drawn into story rather quickly . i think next version i would like see graphics kicked up match ds capabilities , ' seal ' puzzle changed less perfectionist drawing , i'd also like some dialogue less cliche . i loved ' flow ' plot but winced several comments made characters . well recommended	-1

first glance average person might assume appeal grand theft auto graphic violence , swearing mature content but truth gta series revolutionary technological achievement remains one most impressive experiences you find gaming . first time i ever tried gta : liberty city i absolutely blown away size scope fully realized , living city . it same feeling i got first time i played mario 64 i recognized i witnessing major leap forward . now almost 10 years later rockstar treated us their latest effort , gta : san andreas . liberty city prototypical big east coast city while vice city combination vegas southern florida . san andreas takes gamers west coast shades san francisco , la points . always city gigantic fully realized way true crime series could only dream . fact i noticed billboard san andreas mocking true crime . gta always freedom ; freedom walk , drive or bicycle wherever you want , freedom walk up pop someone mouth if you want . sure it violent but consider it wish fulfillment those us inner anarchist who desires expression without messiness accountability . only other game even approached gta scale mafia but mafia saddled unforgiving law enforcement wouldn't even allow players run red lights . unfortunately , not everything sunshine palm trees san andreas . vehicles extremely difficult control . problem vehicle movement camera angle work independently which means when you make turn using keyboard you quickly swing camera around using mouse realign yourself . even after considerable practice i still found it very challenging awkward . shooting likewise rather challenging perform i just don't remember it this hard two previous games . other surprise how taxing game my pc . i played first two gta significantly weaker machine surprised i couldn't max out all settings san andreas . i pull drawing distance significantly keep frame rate up while using p4 3.0 ghz 1 gig memory ati radeon x600 graphics card . i knock one star off because awkward controls but gta one those games you could spend month never get board . just exploring city worth price admission .	-1
only faults i find this otherwise great game horribly long load times how long it takes get decent car race . game very addictive , especially when it comes tuning your hard-won new car . customization your car extremely detailed almost fun racing . computer cars give you real challenge certain types races , but you change difficulty level if you find it little too hard first . scenery gorgeous ! able drive anywhere you want really fun too . i actually prefer this game over ea newer release : most wanted . i would recommend this game , but patience needed your first few hours gameplay	1
graphics : 7/10 . well , we talking ps1 port . so don't expect much here . but new cgs nice , even old ps1 sprites actually pretty nicely animated . super/special moves ( pws ) rather nice , too . sound : 6/10 . dialoguing very annoying first . it very much apparent moment you start up game , when you go through prologue . once you get used it , it not bad . sound effects seem bit primitive too , but again , this rather old game . btw , fans quickly note , game uses same voice actors pokemon . :d gameplay : 7/10it interesting mix platforming , puzzles , turn based real time combat . personally , i not enjoy platforming part . genera never my favorite , psp diagonal insensitivity makes some jumps pain . combat rather fun original . but after mid game , your characters so over-leveled over-equipped , almost all battles except few boss battles become trivial . replay : 8/10there lot here . chances , your first game , you've missed out " " ending , true ending . standard " " ending pretty mundane . there quite few characters game , you probably not get explore all them until you replay game . personally , i'm story driven player , so once i know plot , i little interest replaying game , but i think many players don't mind going through story again- such players , replay value should fairly high . story : 9/10a most excellent story . many characters you come across rather poignant stories , you learn each them , small reflections your main character . plot weaved very nicely , although it somewhat slow beginning . my only negative that keeping this 10/10 , very last scene- it somewhat left me unfulfilled . but i hear that matter opinion	-1
nancy drew : last train blue moon canyon ( 13)-before i begin ... my review spilt up into sections in-depth look topic . if you hate reading medium/long reviews or just don't patience i would not continue reading , but if you want learn most product before you buy it you'll continue . -gameplay interfacethis point-and-click mystery , arrows hands simple easy use . they also made improvement arrows since last game . hands manipulate items or add them your inventory(toolbox ) . when playing game you also panel bottom screen including : inventory(depicted toolbox , which i think should backpack instead ) camera cell phone journal , help menu button ( other games coin purse when money used game ) . main menu pretty simple . however , loading saving game little clunky you can't delete saved games . it also prompts you your decision ; it makes saving/rewriting games take more than one click . this type game interface perfect , but i'll knock off star irritating save/load page . ****-plota fairly used plot this series , finding treasure . but her interactive made this treasure finding story little more interesting . jake hurly , miner owner custom-built train , falls love young french woman named camille way finding gold . camille later dies , jake possibly finds treasure but he nowhere found his now " haunted " train found out out nevada desert engineer dead . many years later , lori girard ( daddy little fame seeking , rich girl ) finds train puts it back into shape trip copper gorge , colorado . she invites infamous guests train find out what happened jake hurley where his mine using clues jake left train . pretty simple treasure story ( this series often uses story but different ways ) now turned into intriguing mystery , good work her interactive . game also some side mysteries like lori getting kidnapped someone throwing emergency brake(both happen publicity stunts ) . but you find who those things only minutes after each event happened . what i didn't like there not really culprit because there no crime committed . very end when crime attempted after you find out who culprit . jake hurley part plot fantastic but sub-plot(s ) weren't very exciting . ****-charactersi loved characters , but you couldn't really interact them much . lori girard one my favorite characters , i loved watching dumb blonde trying get publicity how she always kept forgetting nancy name . since lori hostess she probably main character . tino baldcucci great character well . he private investigator but all he really get such fame right place right time . he conceited lori , you'll probably interact him lot more than john grey . john grey first black male this series , he host ghost hunters , cable show verge cancellation ghosts . he pretty good character but not leading role unfortunately . then there charleena purcell romance novelist introduced nancy drew : secret shadow ranch ( 10 ) , who nice very smart . she process making her book that deadline , who you'll find out used one lori story ideas her latest book without permission . i like her better now then when she nd 10 , bad she no memory game . finally there frank joe hardy . these teenage brothers work american teens against crime ( atac ) who invited because their dad friends lori dad . boys nice enough invite nancy well . i personally liked this addition game because you get play frank short-order cook . they really don't much case , they just good source info . i am looking forward playing them more nancy drew : creature kapu cave ( 15 ) . i really didn't like how there not lot character interaction this game . but when you interact times it really fun . that something add nd 16 beyond . ****-setting graphicsi love train , feel so exciting . seeing scenery pass windows great . cars so detailed beautiful . i think my favorite place train projection car . later you stop copper gorge , little town colorado . there mysterious crypt museum/taffy shop cheesy but enjoyable . crypt small there wasn't much , but i mean real life all you crypts mourn . graphics great . very realistic . its amazing how much graphics this series keeps getting better better . this probably most unique setting series . i personally love trains , boats planes so this made me really happy . *****-puzzles/activitiesthe puzzles fairly easy . i liked how lot puzzles combined into one find where jake mine . what disappointing repetition puzzles . there four or five pipe sets you connect which got little annoying . you also retrieve lot items like gemstones , tools , duct tape , pen other stuff . i don't understand how they made finding gemstones easier than playing almost impossible game tino get simple pen . some puzzles unique , like camille doll sorting puzzle her favorite dance step , playing " camptown races " piano , using metal slugs mathematical way open doors scale . but some these activities needed no skill all like combinations , word search , two memory games . this game variety but also repeated some puzzles well which brought down its score . ***-endingonce you find out where jake mine your sent off there get head start " treasure " . you'd think after all puzzles you went through you would think finding treasure mine would somewhat harder than everything else . you open entrance , memorize couple things , follow some lizards then use info you memorized . not difficult if you smart . then you find " treasure " your so called " culprit " . you wouldn't know this person culprit when he/she finds you mine talks you , but then he/she loses trust you you get caved . then you get out(i thought this fun , felt like roller coaster ) stop " culprit " . i liked ending what treasure but getting through out mine relatively easy . although culprit kind obvious , i liked what culprit plan or goal . overall it good ending yet little easier than i thought it should . ****-overallthis one better nancy drew games out there . definitely one add your shelf . flaws this game don't affect game much they could if setting different . plot pretty good most puzzles fit into it . i enjoyed this game lot after i played it more than two times . i think any game needs played more than two times get full experience . some parts game really exciting compared other parts . repetition some puzzles isn't too bad . this game outstanding but there never going best nancy drew game . it really depends your opinion . add all these up divide 6 ... 4 *' ( gameplay interface)4 *' ( plot)4 *' ( characters)5 *' ( setting graphics)3 *' ( puzzles)4 *' ( ending) = 24 stars divide 6 ( categories ) = 4 starsthanks reading	-1

im quite sure your mom probally her eye ds , especially release ds lite games like brain age your mother would want . but i am also sure your mom may not like white color , well that good , becausse coral pink ds make it more fashionable girls , well maybe even attract few guys well ( no , i am not gay , steorotypical or homophobic ) . i say people who first bashed ds , this what you get talking crap . it might astonishing sony getting their butts kicked , after all , ps2 destroyed gamecube terms sales ( same thing ps n64 ) , but some people just don't get psp . that fine , but i like my psp better , basically because my favorite genre racing . ds dosen't lumines or gta . or locoroco , so so . but then again , ds mario , magnetica , whatever . it all depends what you like best most , but since i am no fanboy or like videogames all far reaches galaxy , i enjoy each every system . now system . you know you not want bored tedious details how everythng better all other stuff you basically don't need , but this system ideal even people who original ds . if you like ds , this system update actuallly worth it . stylus way bigger , it certainly looks better , it easier play , better design , better system general . sure , you could say you don't need it , but that fine . although some people ( especially nintedno fans ) , they just can't live without it would definitly take it . myself included , i got one very soon , also , i give props nintendo making sure enough there go around everybody . i white one , but it still same great system , although you would probally choose which color you want . short , don't feel guilty if you shell out 100 bucks , it really worth it . if you don't it , it worth it , you get all kinds cool stuff this fall , includes web browser . so far though , europe gett ing it before us	1

this great controller . especially after all complaints microsoft got its original controller too bulky(personally speaking i never really problems even ) . but since i got xbox controller , i havent touched big one . this controller gives better grip , buttons softer their positioning better(the overall feel quite good ) . i played rallisport challenge this controller beat whole game . even game like rallisport where precision required accelaration braking successsfully master tracks , i it without any problems using this controller . also vibration feel very good . so if you looking buy xbox controller not able decide which , just go this smaller one , controller without any hesitation . quality hardware	1
