it not just this film bloated remake quick , clean , near-perfect minimalist thriller . it not much added material ( particularly internal affairs sub-plot ) feels tacked-on unnecessary . it not even pacino character toned-down shell dangerously off-kilter detective original , one more complicated characters ( frya selmer/tanya francke ) reduced down set dressing , or ending ruins film moral atmosphere . it fact nolan , sublimely talented director , unable coax believable performance any his leads . pacino method-acting bit again , taking it over top every single scene ; hilary swank plays pale imitation her better roles down-to-earth hometown girl ; robin williams -- well , he robin williams . kids this film , katharine isabelle jonathan jackson , turn fine performances , while hardly career-makers ( which they couldn't , considering how far their roles pared down ) , refreshing change pace their adult contemporaries ' mugging . see film their far-too-short performances , but make sure you rent it , don't pay too much so	-1
i very disappointed . acting principles fine , but i think only thing saved this movie me choreography bob fosse . i think what really turned me off omission few great songs . following tunes original show left out - near you , we've got think game , man doesn't know . applegate tune , good old days , abridged . new tune , there something empty chair , added replace near you , but it very weak . i wish someone would remake this wonderful show they've recently music man bye bye birdie	-1
almost unbelievably bad , except i saw remake ' shaft , ' which should forewarning . this like comic book filmgoers . no , not graphic novel adapted screen . more like comic book kids , you'd embarassed own any age . doubly offensive high quality soul music soundtrack , travesty nth degree .	-1
enjoyed lost translation , i thought i might like this one , which seems some sort cult reputation -- why i can't fathom . entire plot self-serving , shallow , unrealistic . i guess it supposed depict horror repressive religious values , while i don't condone those , film lacks clear characters or any motivation . lot people buttoned up parents who don't get it , it doesn't mean they kill themselves -- because they grounded !? since writer-director gerw up hollywood , she may not aware you can't keep your kid home school without very good reason -- social workers what not come after you . so entire premise false . romanticizing mass suicide bunch soft focus young blondes it -- after which they supposedly ascend erotic eternity imaginations their boyish peers -- could actually encourage act . it not caring , not real , not responsible . but i guess wouldn't bother rich , overfunded daughter hollywood genius out make name herself .	-1
this extremely dry anime . manga version masamune shirow filled bits humor . not so anime . character batou especially funny manga , but , reasons unknown , he driest character already humorless anime version . expect long scenes filled monotonous talking . these really make movie crawl . one minute there action , next you're listening matoko or batou go existentialism . seriously , these little talks , take up 3/4 movie . visuals awesome , no question . even so , they not fulfill need some kind thread story . altogether , not much actually , happens during movie . if you must see it , rent it first sure you want it	-1

if " suspense " filmed played woods , it didn't actually contain any suspense , would bear watch it ? previous sentence makes much suspense reason behind making " domestic disturbance " , newest `thriller ' starring john travolta , vince vaughn teri polo . let talk few minutes mr. travolta . anyone name actor who received more chances his career squandered them ? i think travolta now surpassed richard dreyfuss comeback/ lose it again king . after brilliant comeback engineered his longtime admirer quentin tarantino " pulp fiction " , travolta appeared number films interesting proved interesting choices . " face/off " " broken arrow " highlighted string hits ultimately allowed travolta join $20 million club . last few years , every film travolta appeared failed miserably . " lucky numbers " ? " general daughter " ? film hit but anyone even remember one significant scene it ? " swordfish " ? interesting , but flop . " battlefield earth " ? why he keep making this trash ? it paychecks . i can't see any other conceivable reason . john , baby , how long before studios realize these films aren't making any money they stop hiring you ? john , baby , how long before you need comeback vehicle ? frank morrison ( john travolta ) divorced father who makes wooden boats . he doesn't get lot business , but business he get gets great deal . he doesn't charge his customers enough make profit . frank this because he good guy . his son , danny ( matthew o'leary ) lot problems accepting his mom ( teri polo ) new relationship rick barnes ( vince vaughn ) . he gets into lot trouble lies everyone . couple days after his mom rick get married , he stows away rick car witnesses him murdering business associate . police don't believe him however . after little soul searching , frank believes his son . he may lie everyone , but he doesn't lie frank . directed harold becker ( " sea love " ) , " domestic disturbance " suspense film without any suspense . moment danny stows away rick car watches him murder ray ( steve buscemi ) , which we also watch , we know who good guy who bad guy . make matters worse , frank instantly believes his son , which means film boils down cat mouse game frank rick . boring cat mouse game . when you know identity villain , huge percentage suspense flushed down toilet . when frank believes danny early , rest suspense flushed down it . film would've greatly improved showing danny backseat car , watching everything , pain suspense registering his face , while audience sees nothing . then , when danny tries convince his dad , police chief , his mom , rick murderer , least we haven't seen act , we would require some convincing well . because filmmakers chose show us everything , next logical step provide some suspense would frank doubt danny , his son . however , after very brief segment , frank believes danny , causing us watch battle frank rick , which isn't very interesting . each actors , including travolta , serviceable their roles , but because film robs us just everything first fifteen minutes , remaining ninety become exercise tedium . skip " domestic disturbance " . it isn't even worthy video rental . go see far superior very different " amelie " or " man who wasn't there " . your money much better spent .	-1

i too bought this vhs vincent d'onofrio . my only negative comment his performance there not enough it ! i'll say right here now i'm not big fan smits or scacchi , d'onofrio overpowers them every time he screen . it beautiful story , i see why director gillian armstrong attracted it - it love story bit real-life depth ( rather than those soapy ones where ridiculous problems created characters lack imagination - julia roberts films , anyone ? ) . said , two lead roles needed played stronger actors , ones could keep up d'onofrio vivacity . worth look fans	-1

let just honest : this film terrible . . . not way " attack killer tomatoes ! " so " terrible " it great . . . more like way " caddyshack ii " so terrible director should forever live shame . . . i kid when this film released . , while it not particularly exciting then , it insanely tedious now . it genuine test patience . . . but no pay-off what-so-ever . here some potentially helpful information : slasher film branch two directions : supernatural ( friday 13th ii , halloween , nightmare elm street etc ... ) crime/revenge ( i spit your grave , friday 13th , tcm , scream , urban legend ect ... ) . this one falls under latter heading . while realism render more potent effect ( " this could really happen ! " ) , this film simply fails engage viewer any level . goal slasher film two-fold : horrify repulse . this neither !! " horror " element non-existent : there no point expounding , since there nothing examine . , if you love gore ( who doesn't ? ) try film . " murders " barely visible ( literally ) so sloppy they solicit no response other than yawn . many film problems technical : cinematography just horrendous . entirely film extremely underlit , colors needlessly washed-out , film stock grade " . " this , you know , not because film over twenty-five years old . . . problem always there . there one " good " moment entire film . . . when school " bad boy " his head lopped-off it clumsily thunks down prom-court walk-way . still , it more comic-relief than genuine horror . soundtrack could not worse . i am not referring disco tunes ( we accept those since this film made end disco period ) , but tracks made film . . . they sound like they squeaked-out carpenters . so , imagine lots disco punctuated lackluster , psuedo-thoughtful ballads ( like final song track ) . words cannot explain how wildly offensive it !! i mention leslie nielson meaty role ( yes , leslie nielsen airplane , naked gun) ? he plays tough-minded principal who tormented death his daughter . i know , it sounds funny , but it not !! trust me !! if you dig watching unattractive teenagers " disco night away , " hey , this film totally you !! but if you looking decent slasher film early middle-period its reign look elsewhere ( like halloween , friday 13th etc ... ) i'd willing get all ed mcmahon star-search you give this " film " 1/4 star . but it important milestone slasher sub-genre ( i not spoil film tell you why , though ) . so if you slasher enthusiast or horror scholar , watch it . . . picture-in-picture . . . maybe after few drinks . . . day when cable out . . . fast-forward !	-1

this movie may not everyone , but me it highly memorable . possible spoiler alert : this isn't your ordinary " travel back time alter futures people you care " -flick ( back future -- although , granted , it better made more entertaining ) . butterfly effect really ( alphabetical order ) acceptance , chance , charity , choice , grownup love , hope , identity , opportunity , regret , sacrifice . some reviewers mentioned quality acting . here my thoughts : kutcher me always seemed innocent , caring , small town fellow more than fun guy most us might know him , that why i wasn't surprised see him pull off this role . amy smart good mostly , but glaringly off-key times ( granted she show more range other actors )	-1

if you fan horror movies , old ec comic books , stephen king , or just fun movies general , than look no further than this 1982 classic ! = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = movie ( 5/5 ): " creepshow " anthology scary stories -- five them -- bridged together sixth tale boy who loves horror comics his abusive dad who hates them . movie features pitch-perfect performances all-star 80 cast seems lot fun this scream movie . stories follow : 1 . " father day " ( 4.5 /5)stars carrie nye , ed harris , viveca lindfors . easily cheesiest five stories ( but still lot fun ) , father day tells tale family reunion hell when long-dead dad rises grave his " caaaaaaakkeeeee " ( little good old fashioned zombie revenge ) . 2 . " lonesome death jordy verrill " ( 4/5)stars stephen king . although its easily weakest stories , it probably also most original , so keep your finger off fast-forward button . stephen king (!) gives nutty throughly enjoyable performance country bumpkin who battles alien plantlife meteroite touches down his backyard . sounds weird ? you don't know half it . 3 . " something tide you over " ( 5/5)stars leslie nielsen , ted danson , gaylen ross . this segment legendary . leslie nielsen gives performance his life psychotically jealous husband who takes notion bury his wife her lover neck-deep sand before tide rolls . needless say , love more powerful than death , our antihero soon finds himself neck deep terrifying troubles his own . 4 . " crate " ( 5/5)stars hal holbrook , adrienne barbeau , fritz weaver . hands down best tale terror , it no wonder three main actors this single story also receive top billing picture opening credits . this epic blood-soaked tale insanity , fear , fidelity timeless classic excellent performances all around , unforgettable monkey-like demon special effects master tom savini . longest segment film , " crate " tells story henry ( holbrook ) , college professor unbelievably obnoxious domineering wife ( brilliant performance barbeau ) . when henry colleague dexter stanley ( weaver ) discovers flesh-eating monster under stairway under stairs college informs henry , henpecked husband makes plans use monster his own domestic advantage . this out-of-this-world premise carries very real themes love death , friends family , moral responsibility versus personal hapiness . subtle undertones just hint depth this brilliantly written horror masterpiece , stephen king never more entertaining than this perfectly crafted tale . 5 . " they're creeping up you " ( 4.5 /5)stars e.g. marshall . bringing us back down soft landing , romero king conclude their horror anthology this wonderfully bizarre tale millionaire hypochondriac whose allegedly germ-proof apartment overwhelmed army cockroaches . this one goes way over top , but it all keeps tempo movie . if you know somebody who deathly afraid bugs , try showing them final scene this segment , then sit back enjoy their screams bewilderment . all all , i'd say creepshow one top three horror films ever made . rent it or buy it today ! = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = disc ( 1/5 ): unfortunately , " geniuses " over warner bros . insulted this fine film its fans offering up very lame disc . picture quality only passable , letterbox formatting kind funky , there absolutely no extras , save trailer , which i don't really count real feature . only good thing i possibly say disc it got 41 chapters , but only 21 those accesible disc . while we'll wait " creepshow " get same special edition treatment its inferior sequel , this bare bones disc only goes show strength film fact even no bonuses all , " creepshow " still one most rewatchable indispensable horror movies market	1

why record company would put this out vhs , not dvd , beyond me , especially considering its release date . ultimate would ( they it before , see both doors sepultura dvd releases ) take this , add it , live brixton , put it all one dvd . since this doesn't seem likely , i suggest , burn your own dvd , include not only " ricochet " " bloody murder " ( both left out ) , but also mr. bungle one music video release . happily , while " stripsearch " not listed back vhs box , it included . fnm videos ? great , great , great ..	1

price this bit steep , especially since bonus materials limited ( though enjoyable ) . nonetheless , i didn't regret spending money . maysles brothers such amazing groundbreaking documentarians anything theirs you get your hands worth it . this film follows four very ordinary bible salesmen late 1960 they ply their trade cold snow new england then sunshine florida . maysles ' focus particular one gentleman who clearly not cut out this work slowly but surely headed scrap pile . despite relative mundanity events , you find yourself transfixed these men endure high-powered mindwashing their superiors struggle survive dying industry . few films ever so poignantly made point , though god may good box office , no one really seems give damn who buys or sells tickets show	1

" grave fireflies " one hardest-watching movies i've ever seen , one i wouldn't missed world . taking place japan during latter parts world war ii ( though it could any country any war ) , it story two children , seita setsuko , who left their own when their mother dies destruction small town , left attempt survive their own . seita , brother , older two it falls him guard care his sister setsuko , who little more than toddler . two hold out hope their father , member japanese navy , eventually return them . seita setsuko wonderful captivating characters who seem uncannily real , making their plight all more terrifying heartbreaking . what perhaps most horrifying whole experience not just brutalities war , because expected ; but terribly callous nature many ' ordinary people ' children encounter during their ordeal . during darkest days war , when logically one would think survivors would pulling together , case often anything but . even family setsuko seita mother not want ' burdened ' them . although examples people who react differently crop up later , bulk time children their own ruin befalls world around them . children , fireflies setsuko finds , keeps jar , talking them feeding them , releasing them night fly makeshift shelter seita constructed . abandoned humanity , little glowing insects only living creatures children find companionship . there bright tender , even humorous , moments amidst tragedy - some them overt , others occur places where meaning subject interpretation . but it remains harrowing movie , one most crushing ever made . extremely haunting , extremely powerful , , odd way , extremely rewarding . there glimmers whispers possibility flitting , firefly-like , through darkness , effect truly eerie . i'll refrain hinting ending , but there certainly host moments sear themselves into one heart . if this movie doesn't leave you shaken , nothing ever going	1
i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1

i agree- they don't make ' em like this anymore- honest , bold , uncompromising , socially politically meaningful ... yet ( lest we forget ) entertaining . like stanley kubrick , late hal ashby didn't direct whole lot films , but most them built last ( quot ; harold amp ; maudequot ; , quot ; last detailquot ; , quot ; therequot ; , quot ; shampooquot ;) . quot ; landlordquot ; ashby impressive directorial debut 1970 . spoiled rich kid beau bridges , worrisome his parents due his quot ; liberal viewsquot ; , buys run-down tenement building intentions rennovate . his introduction , subsequent involvement , various black tenants played sometimes laughs , sometimes intense drama , but always real , that magic ashby work . social satire dead-on , but never preachy ( you listening , spike lee ? ) . ensemble work top-notch , young lou gossett ( hair ! ) giving memorable dramatic turn , lovely susan anspach hilarious bridges ' perpetually stoned bemused sister . scene which pearl bailey lee grant ( two more knockout performances ) get drunk bond over bottle quot ; sparklingquot ; wine minor classic all its own . don't miss this one	1

this movie wonderful . although it didn't exactly make me cry , it touch me sentimental way . i fell love morrie . he such sweet guy , his story inspiration everyone . i greatly impressed how he chose make most his life , even though fate handed him death sentence . he made up his mind he wasn't going sit around feel sorry himself ; he going make his final days happy pleasant entirely possible , i really admire . i also pleased effect morrie his old college student , mitch . mitch learns appreciate life little surprises , not such big rush all time . he learns relax smell roses , let go old grudges , value people his life , he even learns allow himself cry . my most favorite scene where mitch actually breaks down bawls , morrie takes him his arms two men embrace each other . this scene without doubt most moving one entire film . although it last time mitch ever sees morrie alive , it still very sweet poignant . ending pretty sad , but it also happy same time . morrie gone , yet his legacy lives . i recommend this movie anyone , any gender , any age .	-1

this one my favorite movies . besides containing stellar cast ( matthew mcconaughey , sandra bullock , sammuel . jackson , oliver platt , donald keifer sutherland , kevin spacey ) you get idea . there cast member isn't biggie ? casting genious , acting incredible . it suspenseful , deep , very emotional .. slightly dark .. it perfect movie . even rape scene well comfortably vague while still haunting you . time kill plot pretty simply explained . deep south , 10 year old black girl raped two wite rednecks , who almost kill her . young white lawyer father ( matthew mcconaughey jake brigance ) sickened news , doesn't quite know what think when little girl father ( sammuel . jackson carl lee hailey ) pays him visit asks if he'd " help him if he tight spot " . next day two redneck/monsters led up stairs courthouse their arraignment , carl lee hailey pops out storage clauset machine gun blows away two young men raped his daugher . jake brigance agrees defend hailey his murder trial begins . insanity plea used " give jury excuse aquit " but my opinion , i think it quite legitimate . what father wouldn't driven insane under circumstances ? rest movie carl lee hailey trial surrounding drama kkk violence emerges led kiefer sutherland , jake life home danger , his relationship his wife strained , his career seriously line what seems loosing battle . my favorite scene ? it might come surprise , but my favorite scene when prosecution calls stand policeman who leading two rednecks up stairs their trial . he caught knee stray bullet , now half leg . after prosecution use witness incite rage against carl lee , establish unerring identity shooter , defence asks him two questions . " you think carl lee intentionally shot you ? " " no " " you think he should sent prision what he ? "" he what i would . " but it doesn't end there policeman ( remember he missing leg because what carl lee hailey ) becomes very emotional boldly confesses if someone raped his little girl he would blow him away just like carl lee . he starts screaming jury " turn him loose , he hero ! " i think this one most emotion packed well acted scenes ( albeit there many others too ) ( great acting chris cooper policeman ) anyway .. forgive if i rambled . i love this movie if you like courtroom dramas ... star studded casts .. john grisham ... suspense thrillers .. just all around good movies .. you need see this .	1
this movie such wonderful reviews both professional critics amazon customers i expecting great things . while i agree acting ( especially girls playing christy ariel ) excellent story just too implausible i got impression minute we see family crossing canada us ( yes they irish but some reason they sneak us canada ) . anyway why earth would apparently intelligent couple enter us their two kids illegally , without jobs or much money settle most expensive city country ? i know dad actor but couldn't he settled family one less expensive boroughs taken subway manhattan ? mom teacher but can't find job but no wonder if they country illegally . yet there money private school , fixing up dump apartment , expensive camcorder , betting rent money et doll etc . i can't imagine any parents moving apartment building known " drug house " two young girls then letting girls wander they please . mind you parents couple supposedly almost crippled guilt they feel over third child - son - recently died . i kept expecting someone call social services . medical situations both frankie mom new baby not well thought out or researched . symbolism mateo , new baby frankie very heavy handed . though film told through oldest daughter eyes because several scenes elements movie not suited all children . there also several scenes really not connected oldest daughter all . maybe if i taken it more fable i would " gotten " this movie more but i expecting straight forward drama disappointed .	-1

bit campy spots , bit ahead its time others , westworld looms potential goldmine trilogy-happy hollywood . introduce all-star cast beginning , split them up three different worlds , end first film characters escaping their grisly fate ... only find themselves medieval world . repeat formula second part , adding characters who went off park , then shunt survivors off join rest roman world big third film finale . seriously , why somebody not making this already	-1
i think this movie , although depressing , good example survival instinct manifested children . maybe some sort perverted way i thought these children would become expert ways survival , this experience could positive their lives they got older . these kids knoked around early life this , hopefully , would only make them stronger granting them true picture reality dog eat dog lifestyle capitalism . these kids model capitalist system encourages rugged darwinian individualism . part me wishes i would spent few years street like these kids ( sans aurolac if possible ) . if anything we should admire these children their incredible innocent strength ... this urban primitivism liberty its best especially when contrasted those fat ugly pampered bucharetians chillin ' sydney cafe ...	1

jack ryan , hero several tom clancy novels , back it this movie terrorism global nuclear war . 1973 , during arab-israeli war , lone israeli pilot took off flew toward arab lines . his cargo : one nuclear bomb . however , plane shot down , but somehow , bomb survived . it soon buried sand left unnoticed twenty-nine years . meanwhile , trouble occuring other parts world well . president russia mysteriously dies , new president , nemerov , ( ciaran hinds ) takes power . this move alerts american cia , especially director william cabot ( morgan freeman ) . nemerov known wild card , many unsure his motives . however , jack ryan ( ben affleck ) isn't convinced nemerov . ryan wrote paper nemerov , he seems think he more conservative his views . directed president robert fowler ( james cromwell ) , cabot ryan sent russia check status their nuclear disarmament . once there , they given tour russian nuclear assembly plant . many renowned russian scientists work there . however , three mysteriously disappeared . back middle east , two men managed dig up remains missing nuclear bomb . they sell them man named olson ( colm feore ) , who pays mere [ ... ] bomb . immediately , wheels set motion . three missing russian scientists olson devised plan construct their own nuclear bomb , smuggle it back into united states , detonate it super bowl . detonation would lead united states believe , due instability russian government under nemerov , russians would blamed detonation . both united states russia would destroy each other while scientists olson sat watched . however , ryan manages put all pieces together his way baltimore when bomb detonated . huge mushroom cloud covers city , many people killed . expected , president fowler immediately suspects russians blame immediately orders counter-strike . thus begins tense game international chess ; who blink first ? ryan arrive time stop world war iii , or he too late ? i found this very exciting entertaining movie . story thrilling very well-conceived . special effects very good well . attack american aircraft carrier one my favorite sequences film . morgan freeman , ben affleck , james cromwell give fine performances . although i appreciated affleck effort , i still think alec baldwin ( " hunt red october " ) harrison ford ( " patriot games " ) better job jack ryan . i recommend this very good movie . although i haven't read book yet , i plan soon see how well movie compares it . if you're fan techno-thrillers , then don't miss this one	-1

my 12th grade government teacher showed our class this film , we all hooked . if you ever room thirty some teenagers , you know its hard get their attention keep them quiet . so really , if bunch teenagers enjoyed this movie , everyone should consider giving it chance . it might not action packed some movies out today , such 16 blocks , but it gonna keep your attention , so yourself favor atleast rent it , you might find yourself coming back buy it	1
i'm glad someone knows enough english history recognize pure fiction this film . but addition points made historical inaccuracy , i also object ridiculous portrayal mary tudor . over-zealous fanatic ( common religious stance those times - promoted both sides protestant/catholic conflict ) , she not insane film makes her opening scenes . throughout film , there this emphasis milking passions all they worth - no objectivity whatsoever . i sorely disappointed ! if you want get know elizabeth period which she lived , i would recommend superb bbc series , elizabeth glenda jackson . if you want even further background , look bbc again six wives henry viii keith mitchell . tidbits gained well movie mary , queen scots ( although few historical inaccuracies found it - example , mary stuart elizabeth never met , although it mary great desire ) even title , anne thousand days . those two more theatrical representations fulfill desire more dramatic while still coming closer history times . this film just doesn't cut it	-1

all these bad reviews confuse movie they didn't like badly made movie . this very well made movie , perfectly competent performances . tone quite serious , ending won't cheer anyone up . but then there many people who loved titanic , which i found utterly depressing . more point , though , who cares problems these rich kids ? not me . real reason watch this see molly ringwald her most beautiful . if you enjoy this film , check out less than zero , gloomy but solid ( underrated ) ' 80s film . worst ' 80s film bright lights , big city - don't say i didn't warn you !	1
dated , derivative , self-indulgent unintelligent . this truly bottom range stuff . acting , directing , soundtrack script all dire . none characters even remotely sympathetic , fact i hoping they'd die slowly painfully . i note billy bob thornton both star scriptwriter - methinks his true nature revealed script part he chose - arrogant , amoral , misogynistic , self-important coward ( zero sense humour ) . don't waste your time watching this drivel , it leave you bad taste your mouth no amount tequila erase .	-1
this first disc all editions this movie dvd includes making-of featurette should more than please casual fan film . second disc , exclusive special edition , goes deeper into just every aspect production , i just wish they'd lower amount mutual " pats back " " tom all his stunts " bit . i guess my favorite " mission " would first but all them great things going them . action films go , they really belong top crop . best thing going mi3 ethan hunt supporting team which once work together way they used old series . i hard time understanding cold shoulder audiences given tom cruise over his couch-jumping thing , sure , it hard getting excited hollywood star wanting marry third time but celebrities go nowadays , it not even worth mentioning it . this reminds me time when james cameron joked " king world " after winning oscar people becoming bitter towards him . i guess some people don't like see others too happy their lives . if cruise follows some religion which some us sounds more than bit loony , least he hasn't anything attack mine like all those involved da vinci code . any rate , don't let mediocre box office results mi3 discourage you watching it . you see real effort make outstanding film every scene	1
one best documentries its genre ; " paradise lost " willkeep you rivited till end . then it not over - cause you start thinking what you seen wonder what fact really happened . i know loads people firmly believe innocence wm3 , i wholeheartedly support retrail . but , never i wished more something like " time machine " - so one go back history this incident see what truth ; see what really took place there . we must guard against notion wm3 without any blame , keep mind they troubled backgrounds . i firmly believe someone like damien dabble various cults unsavoury influences , i thought it mistake try deny outright . instance , i don't believe one moment rebellious teenager would change his name damien honour some priest who lived amongst lepers . just doesnt ring true . maybe their undoing - try paint them misunderstood ( totally ) spotless youngsters . but please , i am not implying they guilty . not least . you watch paradise lost 2 , once you seen this one , it compelling follow-up this tragic story	-1

i first saw this film when i thirteen - perhaps even younger , i recall seeing it black white . thirty years , propelled memories which still stuck my mind , i bought this disk america ( it not released uk where i live ) . seeing again through adult eyes , one notices joins - songs which not really work , occasional twee touch . but what film ! presented marvellous technicolour , cast which takes script seriously not go over top unnecessarily , thus bringing dr seuss amazing ( freudian ? )dream/fantasy life . this not epic . it intimate film , which talks you rather than throwing endless special effects you stave off your boredom . ( it also nothing like recent live action ' cat hat'which some consider worst film ever . ) it reminds us gulf adults children , dr seuss reminds us sometimes adults see through children eyes see truth . but it also lets adults their say well . this ultimately film its time ( early 50s ) but it film which takes its chances doesn't play safe . it film which strange , dreamlike - worth taking your hear t.t hirty years , i'm glad i . why not try it ? - you might too	1
i purchase lot dvds . past few years , it seems almost every dvd comes special edition two-disc release includes deleted scenes , documentaries , cast bios , trailers , teaser trailers , music videos , director recipe three-alarm chili . i usually don't time get beyond first disc , much what i get around usually turns out boring it gets . this time , however , i am happy report two-disc anniversary release philadelphia worth both money time invested it , even if you already philadelphia dvd . special features include 84-minute documentary , one foot banana peel other grave , extraordinary piece amateur filmmaking aids patient named juan botas . what i not know mr. botas ' aids diagnosis provided inspiration director jonathan demme make philadelphia first place , mr. botas best friends mr. demme wife . meanwhile , mr. botas mentioned filmmaker demme it shame black humor , amazing courage other interesting dialogue emanated his fellow patients clinic where he treated lost forever it left their lips . mr. demme gave mr. botas his hand-held camera , results so impressed demme he wound up releasing documentary through his own production company . finished film touching , oddly comic , tragic effecting any piece drama you've ever witnessed . one patients doctor office also given few lines main feature , philadelphia . which brings us film . time its release , philadelphia received some very harsh criticism aids community its perceived flaws ; it judged many " too hollywood " realistically representative hiv / aids experience . their credit , background documentary included here , " people like us " ( which original working title philadelphia ) creative team behind philadelphia ( including jonathan demme , tom hanks screenwriter ron nyswaner ) meet this criticism head , presenting defense their work both credible illuminating . many complained philadelphia void any tenderness or physical contact male couple ( hanks bandaras ) but this not only redressed closer look their scenes together , extremely intimate scene lovers bed ( which excised final cut ) deleted not its controversy but because scene simply didn't work ( now seen it , i attest this fact ) . i long seen this movie not film aids per se , but film homophobia . indeed , main thrust plot ( besides trial ) transformation character joe miller committed homophobe more enlightened tolerant person . one my favorite scenes ( which it turns out many people wanted delete final cut ) deals subtly millers transformation - " opera scene " . scene , miller asked character or andy what he thinks gay people . attorney responds , when straight people think them all , most straight people pretty much see all gay people some sort sub-human predatory monsters , out ensnare children world into twisted sick life , destroy all straight people hold dear . andy abruptly changes subject , " you like opera , joe ? " he asks . caught surprise , joe admits he not know anything it - andy beckett - this sub-human destroyer children , responds tenderly passionately explaining his deep love beautiful music allowing joe see just small piece exactly why so many gay men love opera . he plays aria la mama morte , carefully , passionately articulately explaining story beauty behind words music . joe immediately transformed - it clear he deeply moved . playing piece , la mama morte through again its entirety , screenwriter director shows us music stayed joe long after he left andy home . we see him leave andy apartment go home sort daze , kiss his sleeping baby slip into bed his slumbering wife , while beauty music haunts caresses him , like gorgeous gay lullaby . some my gay friends among those who didn't get this scene - they saw it only stereotypical depiction gay man love opera . i got it right away - exposing joe thing beauty he'd never experienced before , andy suddenly allowed joe consider gay men not only something more than what he thought , he demonstrated we capable enormous passion ability appreciate delicate beauty . this scene , more than any other , allowed andrew beckett transformed predatory sub-human freak into human , not only joe miller , but many straight audience . it remained one my favorite scenes movie ever , small part what makes philadelphia such powerful experience . highly recommended .	1

i agree david thomson when he says few audiences west would content view american epic composed solely battles their contexts . kurosawa keen businessman his reputation west entrenched " kagemusha " " ran " , he knew what ( american ) audiences think heroic mystical " historical " japan : kurosawa art takes great deal its impetus what americans ( or westerners ) imagine japan . he not popular japan ( where they thought his stuff particularly hokey outmoded , hence suicide attempt ) . i am not saying work rubbish - there no " ugly " shot either " ran " or " kag " - merely there more " authentically japanese " films out there choose .	-1

when it comes film adaptations , most films fail some way . think japanese film director could transform one greatest plays written english language mke it his own , quite tremendous . think he could use japanese noh theater images enhance adpatation stroke genius . mifune one greatest actors play macbeth , dare say maybe best . akira kurosawa directed masterpiece proves why he top pantheon great world directors . , course , criterion collection folk out themselves , again . thank goodness them , because it wasn't them , we all would missing out great films .	1

this much more interesting visual chronicle 1982 new york ( there generous aerial views , lots location shooting , etc . ) than horror movie , even cheesy one . special effects used extremely sparingly , word " special " definite overstatement . some amusing performances somewhat redeem proceedings , but not much . end , " , winged serpent " watchable certainly not horribly bad , but it hard imagine this anybody favorite horror movie or even guilty pleasure . end positive note , dvd features clean , sharp print film .	-1
it shame this movie wasn't bigger hit -- largely because it deprived moviegoers more cinematic pairings dennis quaid ellen barkin , couple whose on-screen chemistry approached william powell myrna loy . sex scenes here truly steamy , yet used much establish character advance story titillate audience . quaid portrays casually corrupt homicide cop new orleans pd who forced rethink his life when ( ) barkin , da he seriously attracted , refuses anything him , ( ) he discovers corruption department vastly exceeds anything he ever imagined . movie may quot ; show me moneyquot ; beginning , but end , it quot ; show me remorse . quot ; plot man reformed love good woman lost popularity 20th century progressed , but quaid , barkin director jim mcbride deserve credit updating it fresh , surprising sexy way	1

premise - one could change specific events ones ' past through psychic concentration - could foundation fascinating thriller . i don't condemn film corollary either : each change produces new , unforseeable tragedies . it way story told - its ham-fisted dialogue plot , its forced obscenity every turn - reveals its teen sensibilities . it therefore fitting director preferred ending included here . it perfect catharsis teens who " ... wish i never born !	-1

rashomon ( 1950 ; directed akira kurosawa starring toshiro mifune ) one those films truly hip seen , not many others ; rather like certain books -- road , satanic verses , one hundred years solitude , naked lunch -- it certain hip cache , one cineastes all seen discuss great detail . name-droppers know they need only mention name knowledgeable context viewed awe . truth , however , rashomon sort film everyone should see ; it true classic , league casablanca , citizen kane others . film examines truth , context rape murder 12th century japan , four different perspectives ; woodcutter who witnessed whole incident yet afraid report it , bandit who committed crime , murdered man ghost ( through medium ) rape victim ( murdered man wife ) . there few elements which remain constant each version story -- murdered man tied up forced watch bandit ravish his wife , he indeed die -- but how he died varies . it either swordfight bandit , his wife hand dagger , or suicide resulting his absolutely crushed his wife choosing leave bandit . she demand his death ? he look her scorn after crime ? she really raped or she yield consensually bandit ? honesty also explored detail , wife honesty most question , but also three men sheltering rainstorm ruined gate rashomon who relate story themselves . this one late toshiro mifune ( 1920-1997 ) first collaborations akira kurosawa , his criminally-insane tajomaru masterfully acted . so effective mifune acting you truly loathe tajomaru ; you're torn pity disgust wife ( masahiko kyo , also brilliant actress ) , there truly few really sympathetic characters among cast here . camera work exemplary , shows what kurosawa best known -- unusual perspectives some truly arresting shots , proving his eye detail sharp black white it would later colour ( cf . dersu uzala , kagemusha , ran , 3 latter-day kurosawa masterpieces ) . absolutely worth seeing , proof saying there three sides every story ( wit : mine , yours , what really happened) -- but also proving what really happened isn't even ever certain	1

" sixteen candles " first film collaboration john hughes molly ringwald started very profitable franchise both ms. ringwald mr. hughes . ringwald stars samantha " sam " baker , teen who turning sixteen , unfortunately her same time her spoiled , indulged fairly shallow older sister jenny ( blanche baker ) getting married . sam wakes up her birthday , expecting her body blossom everything roses . unfortunately , her own family forgets it appears she going miserable birthday . additionally , nerdy " farmer ted " ( anthony michael hall ) developed crush sam , while sam pines away dreamy jake ryan ( michael schoeffling ) , who quite involved pampered princess caroline ( havilland morris ) . what makes this movie such staple any 80s fan not just john hughes/molly ringwald connection , but appearance anthony michael hall , john cusack ( small , but early , film role ) , unforgettable long duck dong sympathy shown sam plight . who didn't crush most unobtainable guy high school ? who didn't pine away senior , who seemed it all , including perfect girlfriend ? what girl didn't go thru high school awaiting " perfect " sixteenth birthday ? sam problems all-important her , most teens , but hughes doesn't gloss over it or make them seem trivial . he sympathizes sam plight plight teen girls everywhere , whose biggest tragedy not getting car their sixteenth birthday , or popular guy not interested them . keeping hughes ' later films , all action over course day or two , so " problems " fairly quickly resolved . perhaps not highly realistic , but more satisfactory . also not highly realistic , most teen worlds , incredibly decent moral character oh-so-popular jake ryan . would any other popular guy , upon intercepting note naming him sam biggest crush , keep himself ? would he really want dump his popular , sexually active , girlfriend because he wants more than party ? maybe not reality , but teen girl dream world , this exactly what would happen . so , ultimately , " sixteen candles " fantasy film - - fantasy teen girls everywhere 80s ate up made molly ringwald their poster girl . highly recommended nostalgic look back molly , anthony michael hall , young john cusack adorable michael schoeffling .	1

federico fellini 1972 film not his best , when he 8 1/2 , la strada la dolce vita his credit . while many critics adore this film its absurdity plotless , dreamy structure , i found it boring phantasmagorical . it simply fellini version rome not rome , eternal city itself . risk sounding negative , i shall admit there some moments which it most expressive early 1970 rome - scenes which hippies american tourists invade city , long scene outdoor restaurant where everyone talking their heads off ( though saying some pretty vulgar things ) my favorite scene- underground archaelogical excavation which frescoes old roman patricians fade into oblivion . but mostly this film weak it bored me because there no plot . it starts off alright , movie works well when there no sudden fantasy sequences . fellini himself this movie , well gore vidal . fellini envisions himself young man studying rome his youth strict catholic school ( slide/projector shows ancient monuments like colliseum , apian way , trevi fountain vatican well offensive pornographic image woman behind ) later young man journeys rome itself takes residence large family crowded apartment slum . then young man sees talent show tasteless , vulgar long-winded . i found myself just unimpressed outraged audicences went far throw dead cat stage ! it bothered me there much attention prostitution , brothels or cheap , slutty women . cover film promiscuous woman start film . film rome italy , there hardly any allusion opera or any true classical theater . pope fashion show ludicrous blasphemous . only serious , hardcore fans fellini want own this dvd . it perfect follow-up his equally absurd sexually radical satyricon , loosely based old roman epic .	1

" vendetta " interesting movie won't allow you remain indifferent . love or hate it , i'm pretty sure you opinion this polemic film , based comic written alan moore , adapted big screen wachowski brothers , directed james mcteigue . story begins england , but not england we know . mcteigue england eerily similar country orwell tells us " 1984 " . there dictator , chancellor adam sutler ( john hurt ) , chosen free elections , but afterwards decided become absolute ruler , exerting power without any kind restriction . citizens nothing , they relinquished their right participate decide , merely sheep told what what think . their freedom curtailed , but they feel safe . however someone prepared shake their certitude , make them realize things not what they seem . person ( hugo weaving ) , man willing risk everything order turn meek sheep into citizens , wreak havoc enemies destroyed his life long time ago . evey ( natalie portman ) , young woman rescues sutler minions , privileged spectator v plans , first person become fervent follower . path , though , not easy , evey new strenght forged fires prison . this highly controversial movie delves upon difficult subjects , example whether end validates means , power words . all same , " vendetta " makes you think , great actors , original cinematography hectic pace . my point view , this film simply must see . belen alca	-1

this 1971 black comedy still stitch , even if it doesn't feel audacious i'm sure it once . directed maverick hal ashby , it epitome all opposites-attract love stories twenty-year old depressive connects 79-year old life-loving woman . they actually bond over their mutual interest death , they keep showing up same funerals . however , root their respective interests couldn't more different - maude shows up reconfirm how lucky she feels alive , while hearse-driving harold simply likes morbidity it all . plot really their burgeoning relationship , while his mother constantly attempts make death-obsessed harold more socially acceptable . first , she uselessly sets him up series blind dates . foil any hope romance these women , however , he stages mock-suicides which simply perturbs rather than disturbs his mother . she then recruits ineffectual analyst even her brother victor , hawkish officer vietnam war amputee , try convince harold join army . episodic structure story collin higgins ( years before becoming director his own right " foul play " " nine five " ) allows characters develop subtle ways completely deadpan approach despite outward shenanigans characters ' actions . movie eventually moves toward greater gravitas but despite some soap opera elements , surprisingly not expense pervasive whimsical tone . ruth gordon her typically pixilated self , archetype she played years afterward , while bud cort terrific conveying his particular brand wide-eyed cynicism . it really their unforced chemistry keeps film feeling fresh 35 years later . there funny sideline performances vivian pickles harold eye-rolling mother , ellen geer overly actressy blind date named sunshine , eric christmas very funny cameo disapproving priest . cat stevens ' soundtrack hasn't aged well , say , simon garfunkel music " graduate " , but it still works folkish commentary quirky proceedings . unfortunately , 2000 dvd contains rather compromised print there no extras included	-1

thing i remember most this film when i saw it theater 1990 its honesty . every level . great care taken accurately depict one particular community one particular time -- when aids first diagnosed " gay cancer , " up through mid-eighties , when attending monthly funerals commonplace gay men their friends . though hiv/aids around decade when this movie made , there no effort part filmmakers whitewash past . they not only show ugliness disease , they show ugliness people response it . even within gay community there tendency people fingerpoint , accusing first victims more promiscuous than themselves , or more excessive users amyl nitrate recreational drugs . there fear contamination , reluctance touch or kiss , even intimacy within monogomous relationships hampered . people reached deperately new age cures , louise haye reigning goddess self-healing . choosing depict five-year period , filmmakers allow viewer see lives group friends evolve deepen . some course succumb disease die , others wrestle their losses rethink their lives . end , survivors try become part solution ; they become visiting volunteers political activists . all its authenticity , film not depressing . this incredible ensemble acting its best . campbell scott , bruce davison , mark lamos give especially moving performances , but there no slackers this cast . time movie released , face aids already changing filmmakers criticized focusing exclusively gay victims . i felt then , i continue believe , this misplaced criticism . all fiction self-limited . longtime companion story one small group friends who affected unknown dreadful disease ; it shows how each them responds challenges thrown them . yes , they wealthy or middle-class white men who spent summers together fire island . but longtime companion not celebration their insular lives . fact , end film , one this insular group , campbell scott character , shown working home care volunteer who visits latino man . i think filmmakers , like gmhc time , aware things starting change . it seems me film critics , even 1990 , forgotten aids first announced new york times " gay cancer " later " gay related immune deficiency syndrome " before called aids . but said , we need remember there many other people stories worth telling , including those people living coping aids africa . my only hope these stories told all accuracy sensitivity went into making longtime companion . dvd no significant " extras , " but transfer excellent	1

this first time i thought movie not worth seeing waited until it hit premium movie channel . this time i admit i made mistake . this movie fun watch . it well written interactions two main actors show great chemistry . nicolas cage plays special agent charge secret service detail guarding former first lady . first lady played well my shirley maclaine . agent feels he wasted such detail wants desperately get back detail white house ... first lady wants him stay . two seem thrive confrontation each other . she her best break every procedure secret service supposed follow . if you pay attention movie you see why first lady actually loves agent so much wants him her . i think picture shows us very accurate relationship occurs agent his protectee . though it could seen comedy ; there just enough drama mystery which cage character solves . very well directed perfect pace timing . i look forward buying it watching it again .	1

company , say least , unusual show . what it , really ? certainly brilliant musical , stephen sondheim . but it taken very special place broadway lore , thanks great part cast album recorded front d.a. pennebaker cameras . if you're aficionado broadway , you already know lot sondheim . so , it fascinating see young composer coaching his singers consulting recording engineers during this marathon session 1971 . it truly exciting vibrant look process , shot entirely hand-held , raw focusing close ups vocalists . performances microphones , not lenses , so you see quite few candid moments throughout evening , this gives film heightened intensity , even moreso because whole thing runs just under hour . still , if you played played cast album , it very refreshing see alternate takes shown here . dean jones emoting " alive " incredible performance you'll ever view , elaine stritch " ladies who lunch " recording lynchpin which this whole film hung . my only complaint this dvd " commentary " track . granted , this commentary track particularly well . some statements clearly scripted , like ones filmmaker pennebaker makes opening . also commenting hal prince , broadway director extraordinaire , who some interesting insights elaine , superstar diva , just her gabby self . they carefully drop comments where it doesn't take away original interview moments film , there minimum rambling , which all too typical such tracks other dvds . but fact , this commentary track should complete separate interview section , perhaps gathering few more participants , sitting them down room chat . it would chance pennebaker roll more film revisiting this alchemical moment time . ah well , there very little complain here ! if you're even mildly interested documentary filmmaking , broadway shows , cast albums or sondheim , you know what you must : get this disc ! highly recommended	-1

somewhat curiously , japanese critics not enthusiastic rashomon when it released 1950 japan . today , however , rashomon generally considered film introduced both master director akira kurosawa japanese cinema west ; it also often cited film prompted academy motion picture arts sciences create award best foreign language film . it widely regarded masterwork world cinema . set 12th century japan , film premise once both very simple very complex . man found dead forrest , several people brought forward give testimony matter . some respects their accounts agree -- but numerous others , some obvious some very subtle , their stories differ . each character gives his or her version events , various differences pile higher higher , leaving viewer wonder motivations involved . each person simply interpreted same facts different ways ? they deliberately lie order protect themselves ? differences their stories deliberate or subconcious ? film offers no easy answers . some criticized film seeming state there no such thing ultimate truth , but rashomon more complex than this : it essentially meditation our inability , it deliberate or unintentional , reach more than approximation ultimate truth due very nature humanity itself . much written look film , which indeed memorable . filmed kazuo miyagawa , it presents forrest living , breathing entity ; images powerful , editing remarkable . no less so performances , which require various actors shift behavior each person involved gives their own account event ; this particularly true toshiro mifune , frequent performer kurosawa films , actress machiko ky . but whether lead or supporting player , all performaces equally astonishing . film extremely , extremely influential over years , such it no longer quite same " shock new " it audiences 1950s ; nonetheless , this director kurosawa working very close height his power , while he would create other films equalled bested rashomon , it remains among his masterworks . criterion edition quite fine , offering near-pristine print your choice subtitles or dubbing ( former recommended ) several memorable extras . strongly recommended fans world cinema . gft , amazon reviewe	1
i find this film very interesting , though not reasons you would expect . it two male teenagers living working class neighborhood london , who one day discover they attracted each other . one them not even aware he might gay ( ste , popular athlete ) . put this way , it may sound like your typical coming age gay story . but it much more than . what makes this movie really special supporting cast . they carry weight story . character played linda henry ( sandra , jamie mother ) truly fascinating , her performance astounding . leah deserves film just herself . also soundtrack mama cas mamas papas standout . i think both gay straight audiences enjoy this excellent film	-1

supercomputer takes over world , eh ? sounds like rather unbelievable plot , except this movie they make it believable . , if you believe they'd make computer first place controls all nuclear bombs u.s. , which i very hard time believing most people who make war machines would install some kind manual safety . this movie starts out optimistic which makes it bit dull start , but halfway through it becomes very intense . ending very chilling , makes me wish there couple hours . i give it 4 stars because it bit slow predictable start , but it builds builds until end scares pants right you	-1
this film absolutely hot !! film so full erotic tension , even when there ' nothing actually happening ' (!) . , erotic appeal , i give it 5 stars , even though story gets bit unsatisfactory towards end . it feels like it originally different some essential scenes cut . but i can't say much more without giving too much away . i love very ending , though ! calls sequel , really , which unfortunately never happened . i would loved see robert patrick more steamy action ... so , if you want see two very good-looking people involved loads hot situations talking - this film get . might story bit confused - but who cares ??? it certainly not boring	1
this film long one my top ten favorites quality acting screenplay , importance theme : secret network could operate within intelligence community beneath radar legitimate agency oversight . film seems especially prescient now , given fictional network goal planning u.s. invasion mideast . voila , 30 years later , u.s. invaded mideast . when redford character finally confronts rogue c.i.a. leader plan , he connects dots says , " this whole damn thing oil , isn't it ? " exactly . let clear why u.s. armed forces iraq , rather than , say , ecuador or nepal : it strategic importance region oil . yes , plan transform iraq into democratic nation , which lead entire region direction . but u.s. isn't committing its treasure citizenry all troubled regions globe equally ; we iraq because it strategic linchpin region . without access mideast oil reserves , world economy would shaken its foundations . there many troubled , undemocratic regions world -- example , much africa ; yet we fight now establish democracy only one troubled region , mideast . coincidence ? no . simple self-interest . cliff robertson character says film conclusion : " when people cold their engines stop running , they're not going ask us why ; they'll just want us go get it . " realizing he embarrassment c.i.a. ( inevitable role any whistleblower , even reluctant one ) , film end redford gives entire story new york times . robertson character , c.i.a. station chief who caught off-guard hidden conspiracy , says , " but they print it ? " redford taken aback implication -- government could pressure media suppress story -- then he avers , less confidently , " they'll print it . " this core democracy : free press keeps government answerable its people . without free skeptical press , all elections world mean nothing .	1

considering sensational cast ( eli wallach , terrence hill , bud spencer , kevin mccarthy brock peters ) , euro-western era it made locations where it shot , ace high major disappointment . plot uninvolving incoherent , cinematography cramped completely lacking style , music weak during time spawned so many memorable soundtracks direction lacks any focus whatsoever . editing looks like it performed butcher knife . after first ten minutes , i knew i'd made mistake buying it . boring 120 minute piece junk , ace high hopelessly outgunned any number great italian westerns including corbucci mercenary or parolini sabata series . save your fistful dollars better film	-1

some medical information very helpful . my recommendation this not book someone under 35 , it not book someone who already hysterectomy , nor it someone who young children home . her hormonal theory , menopause time life when we look beyond nurturing our families , look nurturing ourselves instead slightly flawed . many women hysterectomies or other forms induced menopause very early age . i think my total hysterectomy 34 ( obvious onset menopause ) changed my ability or desire nurture my children ? course not . that ridiculous , if i think it too much , it actually offensive . her comments marriage questionable , well . marriages sustain many changes , menopause just one them . open lines communication , deep love commitment certainly enough weather " hormonal storm . " how sad it seems if one point book menopause time assess your marriage . shouldn't we doing every day , re-committing ourselves growing together ? many reviewers commented some her more non-traditional methods . i am not fan tarot cards , i'm not sure how i feel taking medical advice someone who diagnosed herself several occassions , using them . that just my own opinion . i tried look beyond . i just think this book written people older than i am . that okay , but it still leaves me looking something i truly relate	-1
this movie nostalgic me . it reminds me era i miss greatly . many people here criticize its accuracy talking bad grafitti , acting , love songs , etc . what you guys mean ? i am new york puertorican , newyorican raised ravenswood projects , queens , bushwick , brooklyn went school spanish harlem . this back day when nyc tough . la familia , ballbuster , zulu nation ruled streets back then . so i guess i got right say movie accurately portrays life nyc 80 . some guy here criticized love songs . c'mon man . what , people back then projects didn't love anyone ?, girlfriend , etc ? i find movie so real i definitely want move back nyc . i know new york isn't same . south bronx renovated . gangs gone . all bombers , lee jeans creased down middle finely pressed jackets , pumas adidas thick laces checkerboard formation , boricuas their wild carribean looks , its all gone . but i need go back , if not play chinese handball schoolyard one more time . i didn't give it 5 stars because there deleted scenes . why won't they come out dvd including those deleted scenes ? i guarantee you everyone bought this dvd would buy one also	-1

" logan run " great nostalgic 1970s science fiction . 70s great era sci-fi , where future viewed optimism , awe wonder , unlike digital-age , cookie-cutter sci-fi we get today , offers nothing but gloom doom . i just little kid when " logan run " first released , but i remember blown away it premise -- futuristic society young people living inside futuristic domed-city , where you're not allowed live past age 30 . there really no where runners ( those who refuse end their lives 30 voluntarily ) go elude sandmen ( city police ) , outside domed-city post-apocalyptic , laid ruins earth outside-somewhere near old city washington . .. michael york plays logan 5 , one sandmen who turns out more heart than city would probably prefer . richard jordan ( francis 7 ) his fellow sandman/friend who fiercely loyal city status quo , begins doubts logan loyalty this status quo after he finds logan hanging around nursery . reason all this you'll find out when you watch movie . i actually wish they shown more domed-city than they . it really cool-looking structure , fascinating sci-fi concept . but you see exterior aerial visual-effects shots city movie opening , then few glimpses afterward , but after opening shots , movie quickly gets story surrounding characters , lot scenes take place sets scenes location . like redressed shopping malls , because indoor malls new 70 , people still fascinated these indoor shopping arenas , so it made sense redress one these new malls represent interior futuristic city . but miniatures built exterior aerial shots domed-city really cool look . some people , probably younger people who grew up this cgi age , ridicule film city looking fake like model . yeah , if you squint , you makes out few imperfections , but so what ? minatures look spectacular their time . but all dated aspects this film what makes it all more interesting . imperfection more interesting than perfection anyway . but " logan run " one last sci-fi epics . those stand-alone films like grand mgm stamp them . everything today so cookie-cutter bland , production companies you've never heard putting out direc t-t o-dvd caliber movies faster than bic corporation putting out pens . it just not same anymore . but definately purchase " logan run " dvd . it even better viewing it widescreen , it shown theaters	-1

writen starring harvey fierstein , this 1988 film adapted stage play . it set new york world gays 1970s , before aids . but even then , life certainly not bliss harvey fierstein . early childhood harvey knew he different . adult , he works feminine impersonator accepted himself , but every day he confront his gayness . he uses humor cover up his hurts that why this film considered comedy well drama . but even though i laughed out loud certain points , it still poignant moving story individual search love respect . there two men harvey life . one ed , bisexual who can't quite come terms living gay man . he actually gets married harvey new " love his life " , alan , played mathew broderick invited visit . naturally there complications . but two men resolve them , move new apartment make plans adopt 15-year old gay boy . it then tragedy strikes alan viciously murdered . most important relationship , however , harvey relationship his mother , played ann brancroft . she supposed jewish all jewish stereotypical expressions . sorry , but i didn't get it . she comes across caricature rather than real person . , she played role better , i might even small amount sympathy her . this didn't happen . all i amused she tried act jewish . it good role . it just needed better actress . exception ann bankcroft acting , i really liked this film . harvey fierstein outstanding it clear role comes straight his heart . rest cast good job cinematography good . side note , part this movie filmed across street where i live . i even remember when they filming it . it depicts neighborhood dangerous one . not true all . but , after all , this movies . i definitely recommend torch song trilogy give it high recommendation . it depicts time place world gay men unfortunately ended when aids came scene . i just wish casting would better mother role	-1

this bleak , bw film 1950 revolutionary its time , but i bit sympathy those who might find it stylized even little pretentious today . what truth ? -- surely hard theme tackle . seems me whether samurai killed dagger or sword could easily determined -- least today . there would fingerprints , etc . other hand , consider how much story depends interpretation . samurai really look his wife disgust after she raped ? after all , only she would really know -- he doesn't say anything . she really fierce , bandit says , or weeping weak she appears court ? kurosawa really poking fun genre clumsy fighting , or he depicting stark reality audience still romanticized ancient times ? ending really redemptive -- i found myself wondering if woodcutter would go off sell child if it girl . even though kurosawa intended it uplifting -- note shining sun--couldn't we wonder otherwise ? i found this film extremely interesting precursor notion truth ambiguous -- but not non-existent . anyone notice during machiko kyo ( wife ) testomony , score sounded suspiciously like bolero -- but not quite . it written composer named hayasaka , but i haven't uncovered anything , except i'm not first one think this .	-1

one themes christopher guest likes both making fun people who obsessive certain things rest us don't care too much , together looking deeper how obsession cloud their outlook . imagine we talking nerds or geeks , but people doing this stuff don't see it like . they wouldn't care anyway . i like this film more than some mr guest other films due fact actors get show they musicians too , which adds so much more experience . listen carefully lyrics songs - put subtitles if you need ... it worth it . said , there couple songs there actually growing me , both sung mitch mickey . these " kiss end rainbow " " when i'm next you " - melodies catchy . leave real world behind while watch this . you may well lighten up result ! wonderfully entertaining film .	1
two great child stars blended together into one suspense movie . although , you don't really get feel suspense because peaceful flowing music , message behind plot would really give you chills . elijah wood acted out every expression he act out fully his face . you could really see fear his eyes when he realizes henry(macaulay culkin ) planning hurt someone . story begins vast highland then starts off mark ( elijah ) playing soccer his friends . then , out blue , his dad appears we brought hospital scene where mark sits beside his mother deathbed . he promises her she won't die . unfortunately , she mark full sadness her funeral . his dad go business trip japan 2 weeks leaving him behind henry family . first , he gets well henry but soon finds out his evil schemes . henry always gets away all his schemes his angelic smile . i thought elijah great , he always all his movies . though he only kid back then , he acted his heart . macaulay , i thought he really showed sense madness jealousy but lost expression times . he great expressing silent anger suspense . he showed he fully dark side . although he little changes facial expressions reactions ' home alone ' , i still give him credit acting such difficult role . if you've never stage or films before , you'd never know how hard it act villain than hero . some scenes really impressed me especially cliff scene . it amazing how production managed shoot part without any visual effects especially two young lads . all all , i thought movie entertaining . i impressed how 12-year-olds could really well their age . i'm already 15 experienced acting stage you all must know . it not easy . before critizing their acting , you think they're only kids i say , they very professional . if you like movies suspense drama , you'd better watch this . these two very expressive actors . highly recommended	1
i wasn't sure what expect this movie before i saw it . after i saw it i thought it great . tom hanks exactly what you'd expect guy whose won 2 oscars morgan freeman gives very powerful performance well ( fact his monolouge end incredible ) . definately worth your time , book same name	-1
this movie might save few kids if their parents get it . real evil fact many large corporations target kids time they diapers . commercials aimed directly little kids get them eat foods harmful your health . fast food only one many fall into this category . adults realize poor diet harmful your health but kids lured these " pushers " garbage contrary everything we want kids eat . once they hooked they nag you until you get them next fix french fries . think it clown , play areas , free toys , yummy food , what kid would not love it . least movie makes it clear eating this stuff cause your organs shut down shorten your life span . sure adults just say no , but kids trust enough actually believe no one would harm them just make buck . parents must stop this schools need keep this food out ofthe cafeteria . i just want also touch industry aspect exploits work force uses lobbyist maintaintheir cheap disposable work force . sure corporations enjoy big profits when you hire people , pay them almost nothing , provide no insurance , fire them without union mediate , put them harms way no regard their safety but this how we all lose . we all pay taxes cover housing , medical , law enforcement , education , etc while corporations enjoy increased profits . they stay business because government looks other way happily taking money so they blast us commercials election time vote them . we all pay price high our integrity what stake right our way life	-1

even though i would agree " erin brockovich " entertaining movie , julia roberts performance it no more oscar-worthy than her performance prostitute " pretty woman . " i am second no one enjoying good " david goliath " story , but this movie such shaky roots reality , it more tall tale , than " true " story historic class action suit , i would imagine , left more unhappy plaintiffs , than it satisfied ones . however , movie title implies , this indeed erin brockovich story , same way " xena " character main attraction " xena : warrior princess " ( though it should noted xena wardrobe considerably more modest than erin brockovich character ) . erin brockovich vain , brassy , boorish , single mother three young children , no marketable work skills , transparently opportunistic manner , who dresses very much same way prostitute character roberts played " pretty woman " ( prior richard gere character taking her infamous rodeo drive shopping spree ) . movie beginning finds erin unemployed pursuing personal injury lawsuit connection automobile accident ; her lawsuit lost , primarily thanks her own disastrous testimony ( swearing , cursing shrieking witness stand ) while questioned opposing counsel . unbelievably , erin parlays failed lawsuit into job her attorney ( played albert finney ) firm , mainly pushing her way into office ensconcing herself desk . later , while handling paperwork run-of-the-mill , pro bono , real estate sale , erin discovers file contains seller medical records , , reasons she ( correctly ) not understand , seem particular interest buyer , mega utility company , pacific gas electric . erin independently embarks her own personal investigation case discovers pge ( decades ) negligently contaminated ground water ( surrounding one their power plants in/near hinkley , ca edge mojave desert ) toxic , hexavalent chromium . this discovery leads queen mother all class-action lawsuits ( least terms award ) , which hundreds hinkley residents sue pge ( through representation erin boss ) toxic tort action eventually nets 330 million dollar settlement plaintiffs . roberts gives photogenic , if not especially gifted , performance her role erin . movie contains plethora flattering shots roberts ( literally gushing out skin-tight , low-cut , bustier-inspired " work clothes " would never permissible attire any employee law firm this planet ) she engages warm fuzzy discourses unsuspecting unsophisticated hinkley residents . while there much said erin apparent drive tenacity she pursues plaintiffs suit , she not especially likeable character ; rather , she rude , verbally abusive only conciliatory kind when if it serves her interests . albert finney considerably more appealing believable ed masry , aged weary attorney who erin boss . bantering occurs two generally amusing ; unfortunately thanks inept direction camera work , focus these scenes seems more roberts ( strutting short leather skirts noisy , five-inched-heeled mules ) than sometimes-interesting personality dynamics seemingly exists two characters . aaron eckhart plays affable , gentle biker next-door-neighbor , george , who becomes erin boyfriend-by-convenience . " convenience " factor totally one-sided erin benefit exclusively ; she unabashedly uses george free , live-in childcare , thereby giving her necessary freedom assist masry they put together historic case . erin eventually winds up receiving staggering two million dollar " bonus " check ( masry ) when tort action case settles ; contrastingly , george gets " thanks " his nanny services erin his walking papers . plaintiffs case assortment simple individuals unpretentious outlooks life , who dealt dirty hand utility giant . though hinkley residents sympathetically portrayed , make no mistake-this movie erin brockovich ( indeed , i not think there single scene which chacracter not present ) less brave struggles life-threatening , generation-spanning illnesses real-life plaintiffs forced face , due toxicity their water source . erin brockovich presented viewing audience ( typical hollywood fashion ) sort heroine ; but fairness it would seem more accurate say she woman who indiscriminately used people , walked others when necessary seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky got rich . movie entertaining-absolutely . inspiring- not even slightly .	-1
plot synopsis please read amazon review . i wish talk reasons why you love this film . longtime fan both sam raimi ( evil dead series ) bill paxton ( aliens , twister ) , i went see this opening night . not many people claim this i'm sure because it , such small film received next no marketing . shame . this film best tradition modern film noir including blood simple fargo , both made cohen brothers . film buffs able draw connections those films their filmakers , so i won't bother get into . should you seen either these films enjoyed them , i suggest you stop reading immediately rent simple plan . if not , keep reading i try express why this film so remarkably brilliant . why i hope you take look it . simple plan , its core , four people . underneath all plot devices twists , it how they relate one . notice i did't say characters , because this film doesn't actors simply delivering dialogue . it people you get know , understand sympathise they undergo most brutal dilemmas . sure , finding mysterious bag filled money excellent plot device , but heart this film much simpler than . it basic human flaw committing criminal act trying weasel your way out it . forced most unthinkable things process . that what gives this film such depth . you watch these people try figure out how cover every angle so they get away stealing whole lot cash . end it falls apart two reasons : details human factor . they say devil details this never truer than crime . human factor , where greed concerned , people cannot trust one because they fear other person greed while unable satisfy their own . many respects this film almost homage blood simple fargo , but many ways i think it superior . i often draw comparison scene which both simple plan blood simple where body increasingly difficult dispose . even afterwards , after emotional toll taken , once one evil act committed , sure follow . it so painfully facsinating watch person work out their problem camera , frantically going over details their mind , all while their heart beating mile minute . bill paxton this better than anyone . he such likable man ( both film life ) you can't help but feel sorry mess he created . his entire performance balancing act getting away seemingly harmless crime , keeping his partners bay their mouths shut while prodded his conspirator wife . may make them all sound malicious , but really opposite actually true . they're all normal folks , like we've all seen hundred times . end it really gets you because you imagine how you would react same situations they find themselves . after all , you faced choice steal couple million dollars no one would miss , what would you ? but then again , nothing ever simple	1

" greetings " offbeat satire very young brian de palma starring equally young robert de niro . vignettes focus three friends . first there jon rubin ( de niro ) , aspiring filmmaker who idea creating " peep art . " this would consist filming " private moments , " then letting people view them through tiny windows , thereby re-creating peeping tom experience ( more this de palma much better 1970 film , " hi , mom ! " ) . however , if you expecting see amazing performance one great actors his generation early film , you going disappointed . de niro comes off overly mannered bit forced his performance , especially comparison his two co-stars . his best moment off-screen he talks woman through going bed his peep art ( she repeatedly forgets not talk ) . but he lot better two years later decent career , least until he started making credit card commercials . first there lloyd clay ( gerrit graham ) , conspiracy nut so obsessed jfk assassination half-naked woman sleeping his bed just opportunity show paths indicated bullet holes not match up ( unless jfk shot while standing his head ) . lloyd shares his deep , dark thoughts directly viewing audience he argues vigorously convince us he right . but sometimes he finds people real world assault his blow-ups zapruder film reduce assassination rorschach test . finally , we paul gerald shaw ( jonathan warden ) , who would like find right girl . his problem he his induction physical going vietnam really hurt his love life . fortunately , lloyd jon fully ideas how paul get army reject him , everything pretending gay coming sergeant ( lloyd idea ) volunteering shoot not only vietcong but also any american troops color ( jon brainstorm ) . there no real narrative thread here , which hardly criticism because " greetings " more ancestor " groove tube , " " saturday night live , " " second city tv " history contemporary sketch comedy heavy satirical bent . difference what de palma his friends come up " greetings " more experimental guerilla theater than really polished sketch comedy . but there something compelling its enthusiasm , which makes us forgive filmmaker his actors when things go bit too long . de palma admitted influenced godard french " nouvelle vague " cinema , which inspired going out street trying improvise scenes ( only they not enough film improvise , so they ended up rehearsing most film save money ) . but even this early work , de palma clearly into doing everything you movie camera ( inter-titles , split-screen , slow-motion , fast-motion , etc . ) . " greetings " historical footnote cinematic history inasmuch it first film u.s. given " " rating ( later changed " , " which what it would qualify today because some shots nude women ) . terms social history " greetings " represents some counter-culture politics late 1960s . it almost thirty years since i first saw " greetings " " hi , mom !

this what science fiction supposed , thought provoking . excellent imagery . superb plot . well developed . wonderful ending .	1
many say books always far better then movies . i agree this . i read whole entire series ; anne green gables rilla ingleside . i devoured every single one , enjoyed all characters sad when i finished reading them . but i say movie very , very good ! megan follows superb job portraying anne , jonathan crombie so good gilbert . every single actor beautiful job made their personalities come alive . i heard myself say , " they shouldnt made movie book , they ruined everything doing so . " but when i watch anne green gables , i say this differen t.t hey only brought more story different way . anne avonlea continuation story , i loved one just much . i say though , anne green gables continuing story disapointed me very much . they changed plot , characters still what you loved but joy you usually felt when you watched first two isn't felt when you watch this one . it so different book it made me mad . part i like it though , when anne gilbert get married , its bittersweet yet lovely part movie . end when anne finally finds gilbert , its beautiful moment too . so my opinion this : buy anne green gables , anne avonlea , story told beautiful way . but only rent anne green gables continuing story , don't buy it	1

other film reviewers characterized nicholas ray primarily strong director film noir other dramatic creations focused individual psyche . many his films attained cult status , many relatively low budget , i.e. , lonely place , dangerous ground , etc . this film quite different them . screenwriter , philip yordan , wrote many hard-hitting dramas spanning three decades , this screenplay continued his excellence realistic , spare dialogue . there no long-winded speeches this film , it achieved its purpose largely because way ray directed it . yordan collaborated nicholas ray few other films , two them fashioned , king kings , similar dramatic structure taking place two thousand years ago . if one sensitive person , he or she automatically drawn this film . nicholas ray definite romantic streak his soul , which amply delineated king kings ' many scenes viewed over over . pick virtually any scene movie , you not able stop yourself feeling ray sensitivity portrayed these bibilical characters . however , it not just screenplay direction , but overall production itself , make this film truly memorable . i think you mood film length , it far cry visually stimulating films you see these days , ones which quick cut rule . not nicholas ray , though , viewer plenty opportunities study film characters , since ray camera spends just right amount time each characters ' faces us feel their emotions . characters ' movements key appreciating film ; there no other director who could convey feeling through movemen t.t he acting uniformly excellent , aided yordan realistic dialogue . several reviewers lauded jeffrey hunter jesus , which deserved , while robert ryan demonstrated range accomplish role john baptist great authority . unfortunately , his role typically short it left ryan devotees again jonesing more him picture . this sad state ryan seemed experience too many his films . king kings ' use 70 mm technirama wasn't lost this dvd , which brings true light imaginative sets , colorful costumes one actually notices when watching film . orson welles provided stirring narration penned ray bradbury . reason welles allegedly dissassociated himself film must viewed context film background circumstances . film cut pasted producer samuel bronston , characters deleted final editing phase . one actually see british actor , anthony steele , background few seconds when jesus arrives jerusalem palm sunday . i would love seen unexpurgated version film . acting superb all cast members ; hurd hatfield performance called over top internet reviewer , absurd statement . his performance perfect my opinion . also , rip torn , quite appropriate , frank thring , complicated portrait , harry guardino * ignore new york accent , bridget bazlen , rita gam , viveca lindfors , siobhann mckenna , all well , lindfors mckenna very affecting their sensitivity , character actor , royal dano , emaciated but convincing his cowardice , ron randell , australian actor who should better success hollywood , guy rolphe george coulouris ( their roles seem clearly shortened , especially coulouris ) . i second motion 99 percent reviewers this movie , i.e. , those who liked appreciated film . it must-see , must own , particularly if you high definition widescreen television . colors cinematography , coupled continuously engaging score , amazing . some scenes so gorgeously re-created they brought back memories i seeing film theater when it came out 1961 . technicolor really comes through when viewed under ideal circumstances	1

" we tell you what think .

( 3.5 /5 stars ) brian depalma film , one usually expect good deal more than simply involving story . he talented craftsman , who delights making his films into experience . " femme fatale , " which depalma both wrote directed , he draws us onset refusing show face our heroine . then , prolonged scene set up story , which ravel " bolero " used good effect . set against backdrop film premiere cannes film festival , this scene wonder behold . plot film rather implausible requires some suspension disbelief order appreciate it . if one invest time effort , however , film provides enough action plot hold one interest . ultimately , depalma gives his audience credit recognizing difference fact fiction , so he fun plot twists turns . i won't go into story here because i don't want give away anything . fans antonio banderas might disappointed because he doesn't show up first forty-five minutes or so . this really rebecca romijn movie , she very decent job . it worth watching least once might worth owning if you depalma or romijn fan .	-1

this episode star trek , " man trap " my earliest memory what would become lifelong enjoyment franchise . truthfully , " man trap " terrified me ( i maybe two , or three , although i am sure time series limping it third season i seeing repeat first time ); star trek considered " adult programming " , such i not allowed watch it - i used sneak behind couch while my grandfather watched it nights i stayed their house , then would lay awake my bed scared what i'd seen , but excited just same . like space show i enjoyed terrified ( lost space ) , i didn't recognize star trek anything but world i wanted very much , but remained frightened anyhow ( i , i said , very young ) .	-1
flipping through cable stations late one night , i came across bearded alan bates intellectually poetically analogizing fig " female part " before party mesmerized embarrassed picnickers . i , too , mesmerized , especially quiet , deep , limpid restraint scene , little subtle expressions faces main characters revealing their fundamental natures , bates clear , precise voice , his deadly serious playfulness , rich green english countryside , etc . oliver reed reaction monologue especially impressive its understated humor intelligence . i not able finish film , but what i seen it stayed me uncannily powerful way , lo behold within week i discovered dvd version borders all places . i since watched it completely part dozens times . it , enormous brideshead revisited , best adaptation novel i ever seen , d.h. lawrence novel ! i'd thought it impossible , but these fellows pull it off then some .	1
leos carax pola truly one most engaging films come out past decade . throughout movie carax ( lovers bridge , boy meets girl ) creates visual poetry which both innovative contemporary . film may create sombre mood throughout but it engages you limit you start looking things way carax wanted you . i am inclined write review this movie because various negative publicity misleading reviews it received over years . true , this not your usual run-on-the mill type even art house genre , but it definitely worth watch . pola ( based herman melville " pierre , or ambiguities " ) actually acronym french title movie " pierre , ou les ambiguities " [p-o-l-a ] . ' ' pola derives shooting script carax tenth draft his screenplay . protagonist pierre(guillaume depardieu ) , young novelist coming rich family prolific background , writing his new novel but falling short new ideas . his otherwise mundane lifestyle turns upside down when he meets disheveled dark haired girl , isabelle ( golubeva ) , who resembles girl he dreaming some time . she turns out his illegitimate sister , secret he kept dark all these years . pierre finds her inspiration newer ideas opportunity break out his routine lifestyle . he breaks his engagement his sweetheart lucie ( delphine chuillot ) embarks journey isabelle - provide her all love , support protection world denied her also stimulate his own creative instincts . it definitely disappointing see even after so many years its release , few minutes sex scene pierre isabelle seems get all attention . it true it graphic but it sensual - innovatively shot use tricky camera shots , colour use light shadow . carax didn't want make it look like one those " guide sex " videos . i find pace movie quite appropriate justice unfolding story . scene forest where isabelle talks her past seems tedious first viewing but it settles you successive viewings . isabelle anxiety , insecurity pain , which she could not share anyone so long , could shown manner only . also who forget background score scott walker which supports sombre mood haunts you throughout movie ? superb cinematography clever use light shadow techniques makes it visual treat - completely sync script . fact this film which tries tell its story visually rather than using long dialogues . i see this film reaching cult status , may 25 years down line , when those criterion collection guys come out its special edition . but time i strongly recommend it those who want unique cinematic experience break usual hundred million budgeted hollywood blockbuster crap	1

three films famous " bounty " ship , this version clark gable charles laughton i liked best . this version my feelings never swayed whom i liked ( gable ship mates ) whom i despised ( laughton ) . clakr gable fletcher christian light hearted man who friend all . his shipmates looked highly upon him , even though many forced join long voyage . he sympathetic crew plight often times tried his best protect them many vast punishments . when christian fully fed up majorly unfair antics bligh his mission , he finally decides take command bounty . christian , once he command , never looks back takes his followers back paradise unknown uncharted island live rest his days . captain bligh military man bone who demands respect all , achieves it through his rough tactics , stern discipline often times uncaring ways . he leads his ship navy war rules book one hand whip other . his actions most certainly deemed unfair , unjust most all harsh . bligh feels fear one captain only way lead earn respect . way he almost seems relish finding ways " push man buttons " so he then take out his navy rules war book give reason punishment . his sole reason mission first , duty second no matter cost ones health or life leads eventual infamous mutiny . unlike other 2 " bounty " films whose capt . bligh times came across too sympathetic ; charles laughton portrayal capt . bligh came off more aggressive , uncaring unlikeable . it easy hate him cheer his eventual downfall . great performance . other " bounty " films good definitely worth watching ( especially marlon brando ) , but best lot this great black white 1935 version gable laughton .	-1

this movie very interesting very well . i don't think this comedy all , though it light moments . i personally wouldn't call it " innocent " either , because there lot pain caused people aversion anyone outside mainstream . but it honest moving . family members conflicted totally believable reactions their unique sibling/child . this french film so universal , it could anyplace if language dubbed . beautifully filmed acted , several complex characters , no easy answers or pat resolutions . feels like life . p.s. boy never considers himself " gay . " he considers himself " girl . " thus all references " bent " much more confusing him	1

_the good shepherd_ paranoid delight , detailing rise central intelligence agency ( cia ) it initially developed following world war ii . directed robert deniro ( who also role film general who played key part creating cia ) , this film shows us rare glimpse into world spies counter-spies , paranoia , secrecy surrounds cult intelligence . much film indeed accurate portrayal history said agency its role america foreign policy decision making throughout much twentieth century . film follows career edward wilson ( played matt damon ) his early years poetry student yale university , periodically spying his professors who allegedly linked nazi-sympathetic organizations , his role development allied intelligence community during world war ii , creation cia birth cold war beyond . film one epic proportions ( some compared it other classics such _the godfather_) essential viewing all thinking people . world undercover operations , no one trusted . whether or not certain individual fact working allied intelligence , nazis , or later soviets simply cannot determined , we witness this world develop sense trust breaks down paranoia ensues . movie travels back forth events gave rise bay pigs fiasco ( also hinting later kennedy assassination - believed some conspiracy theorists work cia ) earlier career wilson . yale university , wilson joins up class upper crust wasps ( " old americans " ) takes part their adolescent rituals part ultra-secretive skull bones fraternity . ( many our political leaders arisen this fraternity some conjectured they responsible wielding true power world . movie even hints idea they may responsible " soviet power " well , true puppet masters behind world events . ) wilson falls love deaf girl ( he certain " weakness " deaf girls we see later movie ); however , brief affair his upper class girl leads unplanned pregnancy thus forces him marry . ( however , it should pointed out one gets impression " elites " manipulating whole thing behind scenes anyway , because throughout movie never once definitive proof provided child even his . furthermore , he go away long time aid allied war effort thus not even there see his newborn son . ) his early days spying university professors ( or they really ? ) , wilson becomes more more involved intelligence community . this leads him serve side allies during world war ii . following world war ii , allied leaders make trade nazi scientists jewish scientists , thus begins cold war soviet power america britain contend control world . eventually series events force wilson make ultimate sacrifice - one many his desire further aims american imperialism consolidate power cia . movie also shows hints such historical realities presence homosexuals intelligence community ( fact their homosexuality used blackmail them - rites skull bones fraternity could also described vaguely homoerotic matter ! ) cia experiments drugs ( particular lsd ) . there some rather chilling lines uncanny prophecies this movie which haunted me days following my viewing it . one point robert deniro character remarks it " clerks civil servants " who gave hitler his power , thus it necessary somehow limit cia power because otherwise it runs risk creating totalitarian surveillance state . secondly , one point movie matt damon character ( wilson ) asked joe pesci ( playing italian mobster ) what " his people " ( presumably upper crust wasps ) , mentioning italians church , jews their tradition , blacks their music . this , damon replies they united states america rest just visitors here . point , it said people cia never put " " front cia . when asked why , they reply putting " " front cia would like putting " " front god . ( angelina jolie character remarks several occassions during dinners skull bones fraternity they first account all members bonesmen then invoke god . she puts it , " agency first , god second . " ) these some chilling lines movie . ultimately movie raises some very disturbing questions nature government . america heads further further towards surveillance state ( brought further direction each impending war ) , it becomes necessary examine where we come . asked movie , elite controllers who make break world events try keep war minimum , or they merely use war further their own agendas consolidate their power ? certainly scary question ponder . i feel this movie offers much think ( ultimately very frightening ! ) , but so long tough questions remain unasked people remain asleep wheel , it much easier those power slide us off into totalitarianism . finally , i should say i find it odd this movie ( which not only offers much food thought but genuinely very well put together ) gathered such low reviews . perhaps it just further indication fact public not like think ask questions this scary itself .	1

i went into my viewing ' departed ' more than bit cynicism . seen film ' departed ' based upon - hong kong thriller ' infernal affairs ' - i prepared take snobbish view original far superior . adding my skepticism neat little line i read press effect hollywood just bestowed upon martin scorsese its best picture prize what , most opinions , approximately mr. scorsese sixth-best film . [ instance , ' departed ' could second-coming ' godfather ' no way could it surpass brilliance scorsese ' goodfellas . ' i hope there more than few voters now kicking themselves casting their votes ' dances wolves ' - film hasn't aged well all , especially given costner post-wolves car wreck career vs . scorsese decades-long brilliance . ] anyway , surprise , surprise : ' departed ' brilliant its own merits . it borrows - but not copy exactly - alan mak felix chong original conception . three things make ' departed ' succeed : 1 . scorsese uncompromising vision - ' infernal affairs ' featured some some pulled punches : fateful fall building ends bloodless , almost artful landing car roof ; ending seems crafted sequel mind ( , indeed , ' infernal affairs ' spawned profitable trilogy ) . no such pullback scorsese : same fateful fall results shocking splatter blood ; film brutal denouement - which ends quite differently original - lays waste any possibility sequel . 2 . william monahan brilliant adaptation - his script mashes up mak/chong ' affairs ' tale elements ' brothers bulger . ' result hand-in-glove fit its boston setting . , native bostonian , i found most accents spot-on , led locals mark wahlberg matt damon . 3 . damon/dicaprio/wahlberg triumvirate - these three guys outstanding . damon continues choose great roles perform brilliantly them . he key film , sell covert version himself both his police superiors movie audience . he goes full-out , southie-bred bostonian here . it awesome portrayal . those who think that not acting , compare him here vs . takes jason bourne tom ripley . this guy force . dicaprio his equal here , but surprise here wahlberg . his role simply didn't exist ' affairs . ' it relatively small part , but wahlberg completely steals every single second he screen . he deserved oscar nomination .	1

i loved this film . lot people who like it said it hokey silly , but wonderful . i found it little silly times ( especially romantic subplots ... although i love heston " women poison " line , then grahame responds " it wonderful way die " ) , but most part , it wonderful film really details how circus life unfolded . it documentary feel times , because it really dives into how much endeavor it put show . film also shows actual circus acts almost their entirety , not cut up some stupid montage sequence you'd get these times . technicolor photography some most beautiful i've seen ( wonderfully restored this dvd ) , crowd scenes ( demille speciality ) superb . no cgi here , all people real , all acts real . while there probably stunt doubles leads , it still real . performances top notch , especially stewart ( who always makeup ) , heston . heston great actor , he constantly lampooned current media personalities " hammy " his stance guns ( other conservative issues ) . i think it all bs . he damn good almost everything he . betty hutton gorgeous shapely . nice see time hollywood when you didn't anoxeric get part or star . look close lawrence tierney , who plays rival heston . yes , it tierney , who played joe reservoir dogs , 40 years later . train wreck ( minatures ) bit awkward silly , but dramatic aftermath well . superb piece cinema mr. demille ...	-1

bicycle thief ( vittorio de sica , 1948)one things i adore italian filmmakers they know how end their movies . whether it completely understated ( michele soavi dellamorte dell'amore ) or so over-the-top " cheesy " doesn't even begin describe it ( argento suspiria ) , you know you're going get some sort reward build-up . bicycle thief no exception rule ; you see ending coming mile away , but doesn't make it any less payoff . antonio ricci ( lamberto maggiorani ) trying get post-world war ii italy , where poverty rampant . he lands job hanging posters , which he needs bicycle . family sell bedsheets get his out repair shop , but that all right , innit ? after all , he making money now . until , , morning his first day job , his bicycle stolen one city ubiquitous bicycle thieves . rest movie , antonio , aided his son bruno ( barefoot contessa enzo staiola ) some friends , goes looking his bicycle and/or guy who stole it . antonio , consumed more more random injustice thing his frustration indifference rest world his plight , finally hits bottom , expected results . antonio , no point this movie , good guy . even when he top world , just gotten his bicycle out hock , he berates his wife stopping visit seer ( scene that actually one film most suspenseful , since you know his bicycle going get stolen , you just don't know when ) . he berates seer , yes , which later becomes integral part his character , but his wife well , which integral part his character right then . he never all good his kid . he orders his friends around like mussolini . when he gets frustrated , he takes kid out grilled cheese sandwiches two them proceed get plastered ( allowing antonio -- de sica -- rumination class structure , daughter wealthy patron restaurant catches bruno eye ) . all this , way , morbidly funny , yet you know you're watching tragedy , antonio low-rent lear or titus andronicus . maggiorani -- who , despite turned ( his big-screen debut ) one great performances italian film point , never landed anything more than supporting role rest his life -- plays antonio if he knows antonio andronicus , but not if antonio knows antonio andronicus . that great stuff , right there . i've putting off watching this years because , honestly , i no idea why movie bicycle thief would captured imagination critics public alike . well , now i know , i tell you , they're right . this fascinating study man slow descent into obsession , it well worth your time . ****	-1

granted , i saw this movie three morning party , but i think i enough sense me realize how truly horrible it . it so ... bad . it some seriously subpar performances pretty much all involved , script just awful . gosh , it hard believe i actually sat through it . it just so ... exactly what it , i guess . stupid sex comedy that absolutely terrified anything else . thing really pushed this above radar me blip truly offensive tone some material . i think my real downfall here fact i'm gay guy whose friends mostly straight guys . scenes regarding certain character his chance encounter homosexuality so repugnant it almost ridiculous . now , i'm not one get offended easily , but this just took it bit too far . just attitudes behaviors expressed most characters just made me depressed , which isn't really something i look movie . it just seems me if ' gay ' replaced ' black ' , this would deemed racist probably wouldn't ever released . not i'm condoning censorship , but when your tone becomes so ... mocking , i guess . oh well , i guess all i'm trying say i definitely not repeat viewing this film , i don't recommend you view it all if you're woman , or gay , or you care others	-1
" where sidewalk ends " winning film noir/detective story . dana andrews plays troubled cop reputation abusing suspects . fact , he whacked demotion very outset . events get complicated when he slaps around his very next perp- war hero- guy hits his head dies ! wse quickly high gear . da attempts clumsy cover up . his new boss , karl malden , quickly fingers rough tough tom tully murderer . he perfect fall guy , but audience , not mention da , knows he innocent . plot boils when da gets involved tully daughter , gene tierney . here perfect uptown girl decidedly downtown location . this plot contrivance actually believable . da let his girlfriend dad go sing sing death he caused ? resolution unmentioned here . viewers watch wse themselves but those who not disappointed . wse fast moving highly credible . there required nighttime shots sleazy night spots , dingy tenements , dark alleys dank garages . if there daytime scene , this viewer missed it . suspense maintained throughout , even though audience all " evidence " . reuniting andrews/tierney ( after " laura " ) director preminger complete success . this reviewer made mistake ! he reading silver ward " film noir " peeked ending ! even so , resolution wse still great one , almost shocking ! viewers urged savor atmosphere this film/noir detective classic take fadeout it comes .	1
i love films which unfold complexities slowly , use color deep intention , don't rely words say everything must said . end affair lovingly carefully adapted film . fit into time , i feel you must allow film like this stand its own . many adjustments made story , what eventually emmerges , me , even more cohesive personal . one thing i particularly love end affair , color pallette sharp attention clothing . i love sarah red suits , her green jacket , her hair ( carefully suited time ) , way colors stand out , but subtlety , every scene she stands until her character begins fade . this movie permanently affected my aesthetic sensibilities . * most * affecting aspect movie me however , able deeply relate character sarah , i think many people . most us our superstitions , even when we work keep them subdued , certainly seemingly " miraculous experience , " or great trauma ( they usually go together don't they ? ) bring those things surface . i thought bendrix henry dynamic played out film fascinating . it created contrast two ways living really : one figure , content live straight line , climbing little little bits satisfaction but no passion , other all passion anger intensity . henry , way , created passion sarah felt maurice . he bottled her up placed her shelf where she simmered , i think " vulgar sex scenes " some called them , extraordinarily necessary if you want understand emotions going . then again , sarah religious devotion followed her commitment henry , which before vow she seemed no intention lessening , so you also see she more than sensual person she maurice , she also practical wife . neither role she playing . every central character this film , dichotomy , more than , they wonderfully spectacularly flawed , which certainly core graham greene insightful philosophic writing . this labrynth film , rich unanswerable questions , contains most brilliant use perspective i ever seen . if you , like me , like watch good film several times , i recommend listening neil jordan commentary least one viewing , then watching it again . -stephanie	1
these people who appeared soundtrack movie o brother , where art thou . there whole lot more aseach performer invited sing other songs well thebest them carefully recorded ryman auditorium inthis wonderful concert , but it all carefully packaged this dvd interviews , glimpses into backstage frenzy goes concert like this . emmy lou harris , alison krauss union station , late john hartford emcee/musician , host gospel , bluegrass country musicians make this perfect dvd friends over watch . perhaps my favorite tracks two numbers gillian welch partner david rawlings . both participate other artists well , but it closing pair numbers dr. ralph stanley give this dvd stamp historical significance . if you not own this dvd , your music film libraries incomplete	1

" aguirre , wrath god " movie i discovered roger ebert " great movies " wanted see long while . film directed legendary german director werner herzog , whose work i've only recently introduced . i've seen only one other film man film " stroszek " which appeared ebert " great movies ii . " when i review film , i usually base my star rating entertainment value . there lot great movies aren't very entertaining . i liked " stroszek " but i noticed herzog slow , pacing style similar kubrick . this film , he plot could make suspense/action film . instead , it slow paced film madness , greed , other things . it easy see why film considered great film . it great . beautifully shot , terrific performances , definite directorial brilliance . movie entertainment value low , it moves same pace " 2001 : space odyssey " even though it contains lot more dialogue . movie first pairing director herzog actor klaus kinski , relationship just famous films they together . movie lore states herzog threatened kill kinski , while brandishing gun him . kinski claims his autobiography he only one onset gun . am i only one who thinks image germans threatening kill each other funny ? first all , movie spanish conquistadors which makes fact film german bit strange . but doesn't matter . movie gonzalo pizarro doomed expedition find city el dorado . movie oft mentioned opening shot one most beautiful i've seen cinema . it shows long line people walking down steep mountaintop valley down below . plot begins when pizarro stops , realizing el dorado might not exist after all , sends much smaller party explore farther upriver . party led guy named don pedro de ursua , while aguirre ( kinski ) second-in-command . several more key players , including aguirre daughter inez , priest named gaspar de carvajal , ursua wife also there but i'm not going get much into plot so bear me . even though aguirre holds rank second-in-command through most film , he running things throughout . when raft gets stuck water , he declines send someone save them , so forth . out all wonderful shots film ( there lot ) my favorite haunting final shot , which i won't reveal here . i've never seen film kinski didn't even see kinski until i saw this film . man fits role so perfectly . he got face looks like it chiseled 14th century sculptor , wide lips when curled back make him look evil deranged . what i've read kinski , it seems he almost playing himself while playing aguirre . i'm glad i saw this film , but i don't see myself watching it again . i acknowledge it great film , haunting film even , but it only going click movie buffs just how good it . i wrong before though . i've liked films much more once i grew familiar work this film definitely herzog stamp it . it good film , where theme more important than plot . it moves slowly , isn't extraordinarily entertaining , but it great . entertainment : c+cinematography : adirection : aacting : adialogue : b+grade :	-1

i saw this movie when i 25 years old , same age michael o'keefe , very good young actor . i agree reviewer his range emotions ... anger , love , compassion , superbly expressed . i think he should won best supporting oscar time , but instead academy gave it timothy hutton ordinary people ( fabulous young actor ) . robert duvall , course , brilliant always . i seen movie several times , each time it reminds me two struggles duvall : dominance over everyone around him , struggle masculinity father son ( duvall o'keefe ) . this struggle interesting study father who very proud but yet threatened , manly sensitiveness , athletic ability , spunk his own son . first indication this when they playing basketball together . o'keefe typical vigorous 17-year-old ( almost 18 ) , expertly dribbling shooting duvall into increased anger frustation . i think very quick whack duvall gave o'keefe butt o'keefe slightly bending over , very skillfully dribbling ball away duvall , first indication he his father .. boss . you don't embarrass boss beating him . i even thinking , because duvall such jerk -- please michael , let your father win ! next , terrible scene performed so well -- when duvall , furious o'keefe not relent giving him two point extension , stadiscally bobs ball o'keefe head , humiliating him calling him his favorite girl . o'keefe retaliates yelling " this girl whipped your ass good , colonel ! " . i thought duvall would start physically fighting his son smart , but retort so smart , it left duvall silent paralyzed . those two chemistry , truly great together . watch it , performances move you much story typical but challenged , military family	-1
i loved this film . but you may very well not like it all . answering couple quick questions help you know whether you should stay away eight crazy nights : anything artwork offend you ? honest here ; there nothing wrong you if you offended content . if you're kind person who might say , " i normally don't mind ( or i even like ) crude humor , but just went too far " , then answer " yes " . if you think artwork go too far , if you any personal sacred cows , then very cautious watching eight crazy nights . next , you like think yourself more mature than you , say , 13 year old ? i don't just mean , " you more mature " , but you pride yourself , so you don't find joy playing 13-year-old again . if yes , that indicator caution . finally , people who actually teens who answered " no " above questions , you dislike your crude humor any positive messages or sentimentality ? if yes , use caution . it not eight crazy nights most outrageous , risk-taking , potentially offensive comedy ever , or it constantly juvenile or ever over-the-top sappy . offense maturity , there nothing here that not found average episode south park . but maybe because it animated holiday film where many people aren't expecting something like south park , lot viewers -- especially offendable proudly sophisticated -- turned up their noses . eight crazy nights actually quite complex sophisticated many artistic levels . animation exceptionally well -- least good complex most disney features . example , there many subtle layering perspective effects , similar disney multiplane approach , often mimicking " live action " cameras , so different focal depths blurred . environments lush subtly modeled . characters fluid well drawn . there many difficult sequences , such action sports scenes , they're all very impressive . script-wise , adam sandler achieved film both mocks/spoofs traditional holiday films manages one same time . it not different theory , say , elf or bad santa , except sandler isn't all afraid continually go throat his brand humor ( which isn't suggest elf or bad santa bad films -- i love both them , especially bad santa goes throat sometimes , too ) . plot some similarities christmas carol main character , davey ( voiced sandler ) , over-the-top , bitter , bah-humbug attitude holidays brought past events . davey even visited something akin supernatural entities one point . sandler music music performances impressive . focus silly/funny lyrics , course , but times , his singing songwriting skills suggest he could easily career music business instead . while watching eight crazy nights i kept thinking how much i'd like see sandler penned broadway show -- would just thing help knock broadway out its frustrating musical content conservatism . couple characters , especially whitey ( also voiced sandler ) , take some getting used . sandler doing one his odd , affected voices character , whitey designed disturbing disagreeable . but course joke he symbol positive holiday spirit , so sandler again pulling rug out beneath our expectations -- something he regularly , many different ways , throughout course eight crazy nights -- that good thing .	1
i bought this dvd research purposes . i performing " promises , promises " musical based " apartment " . i am so glad i bought this dvd , this great film . that not just my opinion . " apartment " nominated 10 academy awards , won 5 , including best picture best director 1960 . this film speak you many levels . one level , it indictment corporate politics condemnation philandering executives . level , it examination extramarital affairs , sometimes dire consequences . level , it love story where damsel distress literally meets her white knight . then again , it people who fall into abyss , only find redemption happiness they deserve . it knowing what right , finally finding courage what righ t.t he cinematography great , lighting . setup perfect . we shown enormity life insurance company , its 31,000 employees manhattan headquarters . shots teeming , faceless humanity fantastic . long shots endless office fabulous , make you appreciate black white . out this morass , we asked get know 3 people ; c.c. baxter ( jack lemmon ) , fran kubelik ( shirley maclaine ) j.d. sheldrake ( fred macmurray ) . they embroiled love triangle change all their lives . late , great , jack lemmon wonderful c.c. ( chuck ) baxter . lemmon dapper 35 years age when this film made . he wants get ahead , he so selling himself out . he loans his apartment senior executives their extramarital assignations . they turn promise move him up corporate ladder . there humor this , baxter trys juggle " appointments " 4 different execs . but , rest this film , there pathos it . chuck quite thing cute elevator operator fran , played 26 year old shirley maclaine . she returns his innocent flirtations , but some reason keeps her distance . maclaine all sweetness vulnerability . so , why won't she go out chuck ? it turns out , fran boyfriend . boyfriend director personnel , j.d. sheldrake . sheldrake quite married , slept many women office , including his secretary peggy olsen . macmurray plays wonderful cad . he not sleazy or oily . he able continue stringing fran until one fateful christmas eve . i won't continue discussing plot , you need experience it it unfolds . while " what happens next " not huge leap imagination , skill actors sensitive direction make fascinating viewing . there some great scenes this film . pivotal christmas eve scene sheldrake fran get you visceral level . macmurray maclaine shine here ; her vulnerability his meeting her vulnerability incredible insensitivity . brilliant . lemmon shines " discovery " scene when he figures out fran involved sheldrake . sheldrake borrowed apartment rendezvous fran , fran left her compact behind . compact broken mirror . chuck , not knowing who it belonged , returned it sheldrake . later , christmas eve party , fran loans her mirror chuck , who recognizes it . lemmon communicated so many emotions his face , his voice , his body . he such actor . this movie listed among top 100 movies all time , it deserves place your shelf . highly recommended .	1
granted , this production made television they obviously intent keeping it play set design such . however , it certainly would better " film " if it given budget so . prime example " merchant venice " robert deniro jeremy irons . just wonderful cinematography attention detail alone give shakespeare extra touch realism makes truly satisfying film .

i watched this film after viewing nathaniel kahn more personal depiction his father . latter one intimate conversation dead . this one asking viewers share growing process living person , parallel through events recent history usa . leitmotif time history running personal perception interpretation these events . maya architecture , funny say , lot sensuality touch , which goes beyond visual . never any other film architect work audience so moved - detail depiction hand touching piece stone engraved names ; quiet flow thin film water over piece stone interrupted tip fingers tracing history place .... tears .... we see kahn architecture emptiness self order contain infinity universe most cerebral way ; while lin embracement past , present future most romantic sensuous . sometimes i wonder if it turning architecture into too much emotional apparatus ? anyway , i would recommend such interesting parallel viewing two films these 2 american architects	-1

one finest post-halloween horror films , funhouse features suspense shock equal measures . claustrophobic setting funhouse after closing time perfect stage elegantly lit carnage . director tobe hooper made more successful films , but my opinion , this his best . carpenter dazzled suspense halloween , sparking best worst period horror-film making history . this one best period . clever opening credits tip off edge this movie over spate low-budget splatter fests turned increasingly sadistic they tried outdo each other violence levels . here mutant killer his creepy brother ( film best performance ) sympathetic backstory . even sexual titillation tastefully . gore without guilt . i loved it	-1
tobe hooper , who recently unsettling dance dead episode masters horror showtime , well family classic , texas chain saw massacre ( 1974 ) , presents not so pretty picture carnival life , somewhat pathetic-albeit homicidal-monster decidedly unhandsome visage , penchant mayhem . opening film nod halloween psycho , two other masterworks genre , there builds into creepy story revolving around teen lust , sleazy carnival characters , `man-made ' monster needs like everyone else , but simply cannot satisfy them more socially acceptable ways . fascinating subtext running through story it variation tragedy dr. frankenstein his monster . tobe hooper tale , monster one born genetic mutation , cleverly foreshadowed freak animals alive tent exhibit , where fetal brother monster floats jar abominable attraction hoi polloi . indeed , film opening sequence , frankenstein monster carefully shown , first poster showing glenn strange characterization ( my favorite ! ) , then mego doll-oh sorry , action figure-carried young boy , joey , whose sister soon curses him because his bizarre prank scares wits out her . joey actions also subtext running through film : he dons mask become monster frightens his sister , actual monster wears frankenstein mask become less monster , therefore less frightening others . it interesting note , unlike current spate horror films feature eye ( popping)-candy little else , this film , characters presented choices , yet consistently make wrong ones . we all know , horror film , when you make wrong choices , someone , or more likely today everyone , winds up dead . amy , buzz , liz , ritchie , joey consistently make wrong choices , suffer dire consequences . tale dr. frankenstein his monstrous creation , wrong choices also led death disaster , but least here we funhouse ! funhouse surrounded carnival , seedy , grimy affair filled seedy grimy denizens . there bag lady looks very much like grandmama addams family spouting " god watching you !

sandra bullock plays reckless woman , supposedly writer , although this only mentioned once passing , who , her british boyfriend constantly boozing partying it up . she also seems hooked painkillers . after ruining her sister wedding , then stealing limosene drunkenly crashing it into house , she ( although this not shown film ) , sentenced 28 days rehab alternative jail . rehab , she meets some interesting characters various addictions , eventually starts own up her problems begin her recovery . rehab characters , who each curiously show us 30 seconds insight , seem promising , but what we learn them vague . lame chanting rehab center silly , it never explained why people buy into it so readily . times film played like educational video dangers alcohol/drug addiction , but even falls short there , center clearly lacking addressing some areas treatment . some performances decent , while others not so good . what happens after 28 days up , we simply assume what her life going like ? film seemed better suited tv movie , really .. i could keep nitpicking , but i think you get idea . although it kept me interested , i not exactly entertained , trailer hinted this entertaining film . i pretty much disappointed i	-1

robert bresson last film if very short 81 minutes , chain events two young boys start when they cash counterfeit bank note photography shop . what follows less tale greed money , more tale how little deceit go long way , much further than anyone would ever expect . main character unsuspecting delivery person , who happens come photo shop collect payment his services , gets knowlingly handed boy fake bill shop owner , plus two other forged bills he received previous occasion . this sets off chain events turns life upside down one innocent person wrong place wrong time . it also turns into tale how focused revenge this once innocent person gets . pacing very swift direct , leaving no time way console or relate characters or their actions , until long after images passed . viewer thrust into your face storyline , lethargic characters , merely walking their way through events take place . it almost plays out like one many cable true crime reenactment shows , rather than film . unlike truffaut or chabrol , bresson wastes no time getting deep into anyone thoughts or taking any time character development . my opinion , drawback this we never fully sympathize unfortunate turn events strike down our main character . i mean " fully " emphasis , don't get me wrong , what happens yvon character truly upsetting turn events . flipside this , what i feel benefit wooden , undeveloped characters : we sit back watch these dreadful situations more entertainment level than most other pessimistic dreary storylines . there so many instances this film either require second viewing , or just some simple reflection little puzzle solving bind together everything just took place . i fully understood enjoyed every aspect unbound ties left open ended bresson , except immediate ending . i still yet discern why crowd continues look direction yvon just come , without anyone turning their head he passes . it only piece yet figure out . i've even realized exactly why yvon actually turns violence end , which him saying jail he see character partially responsible him landing prison again , even though he moved maximum security facility . aspect you really uncover yourself , there no narratives or usual crime tips discoveries usually found this film genre . truly memorable film , one enhanced stunning widescreeen sharp transfer new yorker films . it shame it just went out print . there also some very interesting insights into bresson mind 2 interviews . well worth every penny	1
because sheer length this documentary number topics covered , it hard pin down exact analysis it , since so much going . i agree this historically important documentary , many powerful scenes , both during interviews just during scenes when camera wordlessly panning over what remains camps today . although it would too easy simplistic just automatically give this 5-star review say it best most authorative film shoah ever made . this no means covers nearly everything happened during shoah , even its massive length nine half hours . last hour devoted just warsaw ghetto uprising , but apart ghettoes aren't covered . what this documentary cover five six vernichtungslageren ( annihiliation camps ) poland -- treblinka , sobib�r , belzec , chelmno , oswiecim ( auschwitz ) , what happened people their way there death wagons . there interviews people all sides -- survivors ( including only two survivors chelmno , simon srebnik michael podchlebnik ) , ghetto guards bureaucrats , people who ran camps ( particularly franz suchomel treblinka ) , villagers who watched death wagons coming going ( their reactions these peoples ' fate what they claim them seems mixed ) , survivors themselves , polish diplomat jan karski , who begged world stop genocide he knew very well going . among survivors interviewed rudolf vrba , one my heroes , who escaped oswiecim 7 april 1944 his friend alfred wetzler try warn world what planned hungarian jewry . big plus supporting this documentary it made 1985 , when there more survivors around , most them younger than they today . though some people might turned off how much film subtitles , i enjoyed hearing all german , french , italian , polish , hebrew , felt my own listening comprehension german vastly improving film wore , times barely needing subtitles . all said , this film times feels like it overshot mark , since it covers so much ground even within specific topic extermination camps poland , yet doesn't really seem very structured . many times this documentary very nonlinear feel composition , which one level works since when dealing something like shoah , all concepts time place really become unimportant nonlinear , but even so , it also feeling just jumping back forth interviews footage . example , we return several interviews number times after long stretches covering other things . there also some segments could cut didn't really belong there , like dancing couple german nightclub . entire documentary , information merely presented ; no conclusions drawn , no analyses made , no archival footage used . some people might feel this just appropriate technique such nonlinear structure , but after finding out what ron rosenbaum say monsieur lanzmann book ' explaining hitler : search origins his evil , ' one led question why he used some these techniques why he doesn't feel there should any analysis shoah , no attempt explain why these awful things happened or account great evil took place , though accounting it somehow justifies it . certainly this important film everyone should see least once , but some effect lessened lack archival footage , nonlinear structure layout , refusal draw any conclusions , make any analyses , provide any historical background why these events set motion first place . it important film shoah , but no means most important one or most authoritative one ever made . price also seems little hefty ; it because this film huge reputation it costs much more than most other four-disc sets ?	-1
i vaguely remembered this film cable or network tv . time release go-go eighties it seemed somewhat anomaly it highly critical view role first world third world misery . i agree somewhat review " bad writing " sating sugarcoatingof role us murder hundreds thousands leftists just vietnam getting underway . also film reminded me somewhat " quiet america " , " missing " , " killing fields " ... it showcases what goes wrong third world when there outside meddling . romance ( sigourney weaver mel gibson ) social political issues don't fit well they could , or only one plotline- preferably social political- my opinion may made this more powerful . but , like somewhat happy ending , this type sugarcoating , unfortunately , usual hollywood fare . nevertheless , this may gibson weaver finest roles . it definitely their most socially conscious . helen hunt , playing billy , transgendered role , fabulous worthy oscar more . journalists , other westerners , also played very well quite smarmy , case british general embassy party , indicative ongoing power andthe somewhat anachronistic roles empire- particularly british . finally i wish movie could bit longer offer more depth , but 90% films it couldn't exceed two hour maximumtradition . also movie displays incidents 1965 made 1983 , but it seemed like it could taken place yesterday . it too badthere isn't movie similar this current middle eastern debacle .	-1

this movie epitomizes sub-genre " french films " . which say it engenders every tired stereotype what makes some french films either unwatchable or unenjoyable ( other type films france or french directors , including jean-pierre juinet/luc besson/ etc , who good sense pacing action frenetic mood ) . explain my statement stereotypical french films , movies question consistently consist stilted drama unlikable characters who not much use concept understatement or indoor voice , whose lives always immersed melodrama , whether or not circumstances warrant it . these films also not seem place much value pacing , indeed regard slow plodding progression indication depth thought , even if such elements not evident . something else seems troubling french film ( if not culture itself ) seemingly nonchalant attitude physical coercion sexual encounters . more than one interview gerard depardieu cavalierly waxed nostalgic participating gang rapes during his teen years . correspondingly , this film more than one occasion where teenage girl assaulted , each case matter regarded minor ( if any ) attention best . there also inveterately disfunctional interactions all parties this film , so common . it turns out , hardly characters particularly likable or sympathetic . father conveyed marginally sympathetic character end , until his encounter lise . one thing i give french credit they not feel compelled towards using formulaic , predictable happy endings . aside this , title apt metaphor plot mentioned other reviews . however , i not very impressed film , plodding execution other reasons listed . i didn't think movie completely terrible , but i also think it wasn't very strong ( barely 2 stars ) . additionally , both film synopsis several other sources guilty misleading descriptions regarding so-called erotic/sensual nature girls ' relationship . if this why you renting it , you very disappointed . otherwise , if you unremitting francophile or praiser foreign films , you find some excuse laud this film , if no other reason than your need .	-1
futureworld(1976 ) cheesy low-budget rip-off sequel westworld(1973 ) , reminds me many low-budget rip-off sequels planet apes same era . futureworld holds up much more poorly time than westworld , mainly because it trys use too many technological gimmicks , which look silly 30 years later . westworld far higher-quality production , coming main studio(this one came 2nd rate studio ) . westworld directed michael chricton , much more realistic " scary " than this movie - especially role yul brynner character . some sets simply awful - i especially loathe one where main characters keep coming out behind metal grate . look box structure metal grate built into - what purpose it there ? ... look wall behind it - it metal rollup door ( it probably kept half rolled up , characters probably ducked under other side get into box structure ! ) ... context movie set , whole thing makes no sense , looks absolutely absurd considering how much screentime it gets . oh , other than weak performance peter fonda small appearances yul brynner , movies ' cast list looks like guest star list all episodes year rockford files tv program ... we even stuart margolin ( angel ) playing main part	-1

dario argento directorial debut brings us intriguing murder mystery . anyone fimiliar argento works should thoroughly pleased this film . while it not nearly violent his other slasher flicks such " tenebre " , not same level " deep red " or " suspiria " , it doesn't lack suspense or style .

derrida said this film : " it either master piece or catastrophe ! " film deserves five stars various reasons , yet convincing him allow it produced reason enough ! ( derrida against project , until it began ) . producers superbly deal aporias authorship - effacement biographic fixity ( explored derrida foucault ) violence signature text production . producers ' brilliant solution reflexively expose play this tension , rather than ignore or succumb it (- otherwise , there would no dvd ! ) . title going " chasing derrida " , how pertinent , but dropped whatever reason . it seems then amazon reviewers - both favorable negative - miss point : this film not providing philosophical depth or biographical richness . it creating aesthetic piece stimulates our curiosity deconstructive thinking , not authorship or questioning , but investigation trace alterity : engagement other which so much fascinated derrida . such , while film provides glimpses slipping trivia deconstruction , i totally agree derrida own opinion : " i love this film !	1

fan hard scifi , i must say this film meets standard admirably . not only there interesting plot - discovering what happened attempt terraform mars - but there both action thoroughly plausible scientific speculation . story moves quickly , there plenty surprises , acting quite good . there even spiritual dimension it subtle rather than your face . center story , which opens character study disrupted unforeseen ( potentially deadly ) complications , scientific mystery . thus , there unknown , puzzle must solved some best minds earth well disciplined military . details revealed , there sudden unexpected developments , revealing more more characters their mission . then there vision future part all great scifi . i found all details believable , somewhat clueless interactive computer voice capabilities unpredictable amee , multi-capacity military robot , environmental catastrophie earth necessitated terraforming mars , last chance human survival . together , this makes rivetting believable story throws some great characters into mix . i watched it several times complete enjoyment . warmly recommended .	-1

this book refreshing antidote modern day bias . during time when ideology mechanics take precedence over truth objectivity , it refreshing read slavery impact various levels society ; clergy political agendas blacks who also profited . few today would disagree slavery terrible blot american history , but mrs. stowe book great job portraying people " people " . black or white , clergy or not , humanity inherent weaknesses - strengths - not confined any one culture or society	1
my impression this movie it seems six-hour mini-series cut down 116 minutes , not too successfully . only plausible reason i see its utterly confusing disjointed scenes would they trying create uncertainty one would feel society recently disrupted some cataclysmic event . if there any sort plot , it attempt young man try care orphaned children . he wants emily help him this endeavor ; however , it seems every time they get together they engage sex , even when little kids room them ! then , they sort break up when guy wants take some feral children , or least children who live like they brought up some wild animal . what victorian scenes story anybody guess . some would suggest it some sort fantasy julie christie . whatever purpose victorian scenes , twice they resort nakedness . once decidedly unsexy middle age , heavy woman stripping completely naked . second when four-year-old emily sleeping , her night gown risen up ; she turns over her back , fully exposed mid-chest down , some man , presumably her father , covers her up . if they needed show fully naked children , it would seem me much more understandable group bath filthy urchins joined children group . little emily coming uncovered , tucked loving parent isn't anything any parent preschool daughter hasn't naturally happen ; it it just didn't seem anything catastrophe movie . my conclusion this movie too disjointed erratic much use raising any personal or social issues could discussed . after watching movie one much more likely asking what all instead discussing or thinking some edifying issue it raises	-1
ok , so this movie not scary , or even intelligent least bit . if your watching this thing hoping truly frightened , then maybe you should go elsewhere . but if you like corny , bloody " horror " movies , then this one you . i watched this movie one day , reasons i can't explain , i couldn't stop laughing . what mummy pulling people brains out their noses wire hanger ( resulting mass red jello ) , demon cat latching onto man crotch , there no way not enjoy ridiculous hilarity tales darkside . crowning comedy jewel this film , though , gargoyle love story . i already knew how this thing going end 7 minutes , but i wasn't expecting hilarious muppet-esque gargoyle . or part where starving-artist-guy picks chick up off street ( no , not hooker ) , , telling her streets dangerous , he just takes her back his place they get it . yeah , keeping her real safe there , pal ; nice line . part where , even though he knows he shouldn't , artist just sketch , paint , sculpt likenesses gargoyle he saw . like it so freakin awesome-looking , he just can't get it out his head . thing looks like toothy chameleon wings ! like something stephen king made up when he five ! but i guess this artist thinks it really cool , ' cause he would put his own life danger just make play-doh model it . what dork . anyway , this movie hilarious . now , all actors play it straight , if not overly dramatic , so i guess this supposed serious scary ? i don't know , but angle definitely doesn't work . so just watch this movie revel its horrific cheeziness . you'll good laugh . i know i	-1
" browning version " movie i discovered library . it wasn't synopsis peaked my interest or anything , but i nothing better i got movie free ... so i figured , why not ? movie classic so loved oscar nominated director mike figgis ( best director , ' leaving las vegas ' ) he remade it 1994 . browning version film some people find dull , it completely built characters dialogue . there no action , no profanity , no sex . latter implied times though . michael redgrave ( who i'd never heard , but saw interview him that dvd ) plays andrew crocker-harris , teacher . whom we only briefly see beginning film don't meet until we find out it his last year teaching school . all his students overwhelmingly happy hear news . glance , crocker-harris mean , emotionless , man ; all his students hate him . only one , young boy named taplow ( brian smith ) feel sympathy him . getting glimpse into his home life , we learn his wife millicent ( jean kent ) frequently openly cheats him . nigel patrick plays frank hunter , science teacher affair millicent but growing like crock . plot simple , but features wonderful dialogue astounding performances . particularly redgrave . i realized his performance great while watching film , but after watching interview i see it pretty amazing . man characteristics voice completely different crocker-harris ; it deservedly won best actor cannes film festival . hopefully this movie gain more notice fact it criterion collection . if you stumble upon this movie , or even if you splurge few bucks rent it , it wonderful intelligent movie . redgrave final speech end evokes same reaction us , it his students . grade :	1

i saw this film first time three weeks ago , it my second favorite film , behind only schindler list . this film contains every element person could want film : great acting , great music , excellent directing , fantastic moving story . biggest thing i against this movie what people say it , it not chick flick , nor " tear-jerker " yes it very emotional , but story not love two main characters , it redemption nick nolte character . this film my opinion best film streisand any man watch . it managed discuss something most men hard time discussing ; their emotions !! i played this my father , who forty-six , it his favorite film . anyone who beyond sterotypes respect story , man situation , not afraid little love emotion , should love this film . this nick nolte best film , he not anything after this even comes close . goes streisand , krabb , george carlin . they well casted , their performances make this film very memorable one . this film not anyone who thinks women only ones who watch love stories , guys only ones who enjoy terminator .	1

if you don't like long , slowly paced movies steer clear " wings desire " . this not film you watch conventional sense , looking plot-relevant action after action . it takes much more impressionistic approach its story . lesser director hands film would simply rambling , aimless dreadful , but end result anything but . i am hard pressed think five films contain such full-bodied , interesting characters . voice-over film beautifully written interspersed , but it not voice-over instructional narration ; think it stream-of-conscious device : characters ' thoughts , their observations ruminations , heard soundtrack if leaking out unknowingly , allowing viewer eavesdrop . this could easily left viewer type scientific voyeurism , but far it gives characters humanity might not otherwise come out . v.o. isn't contrived or stilted , it sort semi-realist mental drip poetic bent , but it doesn't feel forced all . it expresses frustration isolation trapped ones own head , seemingly inescapable prison intellect emotions , top contend outside world reconcile yourself it . this something better seen than explained . i talk this aspect film so much because it symptomatic nature film : meloncholic whimsical . but all it meloncholia it never felt bleak or joyless me ; perhaps i too enamored characters lyrical cinematography . if this stuff isn't your cup tea it seem like three hour water drip , i suppose . i think take angel predicament seriously miss point film , which say it no " point " or lesson all , but then none films i like pedantic bent . this movie just extended observation into collective consciousness , which makes it sound pretentious but it really anything but . instead film end i feel bit uplifted assured , if beauty inner life not go unnoticed or unfelt . i think this film you must take personal level really appreciate it	1

1993 1999 , popular television show japan called " iron chef " ( " ryori no tetsujin " ) pitted its acclaimed one its professional chefs against challenging chef each week using particular theme ingredient all dishes made . show hosted flamboyant chairman kaga ( takeshi kaga ) who opened each show , presented challenger , unveiled theme ingredient gave brief synopsis before winning chef declared . show gained popularity syndication u.s. food network using mixture dubbed english subtitles . due rising popularity show cable subscribers , upn tv network decided broadcast american version show 2001 produced larry thompson organization lions gate television canada . unfortunately , these two companies failed effectively reproduce elements japanese show made it so popular . instead , they created poorly written directed substitute akin watching wwf wrestling match , not challenge two professional chefs . first mistake larry thompson organization lions gate television made their selection new chairman " iron chef usa " . though i very much enjoy william shatner his roles captain kirk original " star trek " tv series , t.j. hooker show same name his more recent role attorney " boston legal " , his attempt chairman " iron chef usa " far too farcical clownish taken seriously trying replicate takeshi kaga flamboyance original japanese tv series . their next mistake commentaries . during each original japanese " iron chef " shows , group commentators ( which included culinary expert ) would explain what each chef doing , well analyze possible dish outcomes . " iron chef usa " commentators treated two chefs if they athletes would even send annoying " field reporter " ( sissy biggers ) ask them stupid question while they busily preparing their meals . their other major mistake their selection judges . most japanese " iron chef " shows included actual food critic one judges , well japanese actors , actresses sports personalities , who quite articulate their critiques prepared meals ; but " iron chef usa " judges inarticulate inexperienced . not surprisingly ( quite thankfully ) , only two episodes " iron chef usa " starring william shatner ever produced entitled , " iron chef usa : showdown las vegas " " iron chef usa : holiday showdown " . each these shows dvd i rate well-deserved 1 out 5 stars poor mockeries much more entertaining original japanese version . 2004 , food network produced its own version entitled " iron chef america : battle masters " included two beloved original japanese iron chefs , hiroyuki sakai masaharu morimoto , hosted takeshi kaga nephew , mark dacascos . it far better show than ill-fated 2001 " iron chef usa " . if you considering purchase 2001 " iron chef usa " dvd , you so your own risk	-1

i consider myself well schooled low budget schlock various film genres . watching cheesy films acquired taste , one not easily cultivated overnight . even some knowledge who makes these types films under my belt , i still stumble over major contributors clunker movie catalogue wonder why i haven't spent time these delicacies before now . roger corman my latest discovery . i admit i heard corman before reference spate vincent price horror classics emerged 1960s , few other films he made over course his career , but until now i never saw many them . this guy giant low budget film , producing or directing some 500 plus movies last forty years . he still going strong far i know , never limits his output one particular genre ; he made westerns , horror , action , drama , science fiction films seeming ease . moreover , according bio this dvd , corman helped launch careers numerous hollywood bigwigs . if " big bad mama " any indication , i continue spend lot time this filmmaker projects near future . " big bad mama " sort feminist reinterpretation those movies depression era highway outlaws ; it " bonny clyde " lipstick long tresses . angie dickinson plays wilma mcclatchie , mule headed , dirt poor texas woman temper desire better her conditions . life hasn't easy wilma , not two young daughters raise ramshackle cabin out sticks . what woman during these tough times ? why , strike up relationship local bootlegger barney ( noble willingham ) , course ! but when wedding ceremony one wilma daughters goes horribly awry , barney perishes shootout , wilma left holding several unpleasant bags . feds involved bringing down barney , led bonney ( richard smith ) , now set their sights wilma her kids . unfortunately , mcclatchie plays right into their hands taking over barney illicit liquor operation . some point , wilma decides she enough poor decides hit road search ill-gotten gains . she takes her two lascivious daughters , polly ( robbie lee ) billy jean ( susan sennett ) , ride . why not ? if you're going embark crime spree , you may well make it family affair . problem , wilma cannot escape lure sleazy , good nothing men . she first hooks up wanted criminal fred diller ( tom skerritt ) , quickly consummates their partnership old fashioned way . then conman extraordinaire william baxter ( william shatner ) enters picture , wilma brings him into fold well . resulting jealousy diller baxter , most unusual relationship struck up diller wilma daughters , certainly lead dangerous tensions within gang . despite these internal stresses , wilma continues plot next big score . gang finally stumbles upon perfect scheme ; they infiltrate soiree thrown bunch rich folks kidnap one them . mcclatchie her compatriots succeed abducting jane kingston ( joan prather ) , but plan fouls up when diller decides get up close personal hapless heiress . then baxter pulls fast one . then cops g-men close . cue gunfire crashing cars . roll credits . who live who perish ? surprisingly , you'll actually care answer question while watching " big bad mama . " i've seen several corman classics now , " big bad mama " ranks one better ones . first , you've got solid cast filling all main roles . dickinson not only looks fantastic , but she believably portrays poor woman looking out her own nothing lose . tom skerritt , actor i've never liked anything , actually manages avoid annoying me murderous jealous fred diller . shatner , well , he probably his most restrained here role requiring him talk softly oily tones . i got kick out daughters . both them so far over top you can't help but laugh their antics . sure keep eye open their dancing routine local veteran get together . anyone dense these two airheads ? guess so . thankfully , performances unfold against second important element makes " big bad mama " lot fun , namely film great atmosphere . while i imagine plenty anachronisms plague movie , i thought 1930s props looked way better than i expected see low budget picture . finally , you really get opportunity see angie dickinson take few risks , so speak , but you'll miss it if you blink . considering what actress role , i'm surprised she took part when she still player hollywood . dvd standard standard roger corman release . you get obligatory short interview leonard maltin , bunch trailers . sequel " big bad mama , " unoriginally entitled " big bad mama ii , " came out roughly ten years later . while i haven't seen sequel , which apparently once again stars angie dickinson , i say first film lot fun . great performances , bountiful skin , sleazy attitude , wonderfully realistic atmosphere makes this corman classic must see movie fans .	1

decalogue indeed collosal moving people said . each film inspired one commandments , although commandments never mentioned directly . kieslowski made these films all one year , which me amazing . this made polish tv , showing television doesn't completely stupid all time . all these segments full moral ambiguity , clear answers never given , just like real life . i love fact kieslowski never answers things directly . if this american production , it would gone 2 ways . first , it could right wing , simplistic , heavy handed " message " film would dumbed down level 4 year old , like " afterschool special " . or it could whiny , left wing politically correct " tolerance " episode where everything would worked out because people basically good everyone needs self esteem . either way both insulting disingenuous . i especially like 2nd film , where woman , who affair pregnant her lover , husband who hospital . her husband could possibly die . she pesters doctor find out her husband condition , partly out concern , but because her fetus well . she tells doctor if her husband lives , she'll abort fetus . if he dies , she'll baby . that very murky , morally ambiguous situation . when sitting through this part , i wondered what i would situation . i haven't clue , really . when i saw clint eastwood masterpiece million dollar baby , i thought these films , because eastwood film kieslowski films dealt morally complex issues adult artistic way . these films life art . there no time this film ( or other segments ) where you feel you're lectured , i love it . it religious things , but religion isn't mentioned . it morals , yet , you don't feel it . it great art , that all , enough .	1

" fun ? yes , but neither great movies . " spiderman 2 " great movie . we forget who actors . kirsten dunst girl-next-door mary jane watson fantastic , beautiful ordinary simultaneously . rosemary harris looks much like aunt may anyone could . finally , tobey maguire so perfectly cast peter parker , all seamless . i fully recommend spiderman 2 . i'm ready " spiderman 3 , " hope producers realize there enough good spiderman material make five movies good this . anthony trendl editor , hungarianbookstore.co	1

i really enjoyed this film i know nothing soccer . i liked acting teacher i found relationshop cf his students very heart warming . unlike others though i not like hair . it put me mind something large furry crawled onto cf head died . never mind though , he looked great otherwise performance surprisingly complex moving . i liked ending unlike previous reviewer . you looking more detail ? you miss point he could quot ; move onquot ; his passion new one	-1
even great actor like harvey keitel cannot save this film . mr. keitel best what they give him which almost nothing . keitel patriarch family suffers through his continuous schemes make money , most them centered around non-existant mining operation swindals . if you're going make movie con games then least tell us something them - might make movie interesting ! if keitel unconventional attempts earn living meant backdrop story family relationships , fine , give us inter-personal drama , but we don't get either . this film drags simply forgetable regretable . nothing happens this film - nothing	-1
i never heard this movie , fact never knew it existed until just recently .. however , i only state how deeply it affected me .. it so very profound .. it so beautifully wonderfully photographed others stated .. very intimate sex/love scenes tastefully .. however , after reading numerous reviews am wondering if some reviewers saw same scenes i ?... question so called ' rape ' scene .. well let me refresh your memories [ ones who seemed ' missing ' this ] ... scene happened shortly after chinese man [ her lover ] witnessed very suggestive scene when brother his sister dancing together .. oh so very close almost erotic !! this scene implied something very indecent like incense .. look his face told it all .. everything there .. every emotion showing his face ... disbelief first , deep hurt when he realised what actually happening them .. then feelings betrayal then anger .. this manifested itself later batchelors quarters when he angrily slapped her face then proceeded quietly but brutishly take her .. i not view this rape , it understood .. he felt betrayed , angry shame what happened .. her family [ white trash ] just treated him so shamefully too ... but it scene he just witnessed she danced ever so closely suggestively her brother made him so angry .. she understood .. she made no moves stop him , she not shout out neither she participate act ! ... also i noted how deeply he must cared her when he gave her his beautiful very expensive ring must meant so much him .. ring which belonged his deceased mother .. so much poignancy his face when he pulled ring his finger ... ending too so superb , i felt so deeply moved sad think finally after she realised how much she care him it too late .. it always too late ... what fabulous , heart-wrenching , moving story ..	1
i bought this my son because i wanted him see old classics instead all nickeloden crap . it good one . we both enjoyed it very much .	-1
say this great film probably overstatement , but it certainly great idea film . gibson looks good , weaver looks good , hunt acts good , weir directs good , script better than good . much . it movie ideas , which earns high marks these days , so few flics make claim . sure , it stumbles bit , ending purposely frustrating , carry forward theme white guilt " what then shall we ? " beyond all , it sensual , unpredictable , pretty damned intelligent . seen anything lately multiplex fits bill ? i ain't . see it yourself .	-1

this film reveals jesus far different than serious detached version one usually sees other films . this four hour , word-for-word , account " matthew " , bruce marchiano remarkably portrays jesus who he - first century jewish man ... compassionate ... loving ... giving ... sorrowful ... joyful ... real ! even his appearance " real " - weather beaten ... slightly dirty tunic ... hair flying . i highly recommend this film - you'll fall love this jesus . i understand bruce plans produce " gospel according john " but needs support - i hope he gets it because we need film " real " good " matthew "	1

lover lane .... no brainer slasher movie straight video its really horrible . lover lane hot spot where you wanna go make out but 15 years ago some people murdered up joint 15 years later , some relatives people who murdered up there ( always ) tormented present but " hook man " urban legend . pretty much snoozer bad acting ( who calls this acting good ? ) . how many screaming teenaged girls we seen movies ? it only works if movie good this not good movie . plot twists turns arent even great .... idiotic writing . starring : riley smith ( radio , 8 legged freaks ) , erin . dean ( lolita , pig tale ) , suzanne bouchard ( joyful partaking ) , sarah lancaster ( four kings , dr. vegas ) , diedre kilgore ( good luck , falls ) , billy o'sullivan ( change heart , rites ) , matt reidy ( hit run , carried away ) anna faris ( scary movie 1-4 , just friends ) one her earlier movies . nothing save this thrown over cliff .... it ridiculous	-1
i went see this movie when it first came out , i nearly fell asleep watching it . this movie not worth watching . it so fake , it easy tell whats going happen next	-1
this any entertainer ultimate fantasy . power kill critics who you feel ruin your reputation deny you legitimacy . edward lionhart { played price } ham actor theatre circuit who loved works shakespeare so much he devoted his career various salutes tributes playwright . london top critics felt lionhart wasn't too original they became annoyed his shakespeare tributes so they always gave him terrible reviews simply because they wanted him take hint something other than shakespeare . well , lionhart felt he deserved critics circle award but critics gave it newcomer over legendary lionhart . this prompted him jump multi-story complex presumed dead . he comes back life aided his demented daughter , two kill eight nine critics who most insensitive their reviews . each critic killed using murders shakespeare plays they respectively panned lionhart . example , one play hapless victim eats his own flesh blood ( robert morley appears homosexual critic who force fed poodle soup ... his character didn't any children so his two poodles closest thing he " family " ) . death came when price plays ' butch ' , gay hairdresser who electrocutes furture wife , coral browne . this film hilarious it two messages . first : critics power over public opinion it often their take movie , play , or record album often persuades public into investing their time or money into something . second : no matter how personal how awful review might , offended party shouldn't kill his/her attackers . ignoring bad reviews denouncing critics dummies proper way handle pious critics . seek out this film enjoy lionhart happiness getting his revenge . critics so cynical full themselves you no sympathy them { however , you pity one likable critic who tasting wine drowned lionhart dunked into wine barrel	1
watching this hilarious sequel original hit film like watching live action looney tunes . its fast paced motion , plethora gremlins doing wild crazy things , all " jokes " reference original , this sequel just good if not little better than its original . other than insufferably cute little mowgie , other gremlins horrific little demons who stop nothing wreak havoc luxurious high rise perpetrated donald trump tycoon ( mr. clamp ) . virginal heroes original back even snow plow driver his wife show up . it all mindless , reckless fun very entertaining . zach galligan phoebe cates appropriately naive mushy ; john glover hoot tycoon ; robert picardo fine glover henchman , robert plosky looking like grandpa munster funny dick miller jackie joseph ( who appeared original 1961 little shop horrors ) good snowplow driver his wife . even almost 20 years later , these guys hilarious	1
this jazz-fan delight : tons jazz , featuring tenor saxophone some bebop thrown . most music nice mellow stuff interesting hear , even non-jazz buff like me . music interesting story made me purchase dvd , which i subsequently watched few couple times . story pretty laid-back , simple tale american alcoholic sax great playing france who reforms because french fan who cares him . dexter gordon unique voice makes helps him become interesting character hear real-life jazz great proves decent actor , too . francois cluzet plays admirer who goes out his way help his idol . gabrielle haker pleasant watch cluzet young daughter . she always seems pleasant smile her face . i don't why this film rated " " because there no sex , no nudity , little profanity except several " mf , " which must reason rating . nevertheless , it pretty tame movie . even though story bit slow would probably bore heck out most young people today , i found it entertaining definitely different . it just nice , gentle story , whether you fan jazz or not .	-1

1970s artistic prime peanuts specials , " it easter beagle , charlie brown " no exception . voices , animation , music all superb . it some quite funny moments , such store their christmas decorations up marcie antics eggs . i wish some music released cd ( i don't know why it wasn't charlie brown holiday hits ) . it classic perrenial show . some disliked lack religion , but i think schroeder quote , " it time renewal , start spring " sufficient . " it arbor day , charlie brown " foreshadowing poor quality would come 1980s . it made 1976 , one year after " my valentine , charlie brown " , but voices aren't good . voices main problem here ( although they're still better than ' 80s ) , but they're not only one . backgrounds aren't good , baseball field more brown than usual , even all plants . even vince guaraldi music isn't quite lively usual . still , this good show some quite funny moments . it fun special obscure holiday , even though i don't know when it . i don't understand relevance charlotte web 2 game , other than just commercialism . i think it only works three five age group . regular advertisement would more useful . this fun dvd .	1
written joseph minion ( after hours , vampire kiss ) directed barry shils ( wigstock : movie ) , motorama ( 1991 ) stars jordan christopher michael ( " full house " , favor ) gus , ten year old boy dysfunctional family who decides one day take it road . also appearing great many semi-recognizable names and/or faces including dick miller ( piranha ) , jack nance ( " twin peaks " ) , robert picardo ( " star trek : voyager " ) , flea ( blue iguana ) , mary woronov ( night comet ) , garrett morris ( " saturday night live " ) , michael . pollard ( roxanne ) , john diehl ( stargate ) , martha quinn ( chopper chicks zombietown ) , sandy `jack klompus ' baron ( " seinfeld " ) , vince edwards ( " ben casey " ) , meat loaf ( fight club ) , charles tyner ( longest yard ) , irwin keyes ( house 1000 corpses ) , susan tyrrell ( cry-baby ) , shelley berman ( meet fockers ) , drew barrymore ( scream ) , who featured prominently dvd cover but appears all ten seconds film . i mentioned earlier , jordan christopher michael plays gus , ten year old boy who , fed up this messed up family , decides hit road stealing cherry late model mustang . now i should probably mention film , which appears set american southwest , actually takes place sort alternate type reality where states different names than those we might expect ... example , landscape featured may lead one believe we're arizona , but within film sign might say we're state essex . anyway , way gus starts participating game called `motorama ' , sponsored gas station chain . game involves cards given customers after purchasing least five dollars gas . participants collect cards , they remove affixed sticker , hopefully reveal letter , idea collect all letters spell out word `motorama ' win grand prize which 500 million dollars . gus travels filling station filling station ( always buying only five dollars worth gas ) , he comes across all kinds bizarre individuals including pious gas station attendant ( diehl ) , motel operator ( nance ) who unusual prejudice towards squirrels , psychotic , simple-minded busboy ( flea ) , vindictive security systems designer ( baron ) , so ... gus collects more more cards , game becomes somewhat obsession , one begins take its toll both physically mentally ( gus seems aging fairly rapidly ) . eventually his travels lead gus virtual no man land , nightmarish state marked over industrialized landscape ( oil refineries what not ) plethora individuals even more bizarre previously experienced , all search final card he needs win game , or so he thinks ( always , sure read fine print ) . if what i've written doesn't make whole lot sense , then you should try watching this film . i suppose there message or two emerges end , but after ten minutes i stopped trying comprehend much what happened story doesn't seem written accommodate viewers expecting straightforward tale . way , surface this may appear film geared towards children but that certainly not case there some violence , profanity , even bit nekkidness , all which contributed movie `r ' rating . there some comedic bits throughout , but many these seem include dark element . one scene particular features gus , need funds , stopping roadside rest stop challenging family man , played dick miller , game horseshoes money . miller character loses pay up , forcing him pull hansel gretel routine his two , small children ( seems he afford support his entire clan rest their journey ) . this tone much humor , so if it doesn't sound appealing , then you'd best skip this film altogether . i'm unsure if i supposed like character gus throughout film he portrayed not only criminal ( stealing car , motorama cards , siphoning gas ) , but he also appeared somewhat smarmy , smart-mouthed , patronizing punk need beating ( which he receive , more than once ) . but then again it not like i related any grownups movie , so whatever ... i mentioned earlier number performers appearing film but one should known most these performances brief jordan christopher michael only person we spend any meaningful amount time ... he seems like decent actor but this type material it seemed me one could act any number ways still film come off relatively same , eccentric road trip into land mondo . there one aspect i found annoying , even after i stopped trying make sense things , near end when things come full circle , manner speaking . times it seemed film weird just sake weird ( which i dislike ) , but other times there seemed some genuineness , so i'm willing give movie benefit doubt . all all this real curiosity piece , one probably won't appeal most audiences . picture format this columbia/tristar dvd release seems something oddity me it presented fullscreen anamorphic . that right , i said fullscreen anamorphic ... what hell point ? seems me those interested only fullscreen format would care less if picture anamorphic , those interested anamorphic aspect would looking original aspect ratio presented theatrically . either way it kind shame there tons scenic desert vista shots would come across much better original widescreen format . picture itself comes across clean , dolby surround 2.0 audio comes through well enough , subtitles available english , french , spanish , portuguese , chinese , korean , thai . far extras there squat , unless you count trailer 2001 david spade film adventures joe dirt , which i don't ... cookieman108by way , andy summers , former member band police , supplied original music this film . some it good , but there repetitive quality got my nerves little .	-1

mccabe mrs. miller often talked one list director robert altman seventies films takes cinematic genre ( namely western ) subverts it point making it seem like attack its cinematic precedents . traditional western gung-ho heroism nowhere evidence , it seems , mccabe mere parody hero director invites audience laugh . if this case , than mccabe mrs. miller would , best , looked upon satirical look-back cinematic tastes fifties . self-congratulatory " how far we've come ...

i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1

gremlins 2 should definately considered superior sequel . everything this movie top notch b-flicks usually not case . even critics who despised first gremlins gave this movie good reviews . so much creativity put into this film it surprises me spielburg didn't return project(joe dante return ) . everything character development , stage settings , music , overall story well thought out you tell actors enjoyed playing their parts good time set . gremlins 2 no means takes itself too seriously . first portion movie gives you impression it rushed though it doesn't end up way . four characters including gizmo return first gremlins gremlins themselves designed bit differently though it definately better . regarding my comment creativity this movie , you must see it yourself . this gremlins sequel ( superior sequel , mind you ) gets dvd treatment it deserves like terminator 2 terms bonus features ( okay , terminator 2 alot more but you get my point ) . each feature worth viewing there also some easter eggs a.k.a hidden features . first i hoped gremlins 3 but i don't see how it would rank up this one . even if you happened not care much first gremlins , you still should give gremlins 2 look . i honestly know someone who didn't care too much gremlins but told me they really enjoyed sequel	1

this movie came recommended someone who my opinion wouldn't brains appreciate it ! i'm grateful him turning me one most perfect little gems movie come years . i rank it right up there station agent , quiet , small picture very little plot oh , so much heart soul ! if you like film takes its own sweet time unfold , letting you come ride , then get this one . if you're looking car chases gunfire special effects all those other big-box-office necessities , then stay away leave this those us who value beauty	1
public enemy one big three original gangster films " little caesar " " scarface " . i call it one first true talkies because true dramatic acting employed all characters none dramatic posturing gesturing common before . also , much effect made presence sound itself , such frequent gunplay especially last scene cagney character " homecoming " sound song " i'm forever blowing bubbles " playing background victrola phonograph . film screenplay received film only academy award nomination , based upon novel " beer blood " . however , film wasn't given best picture nomination , nor cagney nominated best actor his portrayal gangster tom power . this film released approximately same time little caesar making star out edward . robinson . cagney character scarier two gangsters , though , because cagney came across more physical than robinson . " public enemy " one first gangster pictures talk " whys " crime well specific criminal activity . case lead character tom power , root causes clearly included doting mother brutish father . specific criminal actions shown film , these largely borrowed actual events biographies gangsters earl weiss charles o'banion , rewritten screen accomodate script . james cagney spot-on portrayal murderous thug role made him star . unfortunately , it also typecast him gangster duration 1930 . combination hays code his oscar winning performance " yankee doodle dandy " finally began diversify roles he played . aside , such well-made film , i spot one particularly " ed wood " worthy moment . clearly after prohibition started , tom his partner crime loading beer into truck they then force speak-easies around town . there huge sign building marked " brewery " . today , would like house sign it reading " meth manufactured here " , inviting quick visit authorities . if you enjoy this film , you might find " warner gangsters collection " better value since it not only this film but also includes " little caesar " four other movies	1
man , some my all-time favorite skits this wonderful compilation here . some reason , monty python crew decided re-do skits , so instead their original form , skits slightly different sets costuming , but ( thankfully ) masterful dialogue not altered any way . i guess crew felt original skits weren't 100% true their vision , so they made few changes match their original intent . one many stand-outs dirty hungarian phrasebook , where poor hungarian man thinks he asking cigarettes when he says , " drop your panties sir william . " marriage counselor who flirts man wife because man sissy anything it . still accountant who wants liontamer , provided lions aren't much different anteaters . course you'd expect classics like dead parrot sketch , nudge , nudge , lumberjack song , last but not least upper-class twit-of-the-year , which happens appropriate finale . my personal favorite sketch expedition mt . kilamarjaro , where john cleese sees two everything unless he covers up one his eyes . i also get kick out sketch where people fall out high buildings . this movie here contains best writing some best comedians ever walk earth . it real treasure every sense word	1
i looking billy elliot more than two years . i heard it should very good or even excellent film reason watching it i seen several working title films before ( boy , notting hill , love actually , four weddings funeral ) i found all them much more sincere emotional than average hollywood products . also these british films something offer you rarely find hollywood movies : charming heartwarming mixture sweet funny comedy inspiring touching drama . last month , finally , i found tape . very first moments movie my eyes riveted screen when movie ended feelings emotions overflowed me . billy elliot my opinion billy elliot brilliant movie , easily one best movies year most likely current decade . director movie stephen daldry brought us exceptional , truly inspiring moving , emotional poignant movie . entire story all characters completely believable atmosphere small provincial town somewhere north-eastern england skillfully captured transmitted us . sometimes movie sad , sometimes it funny but stephen daldry work never leave you indifferent . story occurs small coal-mining town 1984 there signs severe depression all over town . you see all around shadow distress even poverty . some simple but incredibly powerful scenes bring us sad feeling hopelessness even despair . there big coalminers strike town but it easy see it also hopeless strike . but all this only masterfully recreated background main story title character , twelve years old boy . he recently lost his mother both his father elder brother striking coalminers . billy forced his father attend boxing classes one day accidentally he see girl ballet classes occur same room he find ballet much more interesting than hated stupid boxing . so he attends those ballet classes instead boxing there nothing surprising after few weeks his father suddenly finds out billy didn't attend boxing worst all he attending ballet classes . main conflict occurs . billy must fight his choice , fight against his own family . there two stereotypes against him . first one ballet girls , not boys ( lads football ... or boxing ... or wrestling ) . second sounds even worse : all male ballet dancers gays . billy not but no one his family except aged grandma want even heard ballet . there only two people whole town , who support him - middle-aged ballet teacher mrs. wilkinson his friend michael , who same age billy who found he possibly gay . this gay subplot easily became conservative audience very controversial question . but fact such stereotypes not invented director movie if you would try learn more this terrific picture you found jamie bell , who took dance lessons age six , suffered similar sneers taunts . billy problem he must fight not only against bad obstacles misunderstanding but also against strong social stereotypes . several brilliant come scenes bright humor greatly emphasize struggles main hero . jamie bell playing billy best performances ever among young actors . his performance ( particularly dance sequences ) so genuine , bright sincere all time we easily feel expression young boy , not director , choreographer or writer . bafta award best actor year well-deserved it pity conservatism academy too often becomes insuperable obstacle many great movies . julie walters ( academy nomination best supporting actress ) billy ballet teacher also great job talented woman talented women who forced teach small provincial town pitiful salary . chemistry teacher student great line billy elliot . two other important supporting characters - billy father elder brother tony also excellent their evolution perfectly showed stephen daldry direction . beautiful soundtrack perfect combination classic ( including nice reference great swan lake ) modern music . original " " rating shouldn't mislead you . except strong language it should easily pg-13 . but this very rare case where some strong language profanity necessary authenticity characters understanding . movie suitable teens it definitely able give some good lessons them . 10 out 10 looks well deserved . thanks reading sorry my bad englis	1

melville farr ( dirk bogarde ) , married highly respected barrister verge making qc , becomes embroiled homosexual blackmail plot when youth he befriended arrested commits suicide . farr attempts track down expose blackmailers , much distress his secretly gay acquaintances colleagues , farr his wife forced confront his own ambiguous sexuality ... i hunted this film down because it came up time again reviews discussions " brokeback mountain " i wanted see what all fuss . it apparently pivotal moment history british cinema , first movie use word " homosexual " let alone pitch argument against britain anti-sodomy laws . that all bit irrelevant - almost comical - these days , certainly no reason bother watching this unless you're particularly interested film history . what struck me , however , what prompts me recommend this film , way it still stands up dramatic thriller even today . it beautifully paced , finely crafted terms shooting editing , writing marvellously fresh . it feels almost contemporary . way opening thirty minutes unfold short course screenwriting : just enough information revealed keep you engaged , while enough held back make it intriguing . duration it remains true demands mystery plot . never becoming just social essay , it almost completely resists urge preach audience , notwithstanding controversial topic . my only reservation around ending - laura final decision strikes me both too needy too generous quite credible . but overall this excellent film	-1

it difficult review this movie without comparing it " postman always rings twice " ( tpart ) . that because both based same novel james cain . i heard " tpart " years before i finally saw it first time earlier this year . my impression it good movie but , waited anxiously so long see it , it something let down . last night i tired looked forward watching good movie . i chose " ossessione " but almost changed my mind when i saw it based " tpart " . after all , i'd recently seen didn't think it such great story see again so soon . fortunately , i gave movie try quickly absorbed into it . what seperates " obsessione " " tpart " quality acting excellence directing . there feeling this movie lacking john garfield/lana turner version . we seem know what everyone thinking feeling without depending obvious dialogue . there series scenes , example , involving character name spangnolo who becomes involved gino , male lead . there any number ways you interpret him his relationship gino . fellow vagabonds political theorist his understudy homosexual lovers . visconti gives us so many subtle hints it up viewer decide themselves ( disappointedly , i assumed latter relationship ) . way everyone interacts one so impressively passions they emote really reach out touch us . fact it italian doesn't hurt its ' passionate nature . i theory foreign language movies ; they require your constant attention since you don't want risk missing critical subtitle . result , we come away more focussed every aspect movie this tends make good movies even better . i don't want disparage " tpart " since it good movie . however , " ossessione " stands so much taller so many ways i'm not sure i'll ever feel need watch " tpart " again . take praise " ossessione " rather than knock " tpart "	1

i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1

almost 2 hours long . film filmmaking . narcissistic view movie business . film film shot , ends when this accomplished . we see what goes daily lives those involved work , director ( same truffaut ) producer , cast , stuntman . there curious lady , wife one employees , who sits knitting watching her husband so he doesn't cheat her during work . everybody keeps busy working flirting chaotically , only one who not mix work pleasure seems director ( maybe producer ) . it supposed funny , even nostalgic . there visual references great classic directors film history , how film industry changed ... one thing learn this story fiction plays role our lives : it serves contrast frivolity emptiness our real lives . " you think story woman who falls her father-in-law still interesting today ? " , asks reporter leading star . question quite revealing what our world become . sex alcohol keep these pitiful troupe working like gasoline keeps car running . important moment when knitting lady ( mentioned before ) gets tired watching so much promiscuity going around starts yelling whole crew . what role she play ? she typical conservative fun-spoiler ? or she truffaut alter-ego ? hard say . that one reason why this whole film pointless . it just describes what goes , which not interesting all , there no plot , there no interesting characters , only adults acting children acting adults . scene director assistant , sexy gal , after one female workers runs away stuntman leaves her lover , says " i could leave man film , but never film man " , which doesn't make her any more likeable me . least if it only 60 or 80 minutes film i would given it 3 stars . film empty pointless its characters .	-1

koreans honor their greatest military hero this epic drama which takes place late 1500s . career tactics this admiral still studied u.s. naval academy , doubtless those other nations . screenplay based couple novels , so there some fiction , but life yi soon shin well documented , so there plenty fact supporting story . if you not familiar korean drama , it good keep mind this not hollywood product , but they very well special effects such considering non-hollywood budgets involved , it easy see past all enjoy tale told . it long series , but presents epic power , depth dimension well worth watching it unfold through each every episode . it would great also see kbs make other dramas available viewing through amazon , such " seoul 1945 " .	1
finally , i get my first chance see this brigitte lin so many martial arts film fans keep talking . she beautiful , delicate , absolutely deadly lien , mysterious assassin raised wolves later trained martial arts . or without white hair , she all but untouchable battle . only real problem she wrong side fight , serving elite assassin evil cult led , uh , unique brother-sister pairing attacks eight clans . cho yi-hang ( leslie cheung ) designated successor current master wu tang clan , which makes him de facto future leader united eight clans . he doesn't really cherish role , though ; fact , he doesn't even see real reason fight until such time cult actually acted against eight clans some way . when battle finally joined , cho dishonors his master his kinsmen taking off enemy elite assassin . he thinks two them start new life themselves elsewhere , leave fighting dying others , basically escape their obviously precarious situation - but there always repercussions such bold actions this . this especially true when you fail honor promise you made utmost earnestness . there less fighting action than you might expect - but it always treat when lien shows up . she literally makes mincemeat out her enemies nothing more than strong rope ; i mean , this girl just wicked fast , she would just soon snap your head off look you - although , it must said cho manage see more her than any other man ever lived tell . obviously , there romantic element story ; it sort romeo juliet star-crossed lovers theme , except montagues capulets never went so far go around beheading each other . romantic dimension actually rather subtle , any viewers who miss full impact revelations toward end may well wonder how this could considered much love story all . director ronny yu bride white hair beautiful film , but i must admit i felt it lacked certain vitality ; picture always seem somewhat cloudy some indistinct kind way , making print look older than it ( film released 1993 ) . still , perhaps real beauty film its ability succeed multiple levels . naturally , there obvious martial arts romantic themes , but this movie also offers up intriguing study good evil , particular , one personal responsibility toward others both sides conflict	-1

elementary school kid during ' 50s , i still remember " duck cover " song . " atomic cafe " excellent look into past see just how dangerous new technology when expected benefits exaggerated known hazards considered insignificant . i remember article how nuclear power plants would provide us so much energy we would pay monthly flat rate $25 unlimited power . no one foresaw three mile island or chernobyl . only real voice questioned our headlong rush into nuclear age producers science-fiction movies because , 1950s , any politician or scientist who questioned our nuclear policy condemned communist .

james cagney scores coup his role tom powers movie called public enemy , which chronicles rise fall tom powers within criminal element . tom sidekick , matt doyle , played well edward woods . decision move cagney into leading role let matt doyle played edward woods works very well this picture . movie begins early 1900s when tom matt already up no good young street thugs . theft , making people fall down , con jobs routine parts their juvenile world . movie progresses see tom matt into early adult lives when they eventually move up gangster world chicago . they also switch " employers ; " they go working peanuts putty nose ( murray kinnell ) making big money working big mobster paddy ryan ( robert emmett o'connor ) . public enemy great job displaying effects tom lifestyle members his household . tom brother mike , played so ably donald cook , acts very convincingly show his disdain his brother involvement organized crime . tom mother , played beryl mercer , remains blissfully unaware tom involved quite so deeply mob . jean harlow only actor this film who could used more plot ; her part good one but not great one . look jean playing gwen allen , love interest tom partway through picture . she acts wonderfully . film direction william wellman shines through all way through picture . most graphic violence what we never see -- instead camera pans away show reaction matt face when tom kills somebody , or camera focuses record playing victrola when death come . other reviewers note this enhances seriousness violence -- they right . excellent ! sound quality excellent 76 year old film ; cinematography excellent . characters well framed within camera only off center when it enhances quality scene . dvd bonus features only add this terrific experience . particular i liked 20 minute extra entitled beer blood . this extra focuses jimmy cagney how he participated making this classic movie . newsreel shorts reflect good judgment they greatly enhance overall experience watching this movie . i highly recommend this film fans jimmy cagney . people who enjoy films organized crime consider public enemy classic , too .	1

warning : movie spoiler below !!! i confess my primary reason buying copy this film , grounded recent history . i around early 80s , when . ron hubbard his scientologists going full-bore logistics making book into movie ( hero depicted original edition paperback looked like chuck norris , or so i thought ) , when all sudden hubbard died , whole project apparently fell apart . back then , i close 20 years old i curious whatever it these scientologists turned supposed help improve person quality life ... then i read larry wollersheim 1985 lawsuit . you figure rest out yourself . anyhow , oh , yeah , movie ... storyline your basic alien invasion number , i.e. , invaders arrived make life miserable poor humans ( this film , aliens look lot like klingons star trek ) , until your typical dashing young male hero organizes band his fellow humans rise up tell invaders get off our planet . pretty simple straightforward , but hey , there other films much worse than battlefield earth , they've taught me if you good enough special effects , even lamest sci-fi storylines work ! thing stood out this film , though , its reliance everyday talk contemporary cliches much its dialogue , result , it came across rather corny ... film recommended its comedy value , rather than things like epic space battle scenes . also , " bad guy " aliens use some sort psychic power interfere minds their human subjects , order keep them organizing revolts ... i must say , trying depict mind-manipulation effects film pretty much same thing movie varnish stripper when applied cd --- it turns it into confusing , incomprehensible mess ! couple times , picture would break up into concentric blur , i'd wonder what heck supposed going . how makers this film ever talked great studio like warner help them film it , something which forever remain mystery me . i remember just before this picture opened , group scientologists trying hype it : " oh , watch --- this film going bigger than star wars gone wind combined ! " you guess what happened when those staggeringly huge box office numbers never materialized ... you say " oops "	-1

i love it when two my favorite actors movie together . when one off screen , you other keep you entertained . when they're screen together , it movie-making its best . plot itself leaves bit desired . film production stop-and-go so long , i heard director changed direction before it finished . my guess some what lost what missing movie , particularly regards understanding benicio character properly . nonetheless , tommy lee jones benicio del toro shine throughou t.p.s. animal lover , i love two leads movie pro-animal too	-1

first time i saw this film back high school , over 20 years ago . time we thought this craziest movie we ever seen whoever it who written script made such off wall film somewhat insane himself . yet , we hysterically laughing throughout entire film . upon watching movie again , years later , nothing changed . i still found myself laughing throughout entire movie . it just off-beat before . it great cult classic i would definitely recommend this film others	-1
i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1

this film parody " most dangerous game " ( 1996 ) [ says , tla video ] john woo ( yes , him ) " hard target " ( 1993 ) [ " pest " ( 1997 ) most closely resembles " hard target " , which win awards academy science fiction , fantasy horror films , usa ] . it most likely inspired adapts both films -- both serious films while this farce satire . perhaps not politically correct if analyzing those " quacky " karaoke scenes ? some would say too much emphasis bodily humor , but this film hunting -- outdoors -- where men ( women ) squat use pheremones [ " father , i feel funny " ] attract prey ! john leguizamo vs . jean-claude van damme ? it get any funnier ? it goes shelf next " beyond therpay " " sibling rivalry "	1

please note -- this movie receives one star only because amazon not offer zero star ( or , more appropriately this film , negative ) rating . recently , entertainment weekly compiled list " 25 worst movie sequels " ever . how " american werewolf paris " avoided its rightful place this list now one great mysteries my life . like everyone else drawn this unfortunate attempt film , i watched because i am fan john landis ' original " american werewolf . " watched , , 15 minutes ... which more than enough time establish this ' sequel ' should stillborn during pre-production . i almost tempted follow this ' film ' its conclusion , see exactly how bad it could get , but i simply could not subject myself such torture . only thing could make this worse movie ? viewing original " werewolf " first , which emphasize even more tragedy " american werewolf paris . " so , why this such terrible movie ? i should taken dvd case description sign -- it explained i would watching ( i'm paraphrasing ... but pretty close ) ' rockin ' horror film ' hip , up coming group young actors , ' , even better , i would treated ' soundtrack complete hottest today music . ' umm ... no . i challenge you find more blatant lies than ones offered movie promoters . wit , sample several idiotic scenes plot devices :( 1 ) tom everett scott wants prove his courage bungy jumping off eiffel tower ... which would fine , except , given shape particular structure ( going out top bottom ) , our young hero would jumping into tower itself . might problem , but one he never seems consider . we really like protagonist this stupid ? ( 2 ) just before he ready leap , young woman throws herself off ledge . t.e. scott jumps save her ( despite fact his rope not yet harnassed ) , gracefully nabs her just before she becomes splatter sidewalk . she runs off , he ( hey , i right ! ) bangs his head beam put hospital . after waking , his concern her understandable ... but why , any rational universe , would he suddenly infatuated clearly suicidal woman ? he says something effect she ' different ' or ' sophisticated ' or some other garbage ... despite fact their relationship point comprises all eight ( wordless ) seconds . ( here , i'm also bit nitpicky ... because i can't life me fathom why he would julie delpy even remotely attractive ; mental instability bad enough , but her looks hardly negate those problems ) . anyway , absolutely no lucid reason , he suddenly decides this girl his dreams ... entire movie based his inexplicable admiration , flaw symptomatic entire plot structure . ( 3 ) classic scene : young lovers ' first date ... which he ' accidentally ' pulls out handful condoms , subdue her anxiety his intentions , he forced pretend they actually pieces gum . yes , this level sophistication clearly rampant throughout movie . those high points first ten minutes , i'm fairly certain rest narrative downhill atrocious beginning .	-1

i'm happy this dvd my collection . director robert siodmak pioneer " noir " , but this straight-forward suspense story , one my favorites . it film debut rhonda fleming , she quite good . elsa lanchester again cute , ethel barrymore received oscar nomination her performance . year later , dorothy mcguire would receive her only oscar nomination " gentleman agreement " . mcguire , indeed , covers this complex role completely , without speaking word . i most impressed . film one my favorite suspense fims 40 . i'm not sure why anyone can't enjoy chills .	1
simple words , easy rider probably most morally detestable film i ever seen . my impression hippies before seeing this movie , they more or less just lazy(but peaceful)people . now hippies kinda disturb me . beginning film when they stopped some food commune it clear director wanted me sympathize hippies . i personally , however , could not felt anymore different . there kids running around everywhere not watched , while adults irresponsibly thought only themselves , wether meant engaging immoral behavior such taking swim naked or doing drugs . odd thing though while drugs never exactly glamorized ( though frequently heros this ) , swimming naked treated if innocent children play . seriously grossed me out . how could something so lustful dirty , thought like ? hippies just plain creepy . also its kind hard get around thae main characters . these guys nothing more than no good drug smuggling degenerates . yet they sad excuse movie place heros . director or one cast members i believe , making easy rider , compared two main characters john wayne . but if john wayne ever played hero lowesome these one , movie would just simple not any fun . problem this movie south . they potrayed nothing , but lowesome biggots . their hatred hippies unrealistically comes out no where . now i'll admit there people like this , but generalize entire south , unfair . ultimately though i would say worse part this movie , where they lsd trip apostles creed(a catholic prayer ) recited . strong practing catholic , this could not more offensive . i leave room after half way through scene it disturbed me so much . i returned once it over , though frankly i wish i never seen it first place . everything this scene represents what i hate society . hatred religion expressed not very peaceful or loving . long story short , this movie immoral they com e.p.s. i dont think i ever look my steppenwolf cds or records same way again	-1

movie : i finally got around watching one asian cinema finest classics , ringo lam " city fire . " i must say i really impressed . film starts off little shaky ground but soon gains its footing takes off when chow character ( also named chow ) reluctantly goes undercover . i really like scenes where he first tailed then actually * hunted * rival cops who seem want nothing short him dead . ending just incredible , not just fireworks , but way loyalty plays out . film worth watching just last 30 minutes , although rest also well-paced part girlfriend thing little boring but add dimensions chow character , thanks chow yun-fat good acting . dvd : i know i'm not purist when it comes foreign films , i usually don't like subtitles ( esp . chop suey subtitles ) , so forgive me saying i actually liked dubbing job this one . there no chinese soundtrack this all , just english dub . i thought voice actors pretty good job , much better than any other dubbed foreign film i've seen . adr remix also really good , they even english song worked into nightclub scene . i'm usually turned off high-pitched cacophonous audio effects hong kong films , but american remix engineers very nice job pairing surround sound audio great visual experience ringo lam given us	1

jack nicholson knew no one could ever equal masterpice polanski " chinatown " so he didn't try . what he make when he took over this troubled production robert towne ( polanski still claims he re-write much chinatown ) visually beautiful portrait 1948 los angeles boom meditation past how it haunts us . smoke ring filled opening peggy lee " don't smoke bed " jo stafford " haunted heart " end , nicholson frames colorful orange blues 1948 los angeles against darker internal memories past . gittes successful p.i. who works divorce cases plays golf . l.a. county filled orange groves created water so sought after " chinatown .

" this one you don't want miss . it really terrific must see nicholson fans .	1

" looker " very stylish film always one my favorite michael crighton efforts ( even better than " westworld " ) i would rated it solid 4 stars if it weren't this * terrible * transfer job they i t.t he problem not clarity , color or sound -- it film gate . they must used absolute worst machine world , because image constantly moves even during static scenes . if you watch this small ( 26 " or smaller ) set it may not bother you , but anything larger drive you crazy , i assure you . which terrible shame , because this little sleeper film ( it went almost unnoticed when released ) worth seeing . it contains one crighton favorite themes -- tech misused or gone out control -- great albert finney giving rare performance adventure hero . my advice -- definitely don't buy this film . rent it netflix give it watch , particularly if you don't nice big screen tv . perhaps if when this released high def they'll much better job ( then it would indeed worth buy )	-1

andrei rublyov ( 1969 ) andrei tarkovsky my number 1 ( shares tarkovsky zerkalo ) film all time . it pinnacle film-making me - one few most visually beautiful films well one deepest films ever . beauty every frame exquisite - i pause film very often just admire i t.t here only couple more films touched me profoundly andrei rublyov . i am always surprised hear it very slow film - tarkovsky , it very well paced , i am never tired its 3+ hours running time . film based life 15-th century monk icon painter andrei rublyov who wanders through country torn barbarism , later tatar invaders . tarkovsky explores several very important topics his film : what talent how artist responsible it ? man god , artist power . final 20 minutes film best most inspiring i've seen cinema . me , last chapter film , " bell " perhaps greatest its emotional impact piece cinema ever made . i can't stay calm collected when i see it . boriska sobbing like child after his bell rings - he child , boy , lonely lost ; andrei breaking his vows silence , his words boriska hope , many roads they would walk together . andrei icons we finally allowed behold admire , their breathtaking divine beauty serenity , their melodic lines pure joyful colors , faces saints angels their eternal mystery , quiet knowledge sadness , looking inside themselves inside our very souls ; music literally takes you somewhere above this earth , heights such purity beauty you could hardly breath where even " swiftest birds " pain death can't reach you ...	1

like most people , i ridiculed riverdance everything like . but working store sold this , i absolutely floored how awesome michael flatly feet flames . this not compared river dance or lord dance ( precurors feet flames ) . this much more show ; kind like difference cirque du soleil saltimbanco quidam . production value skyrockets makes anything else ( before it ) look archaic . feet flames showcases more than just celtic-style dancing . there musical numbers both female duo solo singer . there some sort story involved but i never focused too much it . dancing fantastic . while show geared around michael flatly skills , he allow his other dancers some spotlight . interviews/making-of quite insightful . who would though flatly loses several pounds ( water/sweat ) during each performance ? it wild show showcases just how profitable ' riverdancing ' . sheer energy show , performers even crowd make you want dance it	-1

i loved mortal kombat , i thought sequel would carry great kombat legacy . i heartily dissapointed when i saw annihilation . brian johnson cool khan , but some special effects so fake i laugh . robin shou returns liu kang , savior earth . after killing shang tsung , group heads home when all sudden , emperor busts up party sends his minions down . there , khan makes his first appearance , his abnormal , yet awesome soldiers . johnny cage killed , rayden(now played james remar)fights khan , winning but sacrificing johnny cage . now , earth seven days before it destroyed . what i didn't like this movie appearances people who died first film , like scorpion sub-zero . who heard sub-zero brother . thing got me how liu kang fighting got worse since first film . he losing every battle , except end , even then he wasl osing . not get this film if you want avoid dissapointment	-1
mortal kombat : annihilation one those films so bad it actually hurts watch it . nearly complete recast almost all characters ( odd , considering interviews after first movie , all them said they'd want/ willing come back sequel ) , horrible ( even 1997 standards ) cg effects , cliched fight scenes ( gee ... two women mud pit . i bet it took them all night come up one ) , virtually everything could gone wrong this movie go wrong this movie . loosely based story mortal kombat 3 video game ( set immediately after first movie , which , while not great , looks like citizen kane compared this stinkburger ) , movie set lofty goal depicting shao khan ( played brian thompson , alien bounty hunter x-files ) his army ( shown most scenes small band extras . oooh ... scary . ) they attempt take over earth merging it alternate dimension known outworld . this merging realms result destruction humanity . only week anything it , lord raiden ( played james remar , replacing , i can't believe i'm saying this , much better christopher lambert role ) once again enlists help liu kang ( robin shou ) , sonia blade ( sandra hess ) , princess kitana ( talisa soto ) , help select few other characters video games ' crowded lineup , prevent this happening . story itself not necessarily bad . however , given film obviously low budget weak screenplay , loss most excellent cast first film , most jarringly , direction even more inept than paul w.s. anderson , it quickly becomes clear they set their sights too high , only practically everything come crashing down . only saving grace this film its killer soundtrack , featuring updated version theme created first movie , well music kmfdm , megadeth , rammstein , juno reactor , others . if ever you're looking punish yourself something , then all means watch this movie . however , if you actually like yourself want remain good terms yourself , you avoid this movie like plague . believe me , you'll thank yourself later .	-1

i don't understand why this version cuts out key scene church sean connery stands up his pew challenges priest sermonizing against violence saying something like " what violence against miners ? " fact , they appeared purposely edited movie make audience think comment richard harris makes after service " talking back priest " refers pleasantries sean connery exchanged priest after service way out ! i remember this scene vividly since it when i saw this movie almost 40 years ago now , it cool see someone stand up church stand up church hypocrisy . cut this scene also distorts movies development close friendship priest held sean connery how each could act within their roles while retaining their bond . odd . any insight fans ? -	-1

among most ridiculous critical reactions any movie ever vicious reaction david leans film . coterie untalented hacks ( led likes pauline kael richard schickel ) bound determined tear down lean after huge financial successes his past few movies , this gorgeous meditation power forgiveness ( or lack thereof ) their victim . robert mitchum cast against type , sarah miles ( ripped into some idiots given role because she wife screenwriter robert bolt ! ) , three great character actors : leo mckern , trevor howard , oscar-winning john mills all giving spectacular performances . i admit christopher jones weak link , but if so , it only significant flaw . movie beautiful watch any you ever see , maurice jarre ( usual ) took his work up step composing score lean film . it good " brief encounter " or " lawrence arabia " ? no . but this terribly underrated movie ranks up there best rest david lean movies , including dickens adaptations or " kwai " or " zhivago " . great movie !	1

i curious see movie maniac years . huge horror fan since i child i surprised i hadn't seen it somewhere line before . however i never able find it any video stores even after dvd release . i ended up getting it netflix let me just say .... it would fully worth cost purchasing it blindly ! this truly underrated slasher/horror film , my opinion , one absolute best slasher flicks 80 , but not way one might think certainly not way i expected . i expected run-of-the-mill cheesy , ta , horror flick , which would absolutely fine me , but instead i got very gnarly , incredibly acted ( joe spinell amazing ) , horrific suspenseful , even sad horror story . i rarely so surprised good way any film . i try not give anything away , but warned i probably give away some surprises , least they my opinion . one thing i loved so much how well we get know killer . he not one-dimensional or shallow character , he complex tortured .... just guy ! i never seen killer portrayed quite this way . first half film , maybe even more , we see him his home we see him stalk kill people , we see him maniac . then suddenly halfway point , maybe little further our maniac becomes interested woman who takes his picture park . he goes her home under premise basically non-existant , which really only weak point plot might i add -- exactly how he got his foot door her , so speak . i forgive it because maybe more happened they just didn't show . anyway , point this man who we seen little more than tortured soul , murderer , lunatic , comes into this beautiful woman home completely normal . he charming , whitty , jokes her , he intelligent , thoughtful , talks her art her photography , they go date she seems genuinely like this big guy . i felt bewildered ! i already felt bad guy -- i hardly ever felt such sympathy " bad guy " like this but boy i this case his interactions this lady make it all more sad , seeing he fact okay , least time . anyhow , withour revealing much more than which i so excited , this movie avoids lot typical horror cliches right up end which nice . i wish it not ended so abruptly , but hey , i can't ask much more this one ! effects very well . this savini his best -- some work here even better than his work dead movies , which me , saying lot . if you fan 80s horror , or any slasher/horror you would well check this movie out . it dramatic , creepy , chilling ( especially savini cameo scene -- yikes ! ) , sad . more layers my opinion than most movies its kind . :	1

first off this film not color . its not torture slasher film . dont fooled lame cheesey packaging . its bw 30s/40s dracula/frankenstien castle type film but executed amazing skill . it goes extra mile then some . sound look plot all within classic hokey range - but brilliance true gift horror . i dont know if i saw les baxter version ( whoever sound it awesome ! ) . but i love les baxter so now i go back make sure i see his version . im not familiar barbara steele ( sorry ) but her performance phenomenal .	1
my experience , seeing words " national lampoon " any film title bad omen , indicating tastelessness dearth actual comedy up ahead . national lampoon gold diggers manages take series all-time low - which , sadly , no mean feat . friedle chris owen act if they auditioning future installment dumb dumber , plot suffers definite " ick " factor - , sadly , those actually movie strengths . calvin ( friedle ) leonard ( owen ) grew up together orphanage now trying make their mark world young adults . they certainly don't want work living , so they take up life petty crime . they pitiful failures this wind up jail . then , two old ladies they accosted street bail them out invite them visit their impressive home . guys ( which i mean calvin , he only one really capable actual human thought ) think their hosts rich , so it they devise plan marry them , wait their imminent deaths , then live large their inheritances . doris ( louise lasser ) betty mundt ( renee taylor ) may heirs mundt prophylactics fortune , but they fact cash poor ( thanks their insane uncle , who charge mundt estate ) . they make their own plans marry two young men , purchase sizable insurance policies them , then kill them . double wedding takes place , marriages consummated ( i hear yuck !? ) , month passes . calvin finds married life buxom , not-dead-yet doris driving him insane , so he leonard begin setting " accidental " traps their wives ; naturally , women finalizing their own murder plans same time . mr. mrs. smith , this ain't - but goes without saying . i won't lie say i didn't laugh or smile time or two because i , but national lampoon gold diggers aims low - really low - cannot begin escape black hole stupidity upon which it built . i think i speak vast majority human beings when i say we just don't want see senior citizen women prancing around onscreen like victoria secret models . there crude then there national lampoon crude , gold diggers crude it gets . this film should all rights career killer anyone involved it - although nikki ziering may emerge relatively unscathed given fact her screen time severely limited	-1
i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1
old silent film course classic . it comes german school horror films 1920s . it adaptation bram stoker dracula , but it takes liberties original . it situated bremen not london . his girlfriend or wife quite rightly mina . rensfield boss real estate agency . trip dracula castle standard . dracula voyage bremen also very standard . real change comes end when mina sacrifices herself giving herself dracula keep him active up after [ .. ] crows . then he dies everyone saved . naive rewriting ending into some palatable cathartic compensation horror life : salvation possible escape real eventuality . but it also very christian ending way , or isn't it jewish after all ? woman sacrificing herself sake social group menaced dracula . this sacrifice epiphanic since it brings salvation . this fantastic horror period german cinema seems longing happy ending , just if reality germany then so bleak happiness could only dream consolation or solace cinema could propose people . film though admirable quality pictures shooting . black white film such subject could easily become drab , which it never . pictures always innovative way or contrast or composition makes poor technique days quite able translate complex situations . acting these silent actors also quite admirable body language they use never overdone which would make it grotesque . it just expressive enough mean what it supposed mean without any negative second level reading . dr jacques coulardeau , university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne	1
sometimes you see movie such great acting it , you never forget it . i can't imagine anyone playing dian fossey other than sigourney ; throughout whole movie , you feel her rage , her loneliness , her determination . i also think this movie good job not making dian look like angel , because devoted she , she her flaws . years isolation remote mountains africa hardened her . sometimes i think it would better if instead endlessly fighting hunters , she changed her approach helped give them job oppurtunities so they other ways make money besides hunting . however , despite her flaws , dian fossey still deserves recognized remembered her selfless efforts protect gorillas . this movie just	-1

" my left foot " well-detailed biography author , writer artist christy brown , born athetoid cerebral palsy . brown life story told flashback form documented detailed fashion ; centering around christy struggle dealing severity his physical condition while , through support his loving caring family ( which included some 22 siblings all , thirteen siblings surviving ) , making himself rather well-known outstanding writer , painter poet . christy brown never regarded man trapped inside prison twisted , contorted body , but man who could show entire universe just exactly what he became capable doing - giving abundance love , hope faith through genius his talents . boyhood ( when christy first snatched piece chalk his sister hand using his only mobile foot ) manhood ( when christy turned world its collective ear never saying never refusing give up spite his condition , letting his masterworks speak themselves ) , brown life worthwhile journey , everyone , disabled or not , profit his experiences . so much offer , it not hard see why " my left foot "' two main actors ( daniel day-lewis brenda fricker ) received academy award nominations their outstanding work one best movies 1989 . after seeing this film several times now , i often wonder why hugh o'conor performance ( young christy ) became overlooked , didn't garner him any major hardware result . result day-lewis ' potrayal adult christy , it quite amusing many people convinced otherwise healthy actor himself cerebral palsy . fact , i believe it through day-lewis ' commitment dedication role ( even refusing come out character eating lunch wheelchair ) major reason why he earned well-deserved academy award . not all far behind day-lewis fricker performances , wonderfully touching portrayal ray mcanally ( who died shortly after filming ended ) christy tough-as-nails father paddy brown . conclusion , if everyone followed christy brown example he lived his forty-nine years spent earth , world would much better place which live . features this special edition dvd release , reviews good read interviews insightful . it would real treat if daniel day-lewis himself present this special edition give his account christy brown life story . hugh o'conor interview sheds least little light christy beginnings gives this dvd edition more than enough credibility making " my left foot " worthwhile necessary one dvd movie collection . video itself , although containing some noticeably visible dirt spots places , still good transfer , audio quality excellent . i can't say enough this wonderfully brilliant piece cinema ( kudos jim sheridan his excellent directing shane connaughton sheridan well-written screenplay ) , so just pick up your very own copy " my left foot " see what all fuss !	1

although not fan kenneth brannaugh , i willing give his hamlet fair viewing . since this my favorite play , i hoping film would better than his last two mediocre endeavors into shakespeare plays ; unfortunately , it worse ! beginning performances : jack lemmon wonderful actor , but here , he embarrassment , many other actors assembled , including julie christie ( whom i usually adore ) . casting all over map which makes uneven performances unsatisfying scenes . brannaugh own delivery text rushed usually unconvincing , despite vehemence which he delivers every over-ennunciated syllable , which sounds manic , bordering farce . bad direction over-indulgent acting ! it might interesting see what brannaugh would good direction , instead his own . i could go my problems staging other production values but damage this brilliant work every level not worth going depth . good news zefferelli hamlet , actor i don't normally like -- mel gibson -- spot perfect . actor excellently cast , production values direction serve text , rather than competing it , brannaugh version . zefferelli knows his shakespeare his films , my opinion represent definitive versions ( watch his romeo juliet taming shrew ) , too bad us he didn't more . too bad , also , no one contemporary seems capable . instead we get recent unwatchable junk " hip-cool " sensibilities . argh ! it not surprising no one rush produce dvd this tragedy film	-1
only good anti-communist french anti-communist ... that something i've believed since first reading raymond aron . this gallic tradition continued through bernard henry-levy now i'm adding french director regis wagnier my list ... film stars sandrine bonnaire catherine deneuve . it idealistic communists who return paris ussr 1946 help build up socialism wake wwii . what they find , instead , suffering they never imagined . film certain french quality , especially relationships ; yet , there something russian there , too . filmed kiev , it really looks russian , even when faces seem french . fear , paranoia , suspicion -- even dancing men red army chorus -- all very russian . what missing little bit russian warmth , which somehow found even most shocking russian films . french bit more cerebral rational , i guess . but picture packs wallop , all same . i won't spoil it revealing plot . least it happy ending ( really russian movie , hero would shot , i would think ) . it really , really good . i recommend it . add it your own netflix queue -- or buy it amazon ..	1

it difficult review this movie without comparing it " postman always rings twice " ( tpart ) . that because both based same novel james cain . i heard " tpart " years before i finally saw it first time earlier this year . my impression it good movie but , waited anxiously so long see it , it something let down . last night i tired looked forward watching good movie . i chose " ossessione " but almost changed my mind when i saw it based " tpart " . after all , i'd recently seen didn't think it such great story see again so soon . fortunately , i gave movie try quickly absorbed into it . what seperates " obsessione " " tpart " quality acting excellence directing . there feeling this movie lacking john garfield/lana turner version . we seem know what everyone thinking feeling without depending obvious dialogue . there series scenes , example , involving character name spangnolo who becomes involved gino , male lead . there any number ways you interpret him his relationship gino . fellow vagabonds political theorist his understudy homosexual lovers . visconti gives us so many subtle hints it up viewer decide themselves ( disappointedly , i assumed latter relationship ) . way everyone interacts one so impressively passions they emote really reach out touch us . fact it italian doesn't hurt its ' passionate nature . i theory foreign language movies ; they require your constant attention since you don't want risk missing critical subtitle . result , we come away more focussed every aspect movie this tends make good movies even better . i don't want disparage " tpart " since it good movie . however , " ossessione " stands so much taller so many ways i'm not sure i'll ever feel need watch " tpart " again . take praise " ossessione " rather than knock " tpart "	1
this 2003 remake " monte walsh " tom selleck third ( but hopefully not last ) western tnt , it probably most stirring film tribute end old west cowboy way life . this saying quite bit some fine westerns like " wild bunch " , " shootist " , ( even more recently ) " open range " well other movies dealt changes resulting progress u.s. enter twentieth century . other reviewers covered plot line great detail already , so i won't retread ground . suffice it say , while selleck monte walsh hero picture , he portrayed character flaws intact well . montelius walsh loves three things life : horses , women , drinking ( order these things changes different times his life ) . he stubborn , afraid commit martine ( his favorite prostitute whom he seem love ) , refuses change . he also hard-working loyal his friends , especially his best buddy chet ( played keith carradine ) , these qualities what make his character heroic storyline affecting . i'm convinced if selleck starred primarily westerns throughout his film career , then his movie success would dwarfed his " magnum p.i. " role . tnt westerns , his three previous westerns dating back 1979 " sacketts " , establish him premier cowboy actor . " monte walsh " finest those efforts date , it hoped selleck ' saddle up ' again soon ; perhaps he'll even reunite sam elliott whom he starred his first two made-for-tv westerns who also made some first-rate westerns tnt . watch this one . it elegiac tribute passing old west american cowboy . may both continue live films	1

i theory : audiences getting smarter . whereas before big hollywood movie massive marketing push would've all rage , now people starting know better . they're realizing terrible movie terrible movie no matter how often we see julia roberts deal more romantic comedic mishaps or much stuff michael bay destroy . so when movie comes like john malkovich , or memento or even visually impressive like matrix , we stand up take notice . building career largely inventive music videos , first time director spike jonze comes out gate probably most unconventional comedy you'll see . loserly craig schwartz ( john cusack , always good ) aspiring puppeteer who can't get any work . then he his dishevelled looking wife lotte ( cameron diaz ) leaving their small new york apartment pets everywhere since lotte pet store worker . craig , due his puppeteering skills gets accepted company located , amusingly , 7 1/2 floor , complete cramped ceilings . he also strong attraction one his co-workers , feisty maxine ( catherine keener ) . one day while working , he discovers small day going inside he finds out he see world through john malkovich eyes 15 minutes unceromonious dump new jersey turnpike ditch . craig maxine get idea : charge 200$ people experience john malkovich which novel idea until lotte goes through feels deeper connection , especially around idea maxine . then we bizarre love square or star or something since craig loves maxine who loves lotte but only when lotte inside john malkovich ... ' head . try not wrap your head around it since it better explained movie after awhile you don't even worry stuff like vessels or portals , you just go it . casting course important no one seems wasted , even diaz , who i normally can't stand . real treat though course malkovich since times you almost can't tell if he acting or if he really quirky . then there comedy which subtle first-was-funny-but-now-it-ain't like 7 1/2 floor small ceilings but then film shows you what happens when malkovich steps through his own portal it becomes not only technical marvel but one flat-out funniest things i've seen lately . only problem story certain point it shifts gears film almost speed walks its climax rather than lurching forward , like it shot foot . like amazon review says , i don't know if film warrant repeat viewings you get more out it every time you see it but first viewing quite something	-1

all movies i've seen " set " former soviet union , this one manages best show reality . stephen rea , viktor burakov , what would interesting job forensic pathologist - except he hampered what he or say soviet dogma bureaucracy . when he learns serial killer targeting kids other vulnerables , luring them out city rape murder them , he outraged ( frightened his own children safety ) . he also determined catch this man . unfortunately , all his superiors deny possibility communism ever producing such deviant refuse give him even smallest tools help catch him . many , many years pass , burakov diligently pursues murder after murder , forced his superiors take precious time out true investigation shake down other soviet targets such homosexuals ( deemed dangerous soviets ) . finally , when communism collapses , he allowed his superior , fetisov , one man who sympathetic his mission , use modern tools such computers assigned adequate manpower stage hunt this horrible killer who piling up bodies over twenty years . all leads here , rea , sutherland , demunn , very convincing , even if their russian accents not quite right . also authentically soviet buildings , streets , extras . since burakov real enemy here stagnation apathy communism , it would inappropriate if buildings he worked , lived , or searched clean tidy well taken care . fortunately , they accurately reflect what going during death throes unworkable ideology - this bleak place exist . demunn portrays chikitilo gray passive/aggressive . he eminently overlookable which explains why , when caught first time , he released . it also explains how he lured all these kids their deaths without anyone taking notice him . while he clearly monster , there scenes which demunn manages inject humanity pathos making him seem pathetic addition evil . burakov relentless pursuit this killer despite odds what it cost him personally emotionally what make final moments movie so touching . this movie difficult watch it not shy away violence committed ( though what shown not gratuitous ) , but ultimately , it saga one man determination what right outwait apathetic regime . very satisfying	1

i always thought dustin hoffman tootsie , which i haven't seen , movie producer wag dog , which i love . or rain man , fine film . but hey , guy give us nasty edge if script calls it . hoffman became lenny bruce . bruce material great times awful others . nowadays , course , none it would shocking . film shows us bruce faults , unedited , presumably contrast great material he could produce because and/or spite his excesses . but still , something missing . something crucial . i don't know what . i only know this film could so much better .	-1

i picked this dvd off rack random selection , mainly because i don't believe sean penn ever appeared bad movie .... this got one his best ( even though he probably still teenager when it produced 1983 ) . he portrays young delinquent purse snatcher mugger named mick o'brien , who rapidly escalating violence his crimes . ultimately , during attempted drug robbery his best friend murdered he accidentally runs over young brother his bitter enemy , paco moreno ( fairly well portrayed esai morales .... he definitely no sean penn ) . because his youth , mick sent grim , grimy , violent juvenile detention center presided over " usual suspects " : inattentive , seemingly deaf guards who allow atrocities perpetrated daily no consequences .... prison trustees ( clancy brown portrays one ) who flaunt rules , sexually abuse , terrorize inmates .... warden who weak , fickle joke . standing up trustees demonstrating his talents mayhem maniacal violence , mick becomes dominant inmate .... effect , ruling place , until two things happen challenge him : paco rapes mick girlfriend ( revenge death his brother ) gets sentenced same juvenile detention center mick . they now hate each other more than ever , trapped within same hellish institution .... you know something horrific going happen . sorry , but if you want see how this incredible set-up plays out , you'll rent or buy dvd .... i assure you , it money well spent . acting superb ( sean incredible , even teenager , exuding undercurrent barely-controlled violence ); plot suspenseful bloody but always makes perfect sense ; direction , cinematography , sets , sound , etc . terrific . this genuinely excellent movie .... i give it my highest recommendation .	1
i am absolutely thrilled deluxe treatment his fine film received . even though , surface , " fly " gory fun horror film -- i long considered it important masterpiece well one greatest love stories 80 . anyone familiar cronenberg , film director , knows his work challenging , avant garde , controversial , weird , gross , brilliant -- usually all above . " dead ringers " , " naked lunch " , " crash " " history violence " all exceptional works someone defies expectations makes films he wants ! true genius , even his more minor works better than most hollywood product . " fly " relatively accessible work cronenberg , one easily enjoyed mass audience . simply put , it horror story science nature gone awry . it quite scary , quite gross , quite enjoyable . what distinguishes film , firstly , performances . jeff goldblum never better , different world he would gotten oscar nomination . geena davis perfect -- quirky beginning , but grounding film real emotional resonance end . i believe their interaction , their relationship , phenomenal love story ! how much you willing sacrifice when person you love literally falling apart ? how long you support them when their actions become insupportable . these real people , even though situation fantastical , you really feel them . what also important film context time which it released . " fly " seen many allegory aids . 1986 , major studios not making films this subject . it would while before mainstream cinema got around really addressing issue . yet here " fly " , mainstream horror movie illness . graphic degeneration body betrayed . it not hard see symbolism many issues images , cronenberg master subtext . but i don't necessarily want politicize film , just something think if you haven't contemplated it before . either way , impact film hasn't lessened me -- especially romance . please don't think " fly 2 " anything this brilliant movie ! kgharris , 9/06	1

i college when brit pop phenomena hit . but i snob back then , deeply involved my college radio station turning my nose up this tripe . oh just too mainstream commercial me like ! course i've since matured , i gave brit pop chance since then , this documentary taught me few things i otherwise didn't know . there curious phenomena takes place america uk terms pop culture . one gentleman made comment pendulum swing back forth two , certainly true now i think it . i heard stone roses , but they never caught avengence here . then , course , nirvana happened eclipsed everything else . after kurt died 94 , oasis began rise uk " grunge years " began . i heard stories all kids uk chasing after oasis their packed , sold out shows , new chapter began . this documentary concentrates mostly gallagher brothers . noel far more well spoken than liam ( but everyone knows because i don't think he spent nearly much time pickling himself ) , everything noel said seemed more meaning behind it . they interviewed few more people , such damien blur guy pulp . damien seems like real downer , they should've given guy pulp more say he seemed little more animated than blur . i liked beatles vs . rolling stones - type rivalry established against blur oasis ( seeing whose album would hit #1 first ) , but you tell they really weren't interested it creation press . plus , you got impression london swinging again like mods 60s . it little ironic they too fell into same traps we america death grunge . heroin too them their grasp ( referencing blur song " beetlebum " , it supposed heroin ) . , celebrity death ended their trip well ( ours kurt , theirs princess diana ) . here it 10 years later . blur pulp seem gone way dodo , but oasis still around . they're not hot phenomena they , but they continue make music seem staying power ( when they're not fighting or drunk/high ) . now coldplay seems one leading brit pop charge . maybe they , fact , live forever	-1

this film teaches lesson other side political isle than i usually sit , but it tells it well . it vaguely reminiscent other films 1940 but i can't remember title . it " know thy enemy " film , teaches culture clash . i'm not one respect culture if it demands it , but if it earns it i . this film two warriors get stranded together dangerously hostile world work together survive . they learn each other languages , culture way even die-hard conservative like me cannot argue . perhaps everyone learn something this . film right wrong , it change one perspective . end , i remember audience cheering theatres	-1

this movie really makes you stop think , how you live your life how others live theirs . every person life purpose . each us find out what purpose . many don't know it , but you live out your purpose still enjoy life same time , affecting other people positive . this movie almost seemed mind pessimist , but some may say realist . i think it reflects moral conscious day . i seen good number sidney poitier movies , it amazes me how he always keep poker face every tough seen ( one calling little no expression when giving someone critical information ) . he ranks right up there all leading men hollywood old , great actors back day	1
complaints this dvd release all correct . great movie , low qaulity release . yet i'm surprised no one mentioned thing angered me most , self censorship . bataan race scene where ustinov swaps bataan bottle beer . we're ok witness pirate drunk , but sports commentator saying teenager running bottle beer beyond appropriate ? what execs disney thinking ? if they need put out disclaimer leonard maltin befor showing such " questionable " material they many vault collection ... fine , but stop chopping up movies . our ten year old children not buying these movies , many us actually alive see originals no we're ripped off . stop angering loyal fan base this ignorance . keep this mind when you contemplate inevitable release cleaned up widescreen version this title	-1

george stevens masterpiece , me , best all biblical epics . it takes dramatic license setting scripture events , but it so very peaceful profound manner . script very well written , presenting scripture poetic , dramatic manner musical score superb . biblical scholars disagree over meaning matthew 16:18 passage " this rock i build my church " - here seemingly presented refer peter himself rock when true meaning most accurate translation would appear statement peter - jesus christ son living god - rock or foundation which church built . cast this film very large , cameo roles many major stars day . max von sydow exceptional actor who captures loving , caring spirit jesus . location , including four corners region us , striking background story life ministry jesus christ .	1
this high octane , pure entertainment wonderful cast including jimmy stewart june allyson . it also best footage convair b-36 peacemaker ever put into movie theater . frank lovejoy great job , but not quite imposing general curtis . lemay - person his character , no doubt , emulating . there message this motion picture terms quality people required put up very difficult positions within fledgling strategic air command . it hard work make things happen this picture dedicated character dedication those individuals who protected this country during cold war . this film would wonderful co-feature " gathering eagles " rock hudson mary peach . they're portrayed roughly eight ten years apart history sac . each time i see extradordinarily long take-off footage b-36 , i get little misty-eyed . i remember watching last b-36 it made low-level departure loring air force base , maine . , like movie , venetian blinds shuddered most other structures ! this would wonderful dvd format	1

this one my favorite movies long i remember . even when i young i didn't understand all jokes , but when i recently rewatched it ... well my love it rediscovered . this film basically takes pridictable unoriginal story two people trying succeed their sport end up falling love makes it instantly memorable its snappy dialogue fun one upmanship main characters . this film would worth it some its insults alone ! overall , i would say it diamond rough . but if you looking serious film then this might not appeal you , cutting edge pretty much fun filled romp start finish	1
i quite disappointed this film . director used some non-actors play some parts , it shows . also , editing camera work shoddy . one particular scene , you see mouchette turning her body , which causes coffee cup move toward edge table . next shot , cup falls floor . effect very self-conscious clumsy . finally , actress playing girl fails convince us her state mind occurs fim end . perhaps other viewers may like it	-1

i actually really liked this movie , i thought it fun , fairly intelligent , sexy , humorous , quite suspenseful special effects pretty good o.o kay so i am fan angela bassett james spader , they pretty hot this movie you admit ! angela plays dr kaela evers ship medical officer james ship hunky co-pilot nick vanzant who lustful eye kaela who isn't interested him much his disappointmen t.t he action takes place medical spaceship alien artefact secreted aboard miner aforesaid medical spaceship its crew rescue who unbeknown them slowly mutating into something not quite human courtesy alien artefact . there also ship computer called sweetie female persona who pretty much running show technology point view star go supernova . one one crew picked off demented miner , who mayhem his mind , soon only spader bassett left ship which danger sucked into gravitational field crumbling star there only one life pod left share it means possibility kaela nick dna merging together which it partially , they both end up one blue one green eye but miracle miracle kaela also ends up pregnant , condition she never expected ! all all it pretty good sci-fi film , shame it panned so much because it well worth watching but i noticed over years i reviewing films more intelligent sci-fi film offer , less likely it appreciated " green slime mega-blood guts " brigade i call them . you know who you guys , if it isn't gung ho no plot then you don't want know ! watch this film enjoy , if you brain your head appreciates something comes under , " intelligent " " thoughtful " , however if this too much your brain cells , give it miss watch something easier like star wars or men black , great films lots fun but totally lacking anything remotely intelligent beginning end	1
i've heard naysayers badmouth this movie , but i've never understood it . they use descriptors such " preachy " , " overly dramatic " , " self-important " , so . good grief ! what you , bait fishers ( not there anything wrong that) ? this story this man family , it truly beautiful . i guide trout fishing trips missouri , so , course , i love this movie partly fishing . this film explained my fly-fishing passion my wife more effectively than my words dragging her few fishing trips ever could . scenes filmed magnificantly such way you follow logic instinct each fisherman uses catch each fish . however , story so much more than this . story begins norman making note there never clear line religion fly-fishing his family , parallel continues throughout story his life . success fly-fisherman based knowledge , physical skill , intuition , emotion , but balance also required . balance only comes through spirituality , whether you stiving godly person , or whether you simply commune nature spiritual fashion . without balance , tangled line cause you pull your hair out . balance , even most unsuccessful fishing trip brings joy . so norman stuggles understanding his younger brother paul , who attained such miraculous balance river , but whose life away river rapidly spinning out control . end , observant viewer should recognize it paul pride eventually leads his downfall , it family failure their attempts rescue paul they continue struggle remainder their lives well . norman spends his life trying tap into god balance through fly-fishing hopes he someday understand what happened his family why . perhaps finally writing his book helped him answer few those questions . walt fulps http://www.missouritrouthunter.co	1

director kon ichikawa , known his harrowing gritty portrayal brutality war film " fires plain , " which took place philippine island leyte , during wwii , given us truly great look defeated japanese army burma close war . " burmese harp , " not unlike " fires plain " deals defeated japanese army . however , where " fires plain " shows viewer despair private tamura , film " burmese harp " gives us look into spiritual awakening one japanese soldier towards end world war two . soldier main protagonist named mizushima ( shoji yasui ) . moreover , unlike ichikawa later film " fires plain " this film not so much hellish nighmare fighting war , much it deals hellish aftermath burma campaign , how horror this tragic campaign weighs heavily conscience one japanese soldier . those you who not familiar wwii , or burma campaign ; it burma where japanese imperial army suffered greatest loss life world war ii . film , mizushima agrees go fortified mountain stronghold , where last remnants japanese soldiers holed up , refusing surrender . he inform them surrender japan , those inside lay down there arms order return japan . however , something goes terribly wrong company japanese soldiers refuse surrender . narrowly escaping death himself , mizushima decides not return his company , or japan . something changed . he nursed health priest , steals priests clothes : buddhist monk . he proceeds across burma , he sees nothing but unburied corpses dead japanese . mizushima affected seeing these unburied dead his fellow japanese countryman , symbolic death rebirth , he assumes role monk decides not return his unit pow camp , or even return japan until all his fellows soldiers buried . he begins task burying any all japanese dead he comes across his journey across burma : very formidalble task indeed ! mizushima horror seeing bodies unburied dead profound affect him , he become different person . this truly profound poignant film . considering this film released 1956 , mere 11 years after end world war two , makes this classic film which must rank right up there some greatest antiwar films all-time . this film predates " fires plain , " good 3 years . early film dealing this war , i believe this one greatest films come out japan dealing trauma wwii . especially considering directed japanese , released japan . must see , highly recommended	1
