i skeptical this one .. i learned cheaper toy .. less my baby likes it . though he absolutely adores this floor mat . i got it him when he 2 months old . he only 4 months old now but can't get enough it . little octopus make sound when it spins .. but he can't reach it yet . though its hilarious watch him try ! he gets so frustrated beats up other toys , but then smiles end when i go spin it him . i give this 5 stars because floormat itself . i would give it 4 stars but based my baby all babies different . only problems we it , which would make it 4 stars would fact aside octopus there no other sounds , there no lights . my baby loves sounds lights . so if you one those , expect yours not want play long mat beginning stages . ours plays 20-30 minutes , then he wants moved his swing so he look mirror hear music . but you get really good tummy time this it keeps them entertained laying out straight ( instead scrunched up swing so often ) so you get few things around house . oh we noticed our baby play it longer , if we go over play him every once awhile . helping him reach toys , making octopus spin , etc . then we get 20 minutes whatever . so all all ... its great product ... just warned little mirror one fish .. isn't mirror . its one those flashy material looking things baby can't see his reflection it .. cause i cant even see mine it . if toys hanging low your baby , you flip them over top bar once they hang higher , or move baby mat bit .	1

i got hovercraft my son 5th birthday , even though it recommended 8 over . it some limitations but all those described box , except battery life which really doesn't last long ( 20 minutes ) . he hasn't disappointed it when it runs out power . instructions outside box clearly say it should used ' smooth ' pavement ' calm ' water skirt should periodically checked ( it slip places times but it easy put back ) . if you don't proper conditions , i would avoid urge buy it because it just frustrate you . it little hard steer because you anticipate turn early since air ' hover ' keeps it going longer direction it already headed ( may where 8+ age group figure out ) . we many remote control toys lots disappointed us , but this one pretty good long you use it instructed don't expect things it not meant	1

created makers uno , skip bo great " lets play " feeling . it combines skill , strategy , some cases , lot luck . players try first use up all cards their stock pile playing them building piles numerical sequence , 1 through 12 . end your turn though , you must discard card one your own discard piles ( max four ) . here where you must use all your skills strategy since you able use only card top each pile combination your hand cards deplete your stock pile . cool , huh ? well it gets better ! skip bo cards act wild cards add excitement play . use them correctly you could making all these combinations while your opponents sit there watching your stock pile get smaller smaller wondering your iq must over 140 . nothing beats look their faces you turn over your last stock pile card discover it skip bo card . it like winning texas hold-em river card . ouch ! you awesome fun playing this game . even tough it game numbers ; you not sit quietly while players think . au contraire , talking , laughing making jokes just part fun . what not love this game ? deluxe edition : this edition very nice score pad , card tray game board reserved spaces designed four building piles discard piles up four players . since skip bo played up six players deluxe edition board falls little short . i believe this edition still worth buying . it perfect up four players very useful keeping place building piles if played more . great game , great edition , extremely educational lots lots fun . worthy greatest games ever made award . fun !	1

i purchased anakin skywalker model couple months ago very pleased item . hilt well-detailed , maybe too well detailed , proper weight make it feel like real thing . blade very bright , sounds crisp loud . only problem i saber activation switch : it located right center hilt gets way very easily . you hold saber just right avoid bulbous switch . also , it very easy accidently turn it off while you're swinging it ( very annoying ) . still , i loved it anyway you learn handle it better almost right away . i loved anakin model so much , i just get one : it toss up mace windu model or darth vader model . i chose dark side . when it arrived ups today , i immediately wanted grab some aa batteries compare two sabers . vader model just bright anakin ( it red , not pinkish ) but noticeably lighter weight . also , digital sound effects different than anakin model ( that good ) , but vader saber not loud , it also takes moment longer power up power down . it should also noted blue anakin model 4 different clashing sounds ..... red vader model only one . again , activation switch right middle hilt which makes it awkward handle first , but you learn cope it . i guess it makes them more " authentic " . however , actual lightsaber props used dramatic fight sequences not activation switches middle hilts ( it would difficult coreograph fight scene those switches way , so they removed give actors nice , smooth surfaces ..... you wouldn't able see switches since their hands covering up most hilts anyway ) . all all , i am very pleased vader model well . i recommend filming yourself pitch-black area then watch it your tv . it looks cool ! they worth price ? my opinion ..... yes , but careful them . they not toys . one more thing : few people reviewing these items say sabers louder when they chash eachother ..... not true . you're simply hearing two clashing sounds once which makes it seem louder . sabers don't any sensors know specifically when saber smacks it anyway . strike strike . next step ..... mace windu saber !	1

whole ty series very appealing variety reasons . example , animals well-designed invariably cute . they also just right size small children they make good little presents adults who like stuffed animals , but don't want lot big bulky ones lying around . other words , they make nice romantic gifts christmas , valentine day , etc . big plus this line plush toys incredible softness . they very cuddly they also seem stand up well . if you giving one these small child , it won't fall apart overnight nap material should stay good shape while . i received number these gift over years although i don't keep all them lying around , they bring back pleasant memories . i also given several gifts i never come across anyone who disappointed . while these stuffed animals expensive size what they . i feel they good value money . while you get less expensive products , i think you find they don't measure up ty line	1
my kids got this present , we assembled it , stuck batteries , poured some midnight moo chocolate syrup , sat back watch fountain . screw turned , but nothing happened . then i looked it little more closely . fountain mechanism archimedian screw , it seemed me like screw turning backwards . after some experimentation , i now figured out what went wrong . there big orange flower-pot shaped thing containing motor sitting top yellow base containing batteries . orange piece completely symmetric , it fit yellow base equally well either forwards or backwards ( there almost invisible arrow that supposed tell you which way it goes ) . if you put it backwards , positive negative terminals batteries connected wrong wires motor , screw turns wrong way , fountain doesn't work . instructions don't help much . trouble shooting tips say " make sure it assembled correctly . " they don't say " make sure arrows yellow orange pieces aligned , because it doesn't work if they're not . " i haven't tried it thick chocolate , but judging other comments , it seems like motor too weak it work chocolate thick enough worth dipping . it clearly pretty cheaply made . but it should work . if it doesn't , put orange piece other way around .	-1

after reading several reviews big wheel , i almost left this purchase dust . who wants stuck box rocks some reviews suggested ? however , i am pleased say this excellent purchase our 4 year old little boy . night our big wheel arrived , i insisted we assemble it ... just case our box missing/broken parts or pieces didn't fit together right ... even though we weren't giving this our son several more days . lucky us , we found instructions easy follow , all parts accounted , everything went together quickly easily . we spent probably 30 minutes all ... including applying stickers . not bad considering all experiences i read . best news our son actually able ride while ! even though he tall ( 43 " ) his age , he still needed seat sit closest handle bars so his feet could reach pedals . he able adjust it two more times !! now we see how much wear tear big wheel take ! already it made quite few trips down very rough rocky sidewalk . i'm certain this big wheel going get good work out often ! i am quite pleased this purchase , glad i not deterred completely experiences others .	1

we bought this our youngest daughter , then age 18 months . now age 4 , she still likes play slide . we're glad we went larger 2-step slide instead one smaller one-steps slides . smaller slide would ended up yard sale now . this our first experience chicco product , overall , i'd say we've pleased . except locking mechanism , construction high quality very durable . locking mechanism ( which supposed keep slide folding up itself ) fell apart within just few weeks pounded my rambunctious little girl . this hasn't problem , however , because wide stance slide prevents it folding up itself anyway . when it comes " cute factor , " this slide wins hands-down over all others . however , that adult perspective . our daughter couldn't care less what it shaped like or what color it . she would play it regardless these factors . one other reviewer cautioned letting children play slide unsupervised . i'd say that true , but would apply * any * slide not just this one . our daughter found all sorts creative uses this toy not envisioned manufacturer . she loves jump off top it use it ladder get top her chest drawers . it not toy faint heart -- i'm talking parents	1

grandma bought this my 2 year old daughter hope it would relieve me washing crayon off walls everything else . concept great , however my daughter tries use color wonder markers everything else then she can't get cap back so i find them laying around un-capped . also , i don't think she likes fact markers only work inside lines there slight delay time you color when color appears . we've also tried finger paints my daughter ended up dipping color wonder markers into finger paints - which didn't work so well . i think plain color wonder paper might better than coloring book style pages . i also think it geared toward older child . i think we sticking regular coloring books washable crayons while longer	1

my son loves these toys ! i purchased them target clearance one dollar 90 some odd cents . what deal ! i went several target stores area found different pieces no more than three dollars . my son 2 � great dexterity start but these taught him even more skills using screw drivers , wrenches other little tools included set . my concern he could possibly fall metal tools hurt himself but now he careful them . i am also not overly pleased play sets but trucks themselves lots fun . play sets seem little cheap but die cast trucks worth money , so me makes up lack imagination designers part . he sit play them hours end , mixing matching different parts different trucks . this purchase well worth money , i just wish i would noticed them before now . this would make great gift toddlers .	1

i really like this game too . other reviews tell how game works so i'll focus why i liked it . my 12 year old daughter received it christmas gift . we played game hour my daughter wanted keep playing asked when we could play it again so i know she liked it . i found comments each us made some wishes helped us get know each other better - we get so wrapped up everyday life it difficult really communicate . there 4 categories wish cards ( experiences , treats treasures , accomplishments family fun ) . some wishes very " girly girl " ironically her dad seemed end up lot those wishes . so , after we played it first time daughter separated those wishes out so rest wishes would more appropriate her dad . my daughter plans use girly girl wish cards when she plays it her girlfriends .	1
i bought this my daughters birthday when we got it , it piece junk buttons worked one day then next day when you tried push cerain button it would give you different noise or it would not work all , things hard push you really push hard them , this toy not worth it not even amount they asking honest i think it worth fifty cents , i am very disapointed it .	-1

now that what i'm talking ! this x-wing , second ( so far ) three lego produced minifigure scale , far superior one . it represents moment mid-episode when luke swamp planet learning jedi master all jedi , yoda . you get yoda figure , which somewhat rare , exclusive dagobah luke , r2 . sweet ! luke figure pretty neat , you choose top him off his flight helmet or hair . there lightsaber included , which i only assume yoda , because it green . ( luke saber blue this point saga . ) some reason you don't get blue luke saber , i no idea why , but green one near little storage compartment underneath yoda bed ! bed contained within neato yoda hut , which not included latest x-wing set , thus making this one far superior . you even get backback luke carry yoda around while he training , just like film . yoda hut composed quite few tan , brown , green pieces . it completely hinged , so you open it up , roof all , get inside . building it bit chore , it kept falling apart until it made more stable later steps . however , i think patient child able handle it . inside house , there bed , stove , some other trinkets . totally cool . it really increases parts count this se t.t he x-wing fighter itself one finest lego made . i guess that why it completely unchanged recent reissue . if it ain't broke ... mechanism used raise lower wings controlled dial back ship . it effective doesn't slip around . wings nicely hold " open " or " closed " position quite easily , two newer white elastic bands keep tension it . rest ship nicely detailed , lots red markings , some headlights , guns , even few green vines simulate moment when luke crashes it swamp ! how cool ? there storage compartment luke helmet underneath , control stick cockpit , slot r2 . i found this one fun build . lot design repeated later arc-170 starfighter model , so if you haven't built one those yet , this one total treat . lock s-foils attack position , fun	1

barn really cute tall older kids . however , it not " pop " up , there three rods you put out when putting it up down . also , once put together , it stood crooked , so it would not stay up . if you got it just right , it would remain standing , until one kids went into it . i am talking 19 month old , not 12 year old crashing it . needless say , we sent it back look something better . oh , send it back via amazon . company called me back after full week , wanted $15 included returned tent ( shipping you ) . things make you say hmmmmmm	-1

this game seems silly childish first glance but actually much more fun challenging than you would think ... players any age . setup very simple . each person gets animal figure hides it little plastic barn front them . your animal only revealed beginning game hidden rest time . then deck animal cards dealt out completely all players . gameplay very similar multiplayer version slap jack . you flip cards down table one time , when picture your card matches person , you blurt out sound person hidden animal . this where misconception simplicity game starts . it not easy it seems . multiple players , you must remember everyone animal . not only , but you keep your eyes all other animal cards flipped down ... so example , you cow your barn , you match pair frogs person who snake their barn . then your mind begins scramble sorting through all different information very quickly . faster game goes more fun it . whomever loses " blurting " match , then picks up all their cards , well all dropped cards winner . first drop all their cards wins . game actually gets more more complicated each passing game . seeing person who mouse last game may sheep next pig one after . overall game becomes fun time people laughing blurting out random noises ... often times just nonsensical jibberish you scramble make right noise firs t.t his game very versatile . friend mine teacher got set her class rainy days . but we also realized this could great game small children teach animal sounds ... well older children exercise foreign language class	1

hannibal lecter figure we told we would never get . late 1990 mcfarlane toys go-to company paved way figures like this , producing toys like freddy jason when no one else . it under mature action figure series called movie maniacs eager horror fans received 7-inch versions their favorite boogeymen . however , years passed mcfarlane sadly dropped ball somewhere , no longer producing new highly demanded figures , simply rehashed ones we'd seen countless times before . although today mcfarlane still make impressive quality figures , neca company keep eye if your interests lie horror , science fiction , cult films ( mine ) . i not claim know how they it , but somehow neca convinced anthony hopkins sign over his likeness rights this figure , i thank toy god they . first time ever , hannibal lecter presented here , he extremely memorable segment academy award winning film , silence lambs . he sporting classic straight jacket , blazing prison orange pants , face restraint/mask , dolly cart . only cut ankles ball-jointed neck , his articulation rather limited , you might imagine . however attention detail astonishing . mask removable , show off eerie anthony hopkins likeness i rather impressed , despite negativity others . take it me , eyes this figure resemble eyes dr. lecter so well , it frightening . figure made stay attached his cart , which ability pivot back forth , but he removed stand well his own . his jacket nice wash dark grey over it , highlighting all creases wrinkles , establishing nice gritty feel . all together , his clothing hangs off his body frame well , gives off realistic appearance . sculpting paint application very impressive , accurate film . however i few minor complaints . straps his mask very small , soft , difficult secure when putting mask place . it gets very aggravating , especially if you big fingers small patience . also , keeping likeness amazing anthony hopkins , figure features some balding back his head . however , rather than sculpting nice comb-over look clearly separating hair bald skin , there simply flesh color painted square patch directly over full head hair . this doesn't look right , sticks out when looking figure any angle other than straight forward . fortunately it fixed rather easily , any kind black paint or pen . few strands hair highlighted black resemble more natural look . i hand it neca , they began wannabe company , producing figures here there , barely rivaled likes mcfarlane older work . today they first-class , producing wide assortment figures collectibles constantly putting their predecessors shame . neca knows what fans want , hannibal top never-ending wish list . truly amazing figure , only few minor problems . it makes me proud add grand dr. hannibal lecter my collection .	1

puerto rico best all around board game i ever played . balance i would say near perfection all games i've played score always very close . while this game out box takes little while understand nuances rules how take advantage different roles , it very worthwhile rewarding . after two plays , my friends all very into it anxious play again . fifty foot view game looks something like this . everyone board area placing plantations city area buildings . plantations grow crops , you need certain buildings produce/store crops which go city area you eventually want ship those crops(back mainland ... whateva ) that how you ultimately score points . there variety different crops you grow different types buildings which give different type advantages(and worth certain # victory points ) . each person takes turn their turn chooses certain role which how game functions . each role offers different functions/phases game , ie building where everyone gets build building , or captain where you get ship your goods .... player choosing phase typically gets additional bonus which where lot strategy revolves around . some things i like puerto rico , you really don't know who going win until game ends points counted up . this keeps everyone interested playing intently throughout . you also alert each turn take advantage other players moves order successful . also , other reviewers stated , luck simply just not factor so it hard people sore losers or point game flaws caused them lose(or someone else win ) , instead it typically friendly chat how picking strategy seemed make most sense . only real downside this game , there really isn't need much interaction other players , or any direct conflict . those coming settlers catan background , robber phase trading really what makes ... these features lacking puerto rico . some say captain phase like ' conflict ' , but i disagree . this small quibble , allows you play friends non-friends o-o ne getting upset . many say this game too deep non-gamers you may want start off simpler games get up speed . i would actually disagree . i've bought lot games past few months , i think we could played puerto rico right off bat . if you market new board game , go this game ! take quick read through rules , set it up take few rounds get questions out way ... than start over you'll all set enjoy great game .	1

when i first saw this product , i thought it sounded really great . only thing i thought might better would if music would turn off when too much pressure applied . i bought one my daughter try discovered real problem . since music stops whenever there not enough pressure brush , user more hesitant move brush around get all teeth . when my daughter uses this brush , she misses large areas retains much plaque . main cons : -pressure must applied , too much pressure not turn music off . results : many areas don't get clean . too much pressure results gum inflamation , tooth erosion , ultimately lead bone loss periodontal problems . -brush action not most effective removing plaque . summary : manual brush proper technique out perform this brush plaque removal . power brush rotary motion small brush head most effective method plaque removal . test brushing technique periodically using some form disclosing ( plaque staining ) such gum redcote tablets or agent cool blue mouth rinse . place toothbrushes play tunes , your child listen his/her favorite song while brushing brush until song ends . don't forget floss !!	-1

" elevation track pack ( ramps ) " one three track kits offered elevation series . other two kits " elevation track pack ( flats ) , " elevation track pack ( straights ramps ) " . ramps kit great because it includes 4 ramps , which enough track elevate train level 0 ( ground level ) level 1 , level 2 , then all way back down level 1 then level 0 . you need this kit use sky high suspension bridge ( level 1 ) , high chimes clock tower ( levels 1 2 ) . other useful kit you should purchase this one elevation track pack ( flats ) . once train elevated , you want stay level . flats kit includes few straights , just importantly , extra stanchions needed hold track up . straights ramps kit not very useful because it includes only 6 stanchions ( supports hold up track ) . there not enough stanchions use elevation track way it intended . only disadvantage layouts get quite complex because now layout three dimensional ( instead two ) . this may present challenge use up all track pieces build fun interesting layout . you'll run out track go through number iterations , time , get it all connected . all things considered , it great toy very rugged it keep your child interest long time . some great track layout ideas , search " geotrax track layout " ebay	1

my seven year old niece tea party theme her birthday , so this perfect gift ! she worked it my ten year old daughter , they completed it one full day . finished product great . this not cheaply made tea set that going break first time you play it . my only complaint every color paint too thick so we add water . i should taken advise reviewer only added few drops . i made yellow bit too runny	1
i may not youngest " kid " anymore , but type loves create arts crafts , i figured purchasing this little more than $20 bucks decent price something could make cutting easier those tiny , hard-to-reach places x-acto knives can't reach easily . product relatively solid built very well . i expecting less . though perforating cutting tip which often errs may not most precision tool around , price it expected . but use it ruler you'll get very straight cuts . it also great ' score ' paper where you'd like fold instead cut . unlike previous reviewer , i can't agree cuts ever come out x-acto blade-smooth ; paper fray no matter how slow you cut . however , if you want x-acto-quality cuts you should buy xacto blade . ;) i'm not too sure just how kid-safe this item . oftentimes blade ( which essentially tiny ice pick ) stop exposed position , though it hardly exposed enough cause any serious harm anything but eye . i've touched blade lightly my finger while it activated see if there potential dangerous children , but it would probably take firm press break skin ( course , i didn't want test any further ) . it stated box kids should supervised while using this machine , so don't leave it them while you other things . no matter how safe it may seem , kids always get into kinds trouble you never expect while you're not looking . required two batteries don't seem like they'll last very long , unit specificially says its battery cover " not use rechargable batteries , " so option out . fact there not option ac adapter also counts against it . overall this product great kids ' tool variety projects where you need cutting " where scissors can't . " go scissors where you , then use this those smaller areas . 4 out 5 stars , only due limited power options	1
i bought this my 6 year old daughter birthday june , its entertaining she loves it . cartridges little hard find little pricey . also headphones stopped working it only little over month old . overall she likes i guess i just need get her some new headphones ( which it seems fisher price not sell ) .	1
i only came across this set while pricing water tower different websites , knew it one . i buy track water tower seperately , which would huge waste money . i compared water towers , i believe $25 one 1 piece color red ... other than it identical one set when it comes size weight . i set it up other day " inspect " it , make sure it really what i wanted give ds . track set up very easy only takes minute or two . tracks double sided , which would make it easier him . two tracks road print them , don't look like other side all , but i don't mind . train also moved slowly across track . track pieces fit little snug , which positive negative . it good because i know it won't easy piece slide out place , if it gets hit few times , it harder my son take apart . negative i put it together take it apart because it hard him those ( it isn't big deal all ) . it come thomas engine ... when i reading up this set , i couldn't find anywhere if it came engine . i thought it just came boxcar ( very pleased again ) . box car comes it plastic , not wood like rest , it isn't big deal me , but it may others . i think price set very reasonable . water tower alone $25 thomas engine alone $10 . set comes both $40 . i like think track set only cost $5 , when price broken down individual items . overall i am very satisfied this train set . i can't wait ds open it his birthday . i also can't wait add it christmas . it perfect first train set	1

here example toy great idea but poor product . my son received this car his first birthday . he likes it 16 months learned push button make it go . but after 4 months light use it stopped rolling . new batterys don't help . it sounds like it working but won't roll . dad taking it apart try fix it but we shouldn't resort just 4 months . aside , major downside there no automatic shutdown . if your toddler loses interest toy after few minutes ( they all ) , car continues make noise until someone gets up shut it down ( draining battery ) . seems like small thing but it gets annoying . price , it may acceptable some . aside its problems it perfect toddlers . there just one button push make it go ; push it once it goes forward ; push it again it turns left ; push it again it goes forward again . so it not something you truly " steer " or anything but it give toddler sense control . if they could add auto shutdown feature improve reliability it could great little toy	-1

i pleasantly surprised bratz kidz dolls . they look lot less ' hard ' than regular bratz , much cuter more age appropriate clothes . although i admit it little tricky squeeze clothes over their strangely large forearms calves , it isn't too hard .

i really like slinky dog . bought it my 2 1/2 year old christmas . she enjoys movie toy story " slinky " one her favorite charecters . it replica 1950 ( i beleive ) only disappointing fact concern child safety present day , manufactured moved pull string its original location also made string shorter ( prevent estrangalation ) . this said , it very difficult meneuver toy . cute toy , but just not functional	1

we bought this card game years ago way interact our children . it relatively simple game few complicated rules challenge younger children . although game competative , everyone scores even if game doesn't go quite your way , you get reward effort anyway . popularity nascar , this game sure hit any auto racing fan . it fast paced so , even if you stopped one many hazards , play continues added excitement . mille bornes teaches how strategies work . there many ways manipulate play plan how you , or your team , finish race first place ! there even ways play allow loser sometimes gain more points than actual winner . see yourself . special car-shaped tin storage container , even when you're not playing game , you play mille bornes	1

expect game last bit longer , obviously , also couple rule changes . because players collect resources greater rate turns , expansion pack rules allow player buy betweens turns , instead just during turn . this makes things bit more confusing , but once adjustment made , game runs fine . if you like game , want add person or two , expansion must	1
i admit this quite possibly best game i've ever played . you time-traveller trying change recorded history fit your history . there 3 ways win : changing timeline suit your history , gathering 3 artifacts your wish list , or amassing 10 cards your hand . also , you break up deck play simple artifact game , which lot quicker takes up less table room . or if yourself , you play solonauts , solitaire version chrononauts . try get 8 time travellers home before deck runs out . it not easy it first sounds .	1
this product cheap all around . after finally getting table together when we tried get chairs put together , predrilled holes help you made wood split . it not safe child . looks very cute , but very poor quality . even wood scraps . you see where they put two pieces together make them long enough legs table . we returned this item still hunt set we like safe kids .	-1
i love this starfighter . i would say this my favorite three new ones ( they're all same model- just matter what your favorite color combination ) . anyone considering purchasing this- photos very accurate depictions toy . it two firing missiles not revealed until you press button wings open up , which great feature . all who cannot find figure place pilot- i found obi-wan figure target exclusive drinking cup only figure who fit comfortably cockpit . he may not pilot head gear- but , he ep . iii figure ep . iii look . i tried ep . ii obi-wan cockpit it just didn't look right this ep . iii vehicle . go target get cup figure- unless you want wait until obi wan pilot comes out later this year .	1
we received this engine starter set year ago . it worked fine while . later it would only work reverse , then few days ago quit working all together . i think my 2-year-old daughter stood it , messed up internal gears . knowing it probably my daughters fault i didn't think warranty would cover it . i went toy store year old broken toy , no receipt , no box . needless say i fully expected buy new engine . my amazement toy store didn't ask any questions or me fill out any paperwork . they just handed me new engine , it . brio may expensive , but i think no questions asked return policy worth money you spend brio trains	1

i'd give this chair 0 stars if option . chair seemed great first helping my son sit upright practice his sitting skills . he started using chair around 4 months old . i very careful using this chair . i only put him it when it floor i always nearby supervise . one day my son reaching toy next chair he fell completely out chair flat onto his face . luckily he wasn't hurt there no furniture nearby him bump into , but this could've very serious scary hazard . chair seems like great idea , but i really want all parents know it not safe . i written company complain am awaiting full refund . don't use this chair your baby	-1
i ordered these my son first birthday but unfortunately they didn't arrive time . even though this item says eligible prime shipping , beware . it only eligible prime standard shipping . not two-day shipping . anyway , once they arrived they great . we immediately starting building he loves knocking down what we create . i know some people said there should more pieces build , but we found it enough . we sat floor creating many different varieties buildings my son so much fun knocking them ground . pieces also perfect our one year old . they're big so i don't worry him chocking since they're hollow light weight i don't worry him getting hurt when he knocks towers . there no sharp corners either . far them not snapping toghether , i like this feature . my son age if they snapped together he couldn't get them apart easily they would frustrate him he wouldn't want play them . i think they're designed very well . i would highly recommend these blocks children who too young mega blocks legos . this great set your child first blocks	1
my 4-year-old son just every thomas brio engine market , including " electric " versions thomas his friends . this one different -- it not move itself electric vehicles . rather , it makes train track noises your child pushes it track . it fun addition younger child set ( one who not ready electric engine moves itself ) -- well great addition older child set it new different . plus , it feels sturdy . i've only it week , but it looks like it last while -- self-propelled electric engines , while they're well-built , no match long-term hijinks little boy	1
i gave two blasters my 10 year old twin grandkids ( 1 boy , 1 girl ) christmas . i included two packages marshmallows them . first , blasters wouldn't work because , believe it or not , jet-puffed marshmallows too big . after someone found bag regular-sized marshmallows , fun began . it took while my grand-daughter get her blaster out hands one " adults , " but she finally retrieved it . i given them much more expensive gifts over years , but nothing ever so much fun these . i gave these toys 4 stars instead 5 because it too hard pump blaster enough get major blast until they oiled pump olive oil . i suggest this recommendation included toys . ps their dog probably overload sugar , chasing eating flying marshmallows	1
i got this alphabet block set my 16-month old daughter ( even though suggested age 2+) . she enjoys nesting toys general , so i knew she'd like these . she also likes stacking blocks up , then knocking them over . when all stacked together , blocks stand taller than her ( she 31 inches ) . i'm sure when she gets older , she'll able use this toy help her learning alphabet . right now , it all stacking nesting . these blocks very colorful i'm sure she'll use them long time ! melissa doug great job this one ! these different than other blocks - only storage space needed largest block - all them fit inside	1

my daughter loves her lite-brite . she used all 8 picture sheets first 2 days she played it . i looked looked refil pages without much success . i not able find them stores . one website i found offers them ( hasbro ) perpetually sold out . 4 , my daughter better following pattern than creating her own . two months after she recieved it , we completely out black construction paper which i cutting fit toy . other than , this game great ! she really loves it plays it every day . i wish hasbro would come out ' coloring book ' filled detachable design pages market them side toy	1

vengeance great action figure marvel legends legendary riders series . one best . it new body sculpt near i tell . articulation very good all joints tight well concealed . his picture package differs little than actual product inside . picture , you see his skull bony tusks growing out his chest bone-colored . but actual product , they purple . i don't know why they , but i prefer bone color instead purple . other than , paint job very good . there lots great details all over this figure . such spikes his shoulder , head , hands bone chains adorn his forearms , belt , jacket . leather jacket looks nice , too . even his character-dedicated vehicle looks great . ribcage flaming wheels really help make it look demonic he . figure doesn't fit well vehicle , but could unique figure i purchased . there two pegs near seat figure placed upon . there matching holes back figure thighs where pegs fit . it takes little manipulating pushing , but you get him there put him some nice poses . i love idea character-dedicated vehicles . it would nicer if they light sound feature or fired missile or something , but this good start . he also comes ghost rider #39 comic book -- which ok showing who what vengeance . but one thing i noticed vengeance purple head tusks comic book , so maybe picture package wrong . ( bone color still looks nice , though ) vengeance seems fairly easy purchase , so getting one or replacing broken one should simple . but , if you deciding whether get one or not , i highly recommend you . this figure very good -- any marvel legends fan would pleased	1
