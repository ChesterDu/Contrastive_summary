look what i found ? where ? under there ! under wear ? ... right there ! it says , " first person write review " jockey boxer briefs . hmmmm ... no wonder no one reviewed these yet -- who writes review men underwear ? ok , fine , i'll it . i love these , my preferred brand style . your brand your style may vary this category apparel tends personal preference item . i only buy these black i am firm believer underwear ( men especially ) should not white -- time end day rolls around it time change them -- it better left wondering what might there opposed seeing it so prominently displayed white background ! these hold up well price . nothing lasts forever . elastic band usually first go ( after many repeated washings ) before material gives out . i.e. they fall off before they rot off . finally , so i feel like i complete job reviewing these , i buddy mine help ultimate test - weggie test - these shorts handled it well ... extreme pain reached well before structure and/or material boxer short failed . i give these " ten tippy toes " rating how well they performed test .	1

this truly beautiful bag ! i got classic dark leather , which exactly rich brown shown pictures . leather wonderful grain adds bag character . leather thicker than i expected ; while it no means stiff , it not ultra-soft , ultra-thin butter leather . this leather age well last many , many years . zippers matte silver metal so not only they look great against brown leather , they'll durable . ( other hardware same type matte/antiqued silver . ) bag lined heavy khaki twill just shade or two lighter than strap . cotton strap not only adds bag uniqueness , it also keeps bag sliding when you bend over . ( i wear it across my chest like messenger bag . ) inside there two small pockets divider separating two sections bag . one gusseted works well cell phone ( or items similar size ) other suitable only small flat items such business cards ; i would really liked my ipod snuggle second pocket but something thick won't fit . internal sections bag large enough hold notebook , file or book but bag smaller than most other messenger bags i've tried because they sized laptops . i actually use it purse it plenty room all my junk ubiquitous book . outside , each end bag pocket vertical row stitching bisecting it . this creates 2 tall , thin pockets where i keep pens ; it would nice if one side didn't row stitching so it could hold larger items , but that not problem me . entire back side bag zippered pocket . front flap small zippered pocket turns out good home cell phone because you get it quickly without going into bag . magnetic closure flap sufficiently strong . there 2 magnets body bag flap there metal bar running width flap so you don't worry lining up magnets close bag . i've bag only few days already received compliments . though bag pricey , it obviously crafted care high-quality materials . it also very distinctive look . i am very happy this purchase already added diongini bag my amazon wish list	1

these good quality baby bodysuits , very reasonably priced . make sure you buy size according your baby weight height not age posted . my 3 month old girl wearing 6-9 month size . they little big , but thats great because they last longer . warning : medium green body suit not color fast , end up looking like " camo " wear after you wash it . other body suits green pack color fast not fade quickly . it seems it just one green bodysuit doesn't hold up well . i not any fading pink bodysuits . all all i'd recommend these	1

i am huge fan under armour workout apparel , addition owning several these tech t-shirts , also own several each loose gear shirts ( 0084 ) heat gear compression shirts ( 0039 ) - i've written reviews those well . tech t-shirt ( 0382 ) feels really good your skin - like your favorite , most comfortable old cotton t-shirt . it looks just like cotton matte finish - it not shiny/silky like loose gear shirts or heat gear compression shirts . it very soft , comfortable lightweight , i love this shirt both working out casual wear . shirt runs true size ( buy your regular t-shirt size it fit really well ) , roomiest cut under armour shirts . i absolutely love raglan sleeves tech tee - one features makes them so comfortable gives them little bit unique look . tech tee small amount lycra-like fabric polyester microfiber , which gives it quite bit stretch . i like this because shirt doesn't bind if you're doing something really requires you reach or stretch - certain weight exercises , aerobics , yoga , etc . shirt works way it supposed , wicks moisture your skin rapid evaporation . tech tee available numerous colors ( i 6 them ) spite fact fabric thin lightweight , shirts very opaque . shirts nice cut look great over jeans or shorts - addition gym , i often wear them out around , or when working yard . they super comfortable worn undershirt too , but probably little costly . like all under armour shirts , they self-material neck band , but it fits just right says place , even if you get sweaty - it doesn't sag like cotton ones . while i zero complaints tech tee , aware it under armour " budget " product , if there such thing . material start pill after few washings - this affects appearance slightly , but not performance or fit . although i haven't worn out any my under armour shirts yet , i'm going venture tech t-shirt won't quite durable their signature loose gear shirts heat gear compression shirts , nor it perform quite well . other hand it , it 20% cheaper , so anything else , you get what you pay . when stacked up against ua other shirts , i'd say tech tee you if : 1 ) you like look feel soft , cotton t-shirt but want wicking performance microfiber shirt . 2 ) you don't care shiny , silky , more synthetic look feel loose gear shirts , or tightness heatgear compression shirt . 3 ) you want shirt that little roomier . 4 ) you want shirt stretch it . 5 ) you want save little $$ but still wear authentic ua logo shirt	1

( 5'6 " , 102 lbs ) . wee bit snug around ankles ( prolly cuz my ankles wee bit bigger than average since i'm wee bit big boned ) but worth it cuz how sexy it looks :-d very comfy 4 " high heel !	1
easy slip secure my arm very comfortable during workouts or run	1

i really not believe this item would work . i lit " three match ordered three prove it . i still can't believe just how well it worked just perfectly promised . where this product all my life ! i just happened " stumble " over it looking ties . thanks foryour great product placement . i promise anyone reading this one thing : you not find better value your money anywhere internet	1
yoga mats come three basic thicknesses . 1/8 " this mat average thickness . mats half thick this one good travel or placing under thicker mat provide more traction . thick mats ( 3/16 " ) 50% thicker than this one designed those who need or want extra cushion . 24 " 68 " it average length width . these mats really beautiful ! professional , i'm normally not concerned look mat ; it performance ease use primary concern . however , these mats stunning ! you'll definitely get oohs aahs your fellow yoga enthusiasts when you roll these out . blue one looks like ocean orange looks like liquid lava ! i especially love how design goes all way through mat isn't just ' printed ' one side . design your mat last long your mat . there two sides this nearly all yoga mats . look carefully ' bumps ' each side mat . larger bumps designed face upwards cushion your hands , feet , knees during poses while keeping your body dangerously slipping out alignment . smaller bumps designed face downwards grip floor keep yoga mat sliding . many mats label one end name brand . this typically , but not always , located ' up ' side . bumps tell you sure . this yoga mat increase softness stickiness use . ( so most mats . ) they start out mildly sticky increase stickiness more they used . you want wash your mat when it first arrives so remove thin film they get their surface during manufacturing process . instructions washing mat included . once you've washed dried your mat you're ready begin ! after using it while , if you find mat decreasing stickiness each time you pull it out , this typical sign light coating dust or too much body sweat accumulated your mat it needs light hand washing very diluted soap water . after washing , roll your mat thick towel squeeze out excess water , otherwise it take forever dry air . then , air dry your mat unrolled , inside , away sunlight . ( hanging over shower bar works nicely . ) when you first unroll your mat you find one end bit curled . simply alternate direction you roll your mat ( top outside once , then bottom outside next ) or end you start ( curled end once , flat end next time ) you'll find it straightening out more or less over time . i recommend buying your own yoga mat even if your yoga studio or gym provides them you . i've worked many studios gyms over years . sometimes management mats cleaned often , sometimes not . if you bring your own mat you always know where it . :o ) plus , owning your own mat may encourage you begin valuable practice home . my students who trouble their knees some poses requiring body weight rest knee , i recommend temporarily folding over one end mat get double cushion under knee while still leaving one layer under rest body . this saves you haul more than one mat out each time you practice which discouraging especially beginner .	1

i purchased boston clog summer 2000 , worn it every year since then , am happy report it still most comfortable shoe i possess . since many other reviews here praised its comfort , i briefly pass over few problems probably occur over long-term wear . first , after year wear , outsole began detach itself rest clog . this easily fixed some shoe glue i purchased shoe store . since applying it 2001 or so , i not any further problems outsole coming off . second , mentioned one review , part outsole where your foot hits ground most often wear out fastest . this expected . nevertheless , after close seven year worth wear , outsole still holding up quite well , heel only place where there no grip pattern left . still , plenty outsole remains . finally , year ago leather lining footbed started detach itself cork underneath heel . again , any good adhesive solve problem . this time i used super glue -- problem solved . overall , leather reflects seven year worth use , but it still holding up very well , both footbed , entire upper part . all things considered , i worn lot shoes past seven years , many them overpriced european brands fabled comfort ( ecco , camper , clarks ) but boston clog outlasted all them terms durability comfort . i highly recommend this quality shoe	1

amazon notes these socks " only made finest yarns . " they mean it , too ! these socks keep your feet warm ; they very well made last forever . these athletic crew socks worn athletic activities but course they could worn everyday routine use well . addition , they made 85% gold toe " ultrabrite " acrylic 15% stretch nylon . amazon states acrylic gives these socks " wickability " but this word may typographical error ; i could not find entry word " wickability " dictionary . price right , too . these crew length socks also fit any shoe size 7 12 ; therefore it -- almost -- one size fits all . reinforced heel toe makes them last longer they still feel very comfortable my feet . sock itself comes white ; but toe area literally made gold colored fibers . i would not dry these socks high temperatures . this could result sock becoming too loose your foot . eventually they could " bunch up " when you wear them that very uncomfortable . dry these fine socks lower temperature . then they remain just comfortable ever . i know mine ! overall , you can't go wrong buying these socks . they keep your feet extra warm during colder weather . they manufactured so well you definitely get more than your money worth . good deal ! smile	1

these light ( weight ) hikers slip-on shoe appears lace-up ( thus , " chameleon " ) . i put these things test extended hiking chores come day end sore back , legs , etc - but feet feeling fine ready more . sounds like baloney but it not . i cannot overstate how pleased i mine . great traction they show essentially no wear thus far . it scares me think what it take wear these things out . i didn't buy them looks , but i've several compliments them . some additional observations -- there essentially no break period . you hit it hard them right out box they'll treat your feet well . although slip-on , due their substantial construction , they not pull all easily . you use handy heel tab provided give pretty good tug . they look kind like running shoe ( " chameleon effect " again ) i gave them go two mile jog . big mistake . i might well wearing steel-toe engineer boots . these things substantial heel element concealed shoe they felt like they weighed ton . they not cross-trainers not suited running shoe . i fully recommend these situations where one their feet all day casual/sports appearing shoe appropriate . worth price	1

i've trying find decent bra ages : one would attractive * * hold things place same time . i afraid i'd doomed old 1950s bulletproof , cone-shaped bra-in-a-box styles forever ... those anything but seductive . ( i recently changed bra sizes one stores carried multiple styles/selections 34ddd , which you order online or made- astronomical prices . ) i hopeful this bra , because it decently priced ~ ~ i wasn't disappointed . underwire 4 hooks give excellent hold , cups deep enough cover everything ( keep things pointing up where they belong ) , criss-cross lacing cups gives it just enough peek-a-boo allure make it sexy . even though this bra sedate white , it still passed husband whistle-test . :) not bad !	1

breastfeeding mother , it important me i keep my bras dry leak-free ( not mention my clothes ) . i've using my lily padz since my daughter ( now nearly 4 weeks old ) few days old . ( we latch-on problems initially , so i used washable pads until my nipples healed . ) i really like this product . it smooth under clothing , it clings pretty reliably . it isn't perfect , but it doesn't claim . when i gushing let-down , nothing contain it , not lily padz nor cloth breast pads . that little disappointing , but i suppose it expected . i only wish tackiness held up little better . i tended lovingly my lily padz , following instructions washing drying what not . fact , i only wear them during day . night , i wash them before i go bed , leave them domes dry over night ( using washables night ) . despite following instructions lily padz maintenance very carefully , i feel they've lost their tackiness , i worry their effectiveness . so far , no big problems , but i'd feel more secure if they not appear started wear out already . still - they're totally worth investment , i may just buy pair , so i alternate keep wear minimum	1

i've using gt-2000 series shoes 2+ years now , i honestly say , they're most comfortable running shoes my build . this one asics best , if not best , selling shoes because it offers such wide variety fit most foot types . these shoes mainly designed moderate heavy over-pronator ( when feet roll too much ) low medium arches , but i've met fellow runners same shoe who medium high arches . i , myself , am flat-footed , but use orthotics . this major problem me when buying shoes because i need something wide enough heel allow my orthotics fit , these work great . don't worry if you don't wide heel because there memory foam embedded heel forms your foot over time . heel forefoot also offer good amount stability support . shoe designed medium large builds , but again , i've come across other runners who much lighter use same shoe . when i first began running , i weighed 300+ pounds , now 216 pounds , shoes still work well ( i've bought newer version this shoe i've worn others out ) . " upper " ( top parts shoe ) really comfortable . it made mesh material allows maximum amount air circulation into foot , while allowing all heat , moisture sweat out . shoe so comfortable , you could easily run it without socks ( which i only few times ) . 2000 series versatile , they're well priced , they come variety sizes , widths , colors , so chances they'll fit you . this far best running shoe i've used up date , would recommend it anyone who just starting or long time runner .	1
