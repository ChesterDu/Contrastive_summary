first , let me say i really wanted like this device . i patience understanding while but it got me nowhere . main issue this phone its operating system : windows mobile 5.0 . this os piece fluff garbage . simple things should take click or two become so difficult access you basically just give up . main gripes ----------- connectivity t-mobile horrible : accessing aim function doesn't work 9 times out 10 . e-mail functions useless . i tried finding solution hours best i got my email checked every hour but deleted shortly after . internet explorer never find page i'm looking consistently tells me try again . even when connected wi-fi this happens . let me tell you also this device not let you choose wi-fi edge . if you already opened ie you using edge then it continue use edge unless you restart phone wi-fi enabled . calls ----- making call so difficult i wanted smash phone daily basis . usually , i would press talk dial call it would immediately say " call ended . " it if device doesn't even want try . also , when answering call , well trying answer call , it would drop it soon i pressed talk . what hell !? what good phone if you can't make or receive calls ? keep mind this happens around half time . also keep mind i live new york city ! my calls should not dropping except when i'm subway . side volume button extremely annoying causing volume go both extremes within one conversation . not only , but when you disable it , you no other method changing volume device . arggghhh ! keyboard ------- while keyboard basically easy type , phone buggy . first off , t9 sucks ! it completely change word you typing word that its dictionary while you're typing ! extremely frustrating ! now get this , you can't even permanently keep t9 off . so you keep going into menu change it normal abc mode . while i appreciate ability faster typing , isn't whole point qwerty able type without using t9 ? when you actually get typing , sometimes , keys " stick " character continuously repeat until you stop it . this isn't physical keyboard issue but yet software issue . programs ------- all you techno oriented people out there ( basically everyone buying this phone ) , programs this device available download minuscule . not only catalog programs extremely limited but when using java program ( which most programs coded ) dash java program not allow you open those programs . i always get error stating " java midlet not responding " it then gives me choice waiting or killing app . neither which solve anything . this phone so useless it beyond words . i could go it issues but i really don't care . stay away this phone ! while t-mobile customer support very helpful friendly , their service/coverage non-existent . calls constantly dropped , i get voice mails without phone even ringing , internet connectivity never really available . please , yourself favor wait iphone .	1
worked good few months .. then battery started draining fast . now after just 1 or 2 calls battery dead .	1

this great skin treo 700 . i used this product four months , brand prior . others noted , it increase thickness somewhat ( but certainly no less than leather cases , etc ) . but " thickness " gains you considerable protection . i dropped my phone concrete several times nary scratch . i like design this unit it leaves keyboard exposed thus it easy type . function buttons under skin , but easy press .	1

i really like my lg vx4400 phone even though there lots cooler phones out now . i've used it 3 years really like it basic functionality . battery lasted 3 years until recently that pretty good considering how often people lose their phones or low-battery life . i'm hoping it'll last 2 more years before i get new phone catch up modern world	1

there many good reviews 8525 positive features most fairly accurate . lots good features 8525 . my intent document some shortcomings 8525 windows mobile os hope ms htc heed correct future . i am business user who wanted combine my hp ipaq 1945 my motorola v550 cell phone into one device . i use motorola h700 headset my old devices 8525 . my overall assessment ; replacing my two 3 year old devices resulted me accepting some compromises i don't think necessary terms functionality ease use . all features i describe below earlier windows mobile os used my ipaq 1945 or my motorola flip phone . if readers find there way perform any deficiencies i describe please let me know . my suggestions rough order priority : 1 ) blue tooth headsets . blue tooth audio should always come through blue tooth headset regardless pda volume setting . hear my voice commands repeated , i turn annoying sound pda , so when i voice dial via my blue tooth headset , i hear my voice commands repeated back . i am referring standard voice dial comes 8525 . one quick solution would tie bt headset phone volume setting rather than pda . even nicer would upgrade allows full audio " voicecommand " software ( this documented many other reviews ) . nice feature my motorola cell phone soon bt detected phone volume changed vibrate audio if it set vibrate . it changed back original audio setting after turning off bt headset . 1a ) if i request voice dial via my blue tooth headset screen should always display voice dial page . instead initial " owner info " page stays up you can't see name screen unless you reach down tap screen . not desirable when driving . if you didn't set pda its annoying noise level you can't hear name you requested either . 2 ) need able control pda phone volume independently audio , vibrate or off . example need able tie turn up phone volume while keeping pda volume setting off or vibrate . 3 ) need able program how long display stays . i am constantly groping find power button side keep display it turns off when i need see something . 4 ) i would buy non bluetooth headset if one available long drives when my bt headset battery dead . only solution i see 8525 stereo headphones turning speaker which little noisy listeners while driving freeway . 5 ) provide built way make ptt comm manager , ie quick key buttons programmable . i would use them many other functions ; such ptt bringing up volume control so i change it vibrate audio speaker ( need able select speaker here see below ) . 6 ) give me way press external button toggle speaker off . i can't easily push speaker icon my fingers . suggestion . add radio button volume control allows you select speaker phone . yes you select phone speaker soft button , but often display gone blank keypad showing . turning speaker on/off should easier . 7 ) provide option save email attachments storage card . my ipaq windows os allowed me capture lots attachments without running out memory . 8 ) remember filter setting i selected tasks . if i filtered task category during session remember filter i selected . currently i so many tasks there 5 second delay bring them all up 9 ) give me way turn off internet browser quick key ( or make this button programmable ) i am always close browser because it gets hit/selected10 ) let me edit/paste one step notes , word , task notes etc . ipaq " edit " bottom . 8525 os you must select menu , then edit , then copy . keep edit bottom . question : there key keypad select cntrl copy like what pc ( letters underlined menu , but i don't see cntrl key keypad ? 11 ) allow trackwheel scroll up icons top then use nav button move across icons ( might way allow external way set audio volume)12 ) if i power off device it remember my input selection . example i select " letter recognizer " . but i must reset each time i power 8525 off .	1
