slim jims may taste ok but that because they so greasy . that what helps flavor . i can't figure out why anyone would like these i can't seem chew them point where i feel comfortable swallow . it like eating really really tough piece gristle meat . amount fat , cholesterol etc also higher than beef jerky . i'd rather eat beef jerky than this stuff . least i chew beef jerky	-1
i've tried this coffee all size settings . it too weak my taste even smallest brew size . if it stronger i still don't think i would care flavor . it just doesn't taste like good colombian coffees i've , not even close . this definitely one i would not purchase again	-1
i found these very dry just taste like dates . i like raw revolution bars lot better	-1
i bought both ahi tuna jerky salmon jerky . both dried out brittle . absolutely worst	-1
tea good , but i looking box keep around while felt lining hardly hides fact it cheap particle board box	-1
product fine . but description misleading . each package contains " 40 count , " , 40 filters . but this not " ( pack 12 ) , " you would think description , price reduction ( $23.88 $1.93 ) , shipping weight ( 4.20 lbs ) . it just one box 40 filters . you'll pay , i , $11 fedex bring you this one box . soon after i submitted this feedback , i issued partial refund $7 . product description still needs correcting , but least customer service responsive	-1
sadly , this pretty crummy tea . decent orange pekoe , i remain sold typhoo	-1
i bought this item thinking i getting healthy snack . fruit soaked high fructose corn syrup , it extremely sweet . not healthy .	-1
these things just plain disgusting . if you ever need emegency rope , get these , but otherwise i doubt they fit human consumption . it feels tastes like eating soft plastic , i would hate think what they your insides . i battled even give some these away , so they ended up trash , where they rightfully belong	-1
two six packages beginning mold , but not even close expiration date . one other package visibly torn . i curious see if any packs still sealed air-tight , so i placed them water . five packs exposed air small opening around seal . i imagine they burst somewhere their travels changes altitude/pressure . i cannot vouch actually taste product i not eat them . silver lining : amazon great customer service	-1
this just like cup noodles without noodles . eek	-1
bear naked granola just fabulous . i've tried every granola around , bear naked strikes right balance crunchy , sweet , ostensibly , good you . amazon price certainly beats what you'd pay store .	1
this annie chun udon soup very easy prepare . i don't think first step necessary either . just add water noodles dried vegetables , cover it lid microwave it 3 1/2 minutes . add sauce packet . noodles loosen up after you stir it . if you what more filling soup , add meat/vegetables . my kids i really love this soup ! i just purchased more amazon , because it better buy here than grocery store	1
serves well in-between meals snack . got good deal amazon	-1
title pretty much says it all . i reserve 5 stars what i consider best best . i wanted gluten-free cereal different few i've eating over years . this definitely not like usual " crispy rice . " it much more substantial ( not " 90% air " ) , nice , though not too strong , cocoa flavor , doesn't get soggy first two minutes after milk ( or other drink product ) poured it . rater talked empty calories . i'll generous assume reviewer not particularly familiar reading ( comparing ) nutrition labels . if high quality rice also considered " empty calories , " review would valid . but comparing koala crisp nutrition label nutrition label high quality rice reveals almost identical nutritional values - perhaps because koala crisp high quality rice . just rice never claimed fully balanced meal , neither koala crisp . what it , high quality product made high quality ingredients ( none artificial vitamins minerals added " grocery store " cereals make them look better ) . it designed used part balanced diet . out way , it just plain good . i buy it case , eat it several times per week breakfast , i like it much . no , i no connection company all - i just love their products ( many them - not just this one ) . now , if they'd just add this one their line eco-pak cereals ( large , bulk bags ) , i'd even happier	1
some people tolerate spelt but not wheat -- if you one those , spelt flour makes great bread . it substitutes well , but aware spelt requires less kneading ( it shorter gluten fiber breaks down if kneaded too long . we knead bread three minutes . ) spelt also makes lovely noodles fine cakes . it seems easier digest . it gluten relative wheat , so if you gluten-sensitive , this probably not alternative	1
i thought tuna olive oil tasted good but this better . this tuna salad nicoise ; maybe use other mixing tuna salad	1
i tried this item just because it ginseng snack . i found it not particularly tasty , but overall effect increased stamina true . i'm not sure spirulina general , but one ball per day trick me when it comes increased stamina lasting several days	-1
i adore this light version madhava agave because it so versatile . i use it hot cold drinks sweeten without any sort aftertaste . it mixes easily into both . it perfect compliment tea or coffee , especially yummy vanilla rooibos ! i also use it place sugar various recipes , especially any dressings . i prefer it honey because it not crystallize it very low gycemic index . when you eat honey it like injecting sugar straight into your bloodstream but agave , while high fructose , slowly released into bloodstream so you don't after sugar crash . use amber variety place maple syrup but use this light version any other type sweetening ! one sweet tooth , agave satisfy ! i'm off make some tea ..	1
i loved idea ease senseo , but i never crazy way coffee tasted . grocery stores not offer much way variety , so i decided take chance order columbia blend amazon . i very happy flavor it compared what i getting . if you up change want smoother flavor , but still strong tasting coffee . give it try ! i note bag only comes 16 pods vs . 18 regular bags	-1

certainly there more expensive teas , but i've yet better cup than twinings earl grey , which perfect blend comfort spice . it works brilliantly " good morning , how you , " or " rest well , sweet dreams " sort beverage . many other earl greys market struggle proper blending bergamot oil , which quite overwhelming if overdone ; but , it what makes earl grey unique , so one want able taste it . too many other tea companies cannot seem grasp this delicate balance , but twinings always gotten it just right . tea enjoyed au naturel or slight dash cream ... not too much , because you don't want drown out enjoyable , lively flavor bergamot . me , when it comes cup hot tea , this simply best .	1

granted , this not one better tasting cereals , but when you consider it provide daily recommendation fiber just 2/3 cup , trade-off worthwhile . if there easier way get 26 grams fiber , i haven't found it . just aware , if you prefer sugary sweet cereals , this definitely not one you	-1

i don't like plain coffee but even more , i don't need or like all calories fat come using flavored coffee creamers . even sugar-free creamers ton fat , part which hydrogenated/partially hydrogenated . flavor blends coffee wonderful alternative fatty creamers . easy use they come portable small packages you take you anywhere . this not creamer but more flavored " sugar " . one packet gives yummy , subtle hazelnut flavor but without too sweet way some things splenda .	1

seriously folks , shop around all you like , but you cannot beat this lavazza espresso full bodied not-at-all-bitter taste , whether you making espresso or cappuccino . i've used it least 15 years three different machines - francis francis ! my office machine , rancilio silvia never found substitute . my office right next dean deluca nyc i've tried super expensive espresso blends over $20.00 /pound , nothing comes close . amazon recently out stock ( they often ) i accidentally brought lavazza oro whole beans , thinking they already ground . yuk !, i them ground my local coffee dealer but they no taste compared this . i gave them away got hold my favorite black . amazon price can't beat , believe me i've tried , i get 8 cans time enjoy perfect coffee all day long just like rome ! ciao	1

great coffee bargain when buying it 5 pound bag . california some things better than us here indiana , coffee one them	1
i love these cookies ! only complaint i i ordered case ( 12 boxes ) expiration date 4 weeks day i received shipment . yikes , i still over half case left i've eating them daily ( giving them away) ! i probably not purchase again this vendor this reason alone . however , if you're looking great , organic cookie without trans fats , this nice healthy option	1
okay , so i realize this isn't real veggie ... merely veggie that pureed turned into pea pod shaped chip . but man they good . what more , there aren't any bad ingredients this product they're baked , not fried ! better still , my kid prefers them chips . so while i don't totally win " make your kid love veggies " award this snack , i feel i'm one step closer . oh , i love them too	1
i'm excited find these sale amazon , very reasonable price ! i just tried them first time few days ago , wishing there nearby store carried them . everyone i've given them liked them , even those who not normally healthy eaters . these crisps reminiscent puffy corn snacks ( like cheetos ) , but different light flavor . calorie content similar other chip-type snacks ( 150 per serving ) , but these nutrition benefits peas -- protein ( 5g per serving ) , calcium ( 6% dv per serving ) , iron ( 4% dv per serving ) . i haven't tried ceasar flavor yet , but intend so near future . :	1
green good , course . but what much better than green these truly awesome cookies . pn os beat bootie out any oreo variation -- crunchier , more filling(without smarmy ) , much better taste . ( this goes mint , vanilla , chocolate . ) fast eddie felson -- i love you .	1

i personally like taste this product , but i see others may not . taste unusual , natural tones . i definitely like packaging . standard aluminum cans often start look pretty bad rubbing each other long time , but box zico survived 2-week road trip included some nasty dirt roads just fine .	1
i tried most varieties coconut water this one far best . my wife pickiest person i know even she loved them . i know they slightly expensive . but when you wife pregnant wants coconut water you better get her best	1
my 2 half year old son allergic wheat eggs loves these cookies . he takes them school when there birthday party all other kids want his cookies !	1
this great pack anyone who wants try out new brands coffee ( unflavored ) without wanting buy regular 4-pack	1
i like serving size 1.5 ounces these packs - sometimes 1 ounce just isn't enough . they nice flavor , rather like dry roasted peanuts , since they some spice added ( paprika , onion garlic powder , et al ) i think sugar content little high . i'd given them 5 stars otherwise . nice change oil roasted almonds , which seem too oily me sometimes , or raw almonds .	-1
these pods got best invention yet . they compact , extremely easy use best solution making several very quick cups coffee . fresh ground coffee nice , but there virtually no mess these pods . crema just good ground coffee these used pod holder well one cup filter basket . what more could person want ?!	1
i love this product it just right size me eat lunch or snack crackers . i bought this product my local grocery , but if one buys enough groceries site shipping free there usually discount applies so cost just added benefit . i also send these some our guys iraq they ' keep ' forever , don't require any opener , package easily , package compact easy dispose little room needed . i like this smaller package so i don't leftovers next day . amount more than adequate me one sandwich enough left snack later . i prefer tuna water instead oil , i always hated squeeze water out canned tuna so this easy open package very little liquid great . love this product definitely continue buy	1

i love ese pods . i know some coffee snobs disagree , but i'll take 90% taste 10% work any day . pods , i've starbucks , illy , espressione arabica . i like espressione best . i lived italy 3 years hit coffee bars daily - i know what i like espresso . starbucks bit too rough , too american tasting . suprisingly , though , starbucks pods tasted just like espresso one their stores . very consistent . illy too smooth . it goes well food , after dinner , but i tend take my espresso breakfast , prefer bold , smooth taste . espressione arabica achieves just . i'll buying it again my every day use	-1
i enjoyed those pods more than year my frances frances espresso machine , but today i am little bit concerned fact your price went $37.99 last month $60.00 today ... why ? advantage buying 150 pods once cut down price , if it same price or more expensive than other stores , we still reason purchase them amazon ? please enlighten me ! i would very sorry go elsewhere . thanks	1

these excellent columbian pods deep , rich flavor . perfect medium roast . worked fine me brewed 8 oz . grindmaster opod	1
these three sauces delicious . i think probably most difficult part indian cooking getting right combination spices flavors sauces . these sauces taaza hard work you . practically no time you create delicious meals adding your own fresh ingredients . you add whatever vegetables , meat , or seafood you may hand make complete meals . example , i may add shrimp , bell peppers , onions one sauces . sauce i may add potatoes , cauliflower chickpeas . you come up your own combinations ( even though combinations may not authentically indian , sauces make it seem like they ! ) . also , reading nutritional charts bottles , i know they healthy ( unlike food some indian restaurants loaded calories ) . i know i feed my family rather inexpensively these sauces they taste like they came restaurant . ... my kids love these sauces too	1
