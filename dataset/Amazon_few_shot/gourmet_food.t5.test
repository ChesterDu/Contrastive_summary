**** tazo passion herbal infusion somewhat tart , deep , flavorful ( hibiscus-y tasting ) tea . it not berry-like taste , although it red color . it difficult describe what hibiscus tastes like , but i find it most pleasant taste . my husband says it tastes like pomegranate him . although passion contains licorice root it not sweet . ingredients passion : hibiscus flowers , natural tropical flavors , citric acid , orange peel , licorice root , cinnamon bark , rose hips , lemongrass red poppy . it caffeine-free ! tazo interesting company makes only super premium teas . they socially responsible , based portland , motto , " reincarnation tea " . tazo owned starbucks . their web site fun quirky , zen-type focus , definitely worth checking out . it unclear , though , their web site , how many their ingredients organic or kosher , they use some " natural flavors " their teas -- this wording seems little vague super premium tea . paper tea packet , tazo writes , " tantalizing deep red tea made hibiscus flowers , exotic herbs natural tropical flavors . " their web site , tazo describes flavor profile passion " berry , juicy , wine-like , merlot , sweet , earthy , dense " . tazo describes aroma " sweet , juicy , red fruits " . i would rate this tea , tazo general , very good --- better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings --- but not good numi . i'm soooooo spoiled numi teas , which why tazo passion gets only four stars . ***	-1
