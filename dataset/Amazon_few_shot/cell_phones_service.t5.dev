others mentioned , front window blanks out almost immediately , even worse , it doesn't show your missed calls . you open phone . stupid design . it not any exterior lights , such my old samsung , showed when it charging , when charge completed , when voice mail waiting , etc . this phone needs opened get any info . can't even see time without opening phone . while talking phone it blacks out after 1 minute . i don't like either . it also very hard hear it . especially if car , traffic noise . no , i'm not driving , but i'm passenger trying use my phone . forget it . re color someone mentioned . cingular light pastel pink , tmobile magenta ( dark pink ) . one thing i like this phone quad band , if you travel interationally , it great . i just got phone , so haven't used it interational yet . oh , it must tmobile get international service . phone camera , plus other tech features , but i don't use them . i want my phone only phone , no other gadgets . i would never buy this phone again , soon i'm eligible upgrade this phone history . i doubt i would get motorola ever again , i'll stick samsung .	-1
i bought 2 charges try save buck , but they complete junk . they worked , but never well , month then metal charger tip totally pulled apart unit	-1
looks nice , protects i860 very well . but ... i've only it 3 months , release broke off after 2 months which i rarely used . swivel spins freely now no longer rachets . cover screen housing gets way camera , it held down away lense . body glove needs send this one back engineers	-1
soon i bought it i realized it doesn't hold phone too well . few days later my concerns proved them selves , every time i made rapid movement or tried run it ( even very carefully ) phone would unclamp itself holster slam into ground . every time i lucky realize soon i droped it , untill today when after coming home shoping i realized my z520a no longer me . there goes $200 phone , lost because stupid $10 holster . not buy this product , if you realy need holster go something like sonyericsson " ice-26 " secures phone extra flap top so it dosn't slip out holster . me i gatta get me new phone , shame i z520 cell phone 4 months now i really liked it	-1
this product alone none things listed descrption itself . you must still buy other software use it . when i questioned them why they listed it doing all these things , which it doesn't , they pointed out where it says " may require 3rd party software various uses " . i just didn't know definition ' various ' all uses we listed . i would rate my experience this seller : dissapointingat least let my misfortune warning someone out there somewhere .	-1
i got phone because it small but i didn't know i'd sacrificing so much . speakerphone only works when call picks up my text message inbox fills up basically every day . i get shoddy service while i like design , there lots places where paint chipped away i see thru casing . all all okay phone if all you want it emergencies , but it not really best what you'll want your cell phone .	-1

i got this phone part buy-one-get one free promotion . i changed cingular because i couldn't stand my bill constantly wrong . i560 seemed like good choice first . however , it not resilient advertised . within first two months , my phone already malfunctioned . while talking my wife phone , phone went wacky pound sign appeared my screen . next , all i could hear sound someone holding down phone key . i not even touching phone . phone not respond any keystrokes or even command turn off . once i removed battery placed it back into phone , phone restarted went directly into airplane mode . this most annyoing features this phone i wish you could disable it altogether . my wife phone replaced vendor where we got our phone . mine currently its way motorola repaired . caveat emptor !	-1

this review more virgin mobil customer service than phone . i ordered vox 8610 1/22/2007 online thru virgin mobile . phone wouldn't charge . i called customer service explained problem . they said i want charger or phone . i replied i could not tell if it charger or phone fault so please send new kit . i received phone but not charger it also wouldn't charge . i called customer service explained issue it must charger fault . rep said they would not send new charger , i would purchase one . i said this didn't make any sense , according offer i could return phone full refund mean get new phone charge i need return phones refund then order one get charger ? support rep said yes i make up my mind - either return phone or purchase charger . i asked speak supervisor . customer support rep kept going off line ( talk someone ? ) but refused or couldn't get supervisor talk me . she then asked esn number phone . when i said i didn't know what ' esn ' number she indignantly explained it like serial number back phone . i'm not clear why she needed this , since i haven't activated phone i already referenced order ( vmu ) number . any rate i phone now over 40 min support rep ( obviously not very cost effective virgin mobile ) least she trying track down some info - or so i thought - she finally came back line said computer down she couldn't handle my order - i would call back . i called back , work my way thru answering system got thru rma fellow named mike . mike explained they couldn't send charger ( none stock ) i would send entire phone back - which what i am now doing - 60+ minutes after initial call . i say my interactions virgin mobile so far not positive . they customer service staff obviously poorly trained not empowered make decisions . interfaces support youth geared - not bad thing except when it expense treating adults courteously professionally . i am sending phone back refund re-considering provider pay-as-you-go service . 01/26/2007 .	-1

i just picked up one these my motorola cell phone . it more than enough volume . it comes both right left ear adapter . fits pretty good i medium sized ears . its really light but because it clips your ear earpiece fits slighly your ear you feel you wearing it . it very comfortable though . if you make lot cell phone calls this very good ear headset .	-1
i love these eargels . my ears funny shape i can't wear regular earbuds , but when i add these gels , they fit great don't fall out . they block outside noise make sound quality like those expensive sound-isolating earbuds . sometimes i need small , sometimes i need medium , depending day , weather , how long i use them . ( i gave large size my boss , he loves them too , so don't say you can't use all sizes , guys .	1
my only complaint , consequently 4-star rating , sometimes i don't hear blackberry or feel vibration . apart this holster vast improvement over oem plastic holster	-1

these well worth money your nextel phone ! although it may not list it , experience , these batteries fit 95% all nextel phones . take look your phone battery see if it same shape . color different these white cover . they good twenty dollars cheaper than if you purchased one your local cellular store . plus these never used before ! unlike celluar store battery , these batteries come box , battery shrink wrap , so you know battery not used . when you buy then cellular store , they plastic box opened closed ( you'd never know it ) plus there no shrink wrap ! ever buy battery cellular store it start not holding charge long after only few months ? hmmm , i wonder if you actually new battery or used one ? would you know ???? these batteries well worth it ! buy one or two extra keep charged case emergency or put extra your car or desk those long days	1

i very pleased when i got this cell phone case . i really frustrated my phone before purchasing this case . i kept getting screens dirty every time i made call . guess i oily ears or something . no worries now i this case . things i like this case : 1 . i think it looks cool -- which ... ok mean something me . 2 . it feels good - it kind rubber feel inside cloth3 . it protects my phone - i two boys while they supposed not touch " dads phone " it almost 100% chance getting dropped sooner or later . 4 . its not bulky . 5 . fits phone 95% perfec t.t he things i don't like : 1 . like other guy mentioned clear plastic covers camera little but not big deal , camera not so hot anyhow . 2 . earphone spot awkward . functional but not perfect . so good far far outwieghs bad . i no buyers remorse after surveying options v710 i still think this best	-1

this nice wide color screen amazing clarity picture quality . syncs windows pc ms office ease . great feature off phone battery recharging included second battery . one battery recharge using other until phone dies should keep life battery longer . not worry plugging recharge totally awesome . nice see this feature return . when cellphone first came out this standard feature , then it optional , then it gone . get extra long life battery if you plan use this video or mp3 music player . video conversion bit spotty frustrating . many videos convert then not display . music no problem . any mp3 or ms windows media player audio format play . convert easy windows media player 10 or 11 . sorry win2k users ( forget nt or win9x or me ) , video conversion not available any ms os older than xp windows media player 10 11 only xp . get microsd card put your music card you play it there . pictures also stored sd card or 64megs internal memory . since this ms smartphone , there lots 3rd party software games this phone . aware aspect ratio , this landscape display not portrait . if you get games or applications it sure aspect ratio . this 240h 320w display . size your pictures display you happy clarity sharpness . thumbwheel great navigation web browsing . niggles : 1 . camera slow not very clear , but none camera phones i seen very good either . 2 . need more ring tones . ones come this phone lame best . download or create some your own . 3 . need more menu choices . ones come it ok but take some navigation get around . 4 . hate cingular activation policy cost internet access service ( but not phone fault so maybe i should not list this complaint )	-1
this great skin treo 700 . i used this product four months , brand prior . others noted , it increase thickness somewhat ( but certainly no less than leather cases , etc ) . but " thickness " gains you considerable protection . i dropped my phone concrete several times nary scratch . i like design this unit it leaves keyboard exposed thus it easy type . function buttons under skin , but easy press .	1
this cover best you get your sansa series player . it increases size little but durability worth it . belt clip great cause i use mine gym too . i purchased armband but this much better . it also comes display cover i discovered necessary item , my display began show minor scratches after only couple weeks use , so if you don't buy this , least get little expensive stick covers . toughskin also makes function buttons work little easier . small down side this cover not able get micro-sd slot without removing sansa , but only small issue . my advice , you spent big bucks great little mp3 player so spend little more protect it best you	1

i really like javoskin my treo -- it well made openings so all features treo usable . material soft touch but strong protection . i don't like lanyard they send product , it 24 " long reminds me shoelaces . i prefer smaller , more delicate lanyard would go around my wrist	-1
