these thin solid dark patties cook up tasteless , juiceless unburgerlike texture . completely unlike their advertising unlike regular beef patties sold supermarket . i never buy omaha steak products again . omaha steaks ' customer representatives very nice however . i wrote them telling them my experience they said i could dump scary meat they would credit my card . thank you very much .	-1

whatever thing hot sauce you , dave it double . i also found dave steak sauce makes fabulous " secret ingredient " ( small doses ) spaghetti sauce , stews , anything improves tiny bit heat ( think tabasco only flavor )	1
this coffee smooth not bitter all . it wonderfully aromatic rich flavor . i personally bought beans jamaica but it only $12 12 ounces , i seen such inflated prices internet this product truly it not worth it	1

you get better tea if you're willing deal leaves , but that not practical most us , especially those who drink it work like i . compare this budget-brand bagged green tea ( like salada , which i used drink ) , you'll able tell difference right away . tazo isn't overbearingly flavorful ( no green tea ) , but its subtle " green " taste addictive ( caffeine ! )	1

**** tazo decaffeinated chai black tea enjoyable chai experience most part . paper tea packet , tazo writes , " rich blend full-flavored naturally decaffeinated teas exotic aromatic spices . " their web site , tazo describes flavor profile decaffeinated chai " creamy , vanilla , sweet pungent spices " . tazo describes aroma " sweet spice " . those pretty accurate . black tea " blend " little bitter , though , even minimal brewing . it real trick get it brew long enough get experience flavor spices without tea turn bitter . ingredients decaffeinated chai : naturally decaffeinated black teas , rooibos , cinnamon , ginger , cardamom , chicory , cloves , black pepper , natural flavors , star anise . it caffeine-free ! tazo interesting company makes only super premium teas . they socially responsible , based portland , motto , " reincarnation tea " . tazo owned starbucks . their web site fun quirky , zen-type focus , definitely worth checking out . it unclear , though , their web site , how many their ingredients organic or kosher , they use some " natural flavors " their teas -- this wording seems little vague super premium tea . i would rate this tea , tazo general , good --- better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings --- but not good numi . i'm soooooo spoiled numi teas , which why tazo decaffeinated chai gets only four stars . ***	1
if you like it hot then this you . warning : only gods handle this substance . you lesser beings , just add it recipes :)	1
i've buying these freeze dried strawberries several months use them mainly my cereal . they delicious consistantly high quality . i only one what seemed like excessive strawberry " powder " bottom .	1

pico-balla very subtle candy -- you find yourself eating large amount it if you don't pay too much attention . different colors each differently flavored , you eat this chewy treat slowly or quickly . i like bite off outer layer first then eat inside , but my wife eats inside part first . just very different candy what we used -- it doesn't taste overly " sugary " , won't feel like you greasing your mouth fructose , etc ... give it try . i wish i bought two boxes . i wish amazon offered balla-balla , too . i can't wait try sometime , but i would rather wait until i get it good price . amazon price 66% world market price , even less what online candy stores sell it . take chance it .	1
this best candy i ever . my aunt gave everybody christmas this candy red box , what great gift . it doesn't help my atkins diet , but i've got my chocolate	1
this delicious basic thai yellow curry , some vegetables . it comes little pouch cooked rice soak up sauce balance meal , but i still found this meal , i really crave some chicken or some heartier addition like paneer cheese cubes , nuts , or eggplant . i don't any thai places my area , so i add some chicken pine nuts round it out it really helps thai craving . sauce delicious veggies crisp	1
this sauce medium heat everyday use . it excellent roasted pepper flavor , there * no vinegar * get way . consequently , you get exactly what one should expect pepper sauce ... versatility flavor not try smother character food you season it . every-day sauce should not leave patina your tongue . this not boutique novelty , it household staple . 32 oz . size right size hot sauce household . you want good ? try tapatio cottage cheese . you'll never eat cottage cheese any other way again , i promise . i use it just anything except cereal ice cream , but my personal favorite applications tapatio : eggspotatoespizzaanything creole ( forget tabasco ! )cottage cheesemost ricemac cheeseand course ... mexin my opinion , this best sauce your local grocery store	1
my husband , non-celiac , eat this pancake mix ( make waffles ) all time . recipe calls egg whites beaten until stiff , so it bit more work than many other mixes . but , it worth it ! result tastes like * real * waffles . kinnikinnick mix also makes good tasting waffles , but texture isn't nice	1
sure , it not 100% pure vanilla extract . that indicated quite clearly ingredients . molina vanilla made mixture pure vanilla extract synthetic vanillin . personally i love its strong distinctive flavor , regardless what percentage pure vanilla extract it . those who feel it too strong , use half amount listed recipe . i know couple people who this when using molina vanilla . again , i like flavor , so i use full amount called recipe . this stuff great flavor really kicks things up notch	1

stella d'ora fudge cookies best dessert i could find my lunchbox growing up . its crisp cookie fudgie middle perfect milk or hot tea . many times i would eat cookie part save fudge center last test my patience because there nothing like eating chocolate . stella d'ora brand common nyc grocery stores ( throughout nj ) , so everytime i would visit relatives there i would buy breakfast cookies , annisettes , fudge cookies . i seen breadsticks nc but nothing else so its so nice find amazon them . stela d'ora always seemed so refined since they italian adults who liked little treat their coffee or cappucinos . my father used dunk his cookies coffee they would become warm gooey , while i preferred them crisp milk . either way , try package this some other biscuits . they really unbelievably good .	1
this very good product . it keeps you try mix your own cinnamon sweetener . it good lot things those who can't sugar . my favorite cinnamon toast . i reorder it when i am out it . it so nice something splenda instead aspartame	1
i expecting good thing after all positive reviews . it even better than i'd hoped . first container entirely devoted fluffer nutters . i fight my boyfriend second container he could eat real stuff if he wanted ! once i down just little fluff stuck sides container , i used strawberries ( alright , occasional finger ) scrape last it out . great product one thing , but this company great customer service , too . i called store because i question one their products . they extraordinarily helpful friendly . even though they very busy , i wasn't rushed off phone . they treated me like my business mattered great deal them . this rare thing find today corporate landscape where customer treated like most unimportant cog machine	1
