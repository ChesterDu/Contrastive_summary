this second batch i ordered . i contact representatives brucepac both times complain quality product they kindly send me replacement jerky . i enjoyed same world kitchen jerky other vendors so i cannot understand why order amazon such disappointment .	-1

there bugs tea bags . now , these aren't ' organic ' bugs you find your garden when you plant veggies . these bugs dig into expired produce . there 4-5 bugs each bag . if you want some protein boost while relaxing before you go bed , this product buy . also , tea bags aren't made organdy . it some sort plastic/polyester . i burnt bag it melted , turned black , glued onto itself . horrible , unethical company	-1
this peanut butter tastes even worse than regular creamy skippy . lack flavor dry texture makes me wonder if " palm oil " they meant write " socks " . thoroughly disappointing , i only finished one jar i bought because peanut butter staple my diet i wasn't waste it . buy real all natural peanut butters or even cheap store brand which contains fully hydrogenated oils which fine you unlike partially hydrogenated ones	1
these excellent graham crackers . we love ' em , kids too , it not often we agree . but you'll sorry if you order graham crackers -- or any other food damaged shipping -- amazon . our recent order arrived original box factory , containing 12 boxes new morning honey grahams . it . no packing material . nothing shield crackers drops shocks shipped us . so we didn't get graham crackers . we got graham crumbs , few graham cracker fragments . all means , order these crackers . just don't order them amazon . instead , find retailer knows how it right , or buy them your local grocery . unless you really want graham cracker crumbs ..	-1
title wrong , this item contains twelve . 5-grams ( 0.0175 ounce ) packets , not twelve . 5-ounce packets .	-1
soft , chewy , little grainy but good flavor . mine expired week after i bought whole 12 pack :( don't expect whole berries . basically everything ground together . odwalla bar much better . definitely try spirelina balls , though little bit green flavor energy/ginsing one well worth cost here- not almost expired ..	1
beyond glaring fact most their products aren't tomatoes , this one blight just tomatoes ethos . " just . " but it two ingredients . it not " just " anything if it includes both bananas strawberries . they don't call cracker jack " just peanuts , popcorn , high fructose corn syrup . " nor it " just " something when it comes package 2 . they don't call variety pack cereal " just grains high fructose corn syrup . " just tomatoes folks deserve credit their aspirations purity but this just goes beyond it . it goes against mimalist reductive concept absolutely roccoco . it just not right	1
i love granola cereal general , but i say this very best granola i ever . people bear naked philosophy i love , which back every bag : " we believe food should hand-made wholesome natural ingredients you actually pronounce . " although i eat processed food , i appreciate appeal more traditionally prepared foods , this granola tops list nutrition taste . like most granola , it high calories fat , but take note fat comes largely nuts contained ( it also contains expeller pressed canola oil ) , it no trans fat , only 1.5 saturated fat per serving . this cereal softer than most granola , though not soft enough me consider it chewy . it large chunks nuts also contains cranberries flax seed , optimal nutritional digestive health . six-pack sold amazon makes price per package reasonable ( ingredients quite expensive ) , so value proposition , i think this not only great product , but great buy . delicious nutritious : great combination i recommend highly	1
i'm vegetarian although my husband isn't , he enjoys this soup just much . tofu mix creates creamy texture . if you're expecting " potato au gratin " flavor , you disappointed ... however , if you've made homemade miso soup scratch like taste , this product makes excellent time-saving substitute . tofu serves source protein seaweed provides medicinal minerals . this soup excellent drink when sick remarkably soothes sour stomach . my local health food store charges $5.30 per box 4 packets . amazon sells it $2.66 box . substantial savings	1

this 100% organic , unrefined coconut oil . yes , it tastes like coconut , but it supose . food should taste like what it ! nutritional value this food outstanding . it contains lot lauric acid which also found mothers milk both antifungal antimicrobial . it stable room temperature not become rancid quickly like other popular cooking oils . it requires very high heat release free radicals ( i prefer red palm oil high heat cooking options because it not release free radicals all ) . my suggested uses : smoothies , slow cooked baked goods , sauteed foods , mixed maple syrup over popcorn , homemade cosmetics , occasional conditioner dry ends long hair .	1
tried senseo pods , millstone , etc . i surprised good old folgers just good some cases better than senseo newer flavors . while made home cafe these fit senseo coffee makers give you good cup lot less than more upscale brands	1

hearty , grea t-t asting cereal . whole grain flavor . originally looked it because lower carbs than other cereals ( which better my reduced carb diet ) . but it quickly become favorite cereal buying six boxes time through amazon.com nets out lower cost per box than buying it local grocery stores .	1
my kids love their macaroni cheese but one day all we generic brand . they didn't eat it all well ( kraft really best ) so i decided try make it little better them . follow recipe box couple exceptions . put one slice velveeta chees while melting butter ( i melt butter while noodles draining so melt butter velveeta faster ) add 1/3 cup milk . what you'll less expensive version really creamy macaroni cheese kraft sells lot more money . adding extra milk cheese they're even getting more calcium . my kids love it when i throw hot dogs even peas so feel free throw other things since it so cheesy ( extra cheesy sauce take things like peas kids don't normally eat make them taste good ) . give it try see what you and/or your kids think	1
this " optimum power " breakfast cereal contains wheat , oats , barley , soy , flaxseeds something nature path calls " kamut " which look like puffed oats . also there freeze-dried blueberries , few anyway , delightful subtle cinnamon flavor hits you . ingredient list contains few other things probably good you . now third ingredient 16-ingredient list - these lists supposed order according percentage largest first - something called " organic evaporated cane juice " . now what but organic sugar ? this probably accounts cereal somewhat sweet , reviewer noted . but it nowhere near sweet those tooth-decaying , empty-caloried , mass-marketed cereals most americans feeding their children . no , this cereal well within tolerance us " granolas " who don't dowse everything sugar , ketchup supermarket mayonnaise . ( no , i don't mean cereal . just making point . ) so when you pour this out box , you see lot extruded , elongated brown rod-shaped thingies , quite few healthy-looking chubby flakes , some those exploded oat-looking morsels probably kamuts here there desiccated blueberry . gawd , when i get started writing like this , i can't stop , i just get more so . better not review anything else tonight . you'll never want eat this . actually , my description thingies could far more graphic devilish . you'll see . please try this cereal , you'll like heartiness , cinnamoniness ( new word ? ) relatively light sweetness . i give it five stars , didn't i	1

this very high quality snack which combines hearty , solid granola irresistable double chocolate . i really love this product -- chocolate lover dream . yet , it surprisingly healthy not too sweet . fat/sugar content comparable most other granolas . i've tried numerous granola over years , this one special . probably not most nutritious granola overall , but it definitely treat tastebuds welcome relief ordinary granolas . i would not this my exclusive source granola , but i buy this many more times future satisfy my chocoholic cravings . fact , i probably always keep this product handy because it highly satisfying . great breakfast , snack or dessert . yummy	1
first things first , you not treated classic ' cooking ' smell . fact , your appetite better off not catching whiff magnesium-salt concoction heats your meal . think happy thoughts , oblivious . why ? because meal itself actually pretty good ( airtight separation ' oven ' ) . package also includes plastic spork , knife , napkin . basically , ingredients on-par what you would typically find canned stew ( similarly need not refrigerated ) . however , meal loses one star because serving size fairly small . 210 calories isn't whole lot go , particularly if you must engage strenuous physical activity under low-temperature conditions . pros : lightweight , keeps well , cooks itself , easy disposal , tastes good . cons : cost storage space per calorie somewhat high . if you creative , you might able figure way cook something else using box oven	1

" ... made without hydrogenated oils - which good thing since it difficult our bodies absorb trans-fatty acids come hydrogenated oils . " ~ box these definitely natural snack crackers bounce around . i mean , it so rare find even natural foods without hydrogenated oils . i can't count times i've read labels only disappointed find " natural " not always mean healthy . ingredients : certified organic wheat flour , expeller pressed safflower oil , aged cheddar cheese ( contains milk , salt , enzymes , cheese culture ) , salt , yeast extract , paprika , annatto extract ( color ) , ground celery seed , onion powder , yeast . i've made my own cheese crackers these really taste homemade . 24 tiny crackers satisfy any cheese cracker craving 70 calories . these crackers bernie bunny ( annie beloved mascot ) approved . they also made only vegetarian ingredients . each cracker cutest bunny shape . ~ rebecca review	1

this probably one best granolas i've tasted . what i like most it texture . too many granolas just break your teeth when you eat them - but this one firm ( ie . not mushy ) but pliable texture . next thing i enjoyed this cereal taste - not too sweet nor too bland - just perfect balance . too often sweetened cereals much too sweet - or , flip side , " healthy " cereals too bland . finally - this cereal just plain healthy !! what great combo - flax pumkin seeds !! we ate up this cereal record time ordering more today !	1
