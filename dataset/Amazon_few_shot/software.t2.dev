this program average below average it abilities . said , just hope you don't need any roxio tech support . why ? because roxio support bites ! you cannot contact anyone online or email help ; whenever their dis-functional " web portal " [ web-based support ] system traps you endless loop . i needed couple simples updates pc not allowed internet . it used you could download roxio patches any pc internet access . then burn patch[s ] cd , or copy floppy/jumpdrive . then " sneakernet " patches pc needing them . no more . what happened today their webpage apparently trying download/patch roxio product directly my pc . [ ezcd5 doesn't exist my pc ] . instead simply letting me download it somewhere , like my hard drive , vs patchging it directly their webpage my pc , [ which won't work my case i'm not using roxio , nor it installed my pc ]; apparently morons roxio webpage coding make download/patch process stop/end proceed send customer back roxio initial patch download page . when you need patch , all these endless loops support gamesare enough get me looking different product/different company . if you want minimize human contact customers , fine . but let folks least download patches they need order keep their pc going . don't hand over your customer support system [ almost ] completely web server . ignorant arrangement works well when companies try save few pennies get rid phone receptionists customer service telephone calls . then they let customers wade through 100 layer deep voicemail system find answer simple problem . it just doesn't work . if company won't provide access patches , even after i logged into their website username password , [ so they know accessing their patches ] they don't offer any type ftp site download backup option , then i sure heck won't buying anymore their products . i see why roxio bought up cequadrat other companies . [ though i hate see such quality companies devoured like ] . when competitor better product , why fight improve your prodsuct quality/features , when you buy other company out . thank goodness nero not under roxio umbrella .	-1

i recently purchased hp laptop , my regret , came pre-load win vista . some bad things this package : 1 . help files all line . if i'm not connected internet , i can't access help files . 2 . hp ship it laptops vista install cd . instead , cd purchase upgrade next version vista included . 3 . newer laptops , hp not producing drivers any other os except vista . 4 . vista less user friendly than xp or even 2000.5 . yes , vista looks familiarly like os , but harder work . i owned several apples looks deceiving . just because it looks like apple doesn't mean it works like one . 6 . all my instructional software no longer works . i use lot software teach information security no longer works vista , such : . cyberciege ( information security wargame ) . boson ccna network simulator . visual studio ( not everything works)7 . also , some network management tools not run or run properly vista . i lot remote management workstation versus going server . many vendors provide tools way behind power curve their vista support . i could go but what point ? i can't even dump vista go back windows xp or even 2000 if hp won't even make attempt produce drivers laptop . linux out same reason , no drivers . so i'm basically stuck overpriced emailer word processor . if you plan purchasing computer , make sure if you plan dumping os going back xp or changing linux , vendor all drivers support change not microsoft vista conspiracy bandwagon	-1
this thing nightmare . first , it impossible understand unless you already know how run some other comparable system . next , it requires huge amount fiddling buffers ( believe me -- read help files this , which huge suggest ten different things when your music doesn't sound good , trust me , it won't , either before or after unlimited tweaking ) . finally , it actually not export it says it . it lost my files , including one song i cannot quite reproduce ( gone forever ) . bottom line : if your idea fun spending two weeks vacation fiddling software not work never work , then all means , buy this garbage . i using computers since 1985 , this , i think , worst single product i've ever seen . other hand , if you want actually make music , you might want try sony acid pro 6 , which you try out free ( company thinks you'll like it , whereas sadists cakewalk must know perfectly well you won't , hence no demo ) .	-1

i really like omniform 5 . actually i'm using version 5.1 i'm very satisfied it . i using forms program i purchased adequate but not nearly good . after using formtool i much greater appreciation omniform . scansoft my list not buy software recently because some poor performance some their other programs , tech support expensive scansoft none their software i used easy learn using manuals or help files . contrast omniform well worth money . omniform 5 great job either creating forms scratch , scanning or converting pdf . it only forms program i tried so far actually great job importing form pdf file . its all tools you need create form starting blank page . you define any field variety formats . example you create date field specific format then no matter how data input program automatically reformat data way you specified . you create just any field simply dragging symbol menu onto page . case inserting graphic you choose graphic saved form or not saving form itself conserve file size . you graphic resized program little loss quality . features such these might available other programs this type but i found omniform best job creating form field field least effort . scanning form almost flawless . it even recognized fields paper form meant circled created field them . other programs i used could not this well if all . only adjustments i make scanned forms sometimes omniform recognized text bold when it wasn't occasionally it would change font . example it would change arial times new roman some spots form . strange quirk . get form imported pdf file you open pdf file print omniform . this very accurate little adjustment necessary after import . omniform really shines this area . but i notice if form your importing pdf multiple pages omniform give you out memory error when you try save . overcome this flaw you import one page time , creating new page each time omniform make multi page form pdf . little time consuming when you 9 page form . it create self running . exe form you e-mail person other end fill out form send it back . this works even other person not omniform their machine . because some people filter out . exe file attachments program also creates . html version form . this very handy feature . help file not much use . paper manual better but still lacking . if you problems tech support scansoft expensive . but there user support forum you get through support page scansoft web site . i used forum great success . overall this program little difficult use some quirks needed features like able import save multiple page form pdf . but well worth effort use it most accurate forms program i used . i recommend this program . if flaws i mentioned corrected i would give this program 5 stars	1

bought this usb gps just before christmas my trips virginia dc . weigh it against similar product garmin . but price , usability track record microsoft user reviews persuaded me towards this ms product . i must say , this excellent value money . not only it it give unambiguous directions ( voice ) , other feature like gps trail help you determine how lost you actual route . also you recalculate route your current position . voice giudance one or two instances bit slow , but i pretty much got adequate time make turns merges nearly all instances . extremely useful during night driving when it becomes difficult read street names . maps very detailed some cool features like " nearest items " ( gas statn , railways stn , bus terminals , restaurants , hotes , etc ) impressed me very much . since this plugs into your laptop , its best suited your navigator , although i make long trip laptop front seat just listening voice driving directions . but since it not call out street names but shows it display , you would neeed look screen which ofcourse dangerous . it say " wrong route " when you go ofcourse but you'd need hit button relculate route your current position . all said , less than $100 this stuff rocks !!	1
