when internal rechargable battery dies so uni t.t he power cord not power shaver once battery no longer hold charge . you cannot replace regargable battery yourself ! sending unit factory repair after its warranty cost you more than buying new one . shave : not bad , but not exceptional either . cutters very tiny , not built last , not durable . all rechargable batteries limited life depening conditions how they used . this shaver may last you few months - year , 2 3 years stretch . i also braun norelco , norelco 10years old running fine , braun 15 years - both original cutters foil - i heavy duty clean them 97% alchohol once year , brush out debris once every 7 uses , these units dont batteries this why i purchased remington acess when there no power plug available . remington shaver really needs it cutter blades cleaned ( brushed off or washed ) after every use ( what pain) ! i find this shaver waste money it more akin disposable electric shaver - than one last	-1

get hot lather , which nice , you first get device installed top . i would not recommend this if you easily frustrated . directions provided sparse several languages . first you pry top off shaving cream . they provide pry tool purpose which works well some brands shaving cream better than others . then you fit device top . it worked well one brand large size . when i tried it smaller size shaving cream it emptied half during installation process . using different brand large , i trouble prying top off . if you time patience , willing spend some money various brands shaving cream find one works well , give it try . otherwise , forewarned it may lead frustration bad language . it would nice if companies intending sell products us ( apparently manufactured somewhere asia ) would provide clear set instuctions english , reasonable large readable type , illustrations . this case , they need clearly specify type shaving cream unit designed . i not need instructions foreign languages , get tired limited instructions six languages	-1

i recently purchased this lumbar support cushion gift my father this past christmas . i am physical therapist , over 5 years experience dealing primarily mechanics mechanisms low back pain disc dysfunction . i tried out many cushions over years , my experience , this product good any higher-priced product same intent . composite board insert allows consistent shape maintained , so cushion not yield easily body weight over years consistent use , burgundy cover removable washable . it also excellent size average-sized person ( my dad approximately 5'9 " , ~ 170 lbs . ) . it provides good side-bolster support well added feeling comfort around outiside lower back . i highly recommend this cushion when placed comparison other similar products . most other products out there contention this one composed unnecessary additives , like massager , ribbing contours cushion , etc . i've found simply maintaining good posture ( not only sitting , but all activity ) allows so much more freedom pain simple ease back into daily life . again , i highly recommend this product anyone out there searching answer help alleviate low back pain ; however , i must caution commercial products not cure-all one problems . it always possible alleviate pain symptoms , but other steps necessary terms fixing problem . i highly recommend seeking out professional care physical therapist , it more than likely necessary one would need ( least ) proper education intevention help one get better .	1

if you suffer folliculitis , this may just razor you waiting ! i tried mach 3 few different times over years but all it would take just one shave , boom !, my face would break out folliculitis . although gillette claims mach 3 reduces irritation , i always found it super irritating . two things seem different fusion . closer spacing blades seems genuinely reduce irritation i found mach 3 . mach 3 always seemed dig into my face scrape away layers skin . not so fusion ! second , it seems me way fusion shaver cartridge mounted handle makes better angle shave . i haven't noticed gillette makes any claim way fusion blade mounted any different mach 3 , but still , i think it slightly different . i always felt like leading edge mach 3 shaver cartridge too sharp angle against my skin . it seems like fusion avoids this mounting " hinge " farther back shaving cartridge . thus , rubber fins front blades makes cartridge ride more level or flat over face . truly improvement however it achieved ! also , before i used fusion , i thought five blades little ridiculous . i figured you could never get close front ears , under nose , etc . however , i found five blades aren't ridiculous . special trimmer blade nice but i find i don't hardly need it . i get into close spaces generally without it . end , i used fusion enjoyed totally comfortable shave ! no folliculitis outbreaks resulted my use it ! i really like razor	1

pro : shave close blades . it may take while , but it get job . ( based just my person experience , comparing braun 1000 , 4000 . 500 , 8000 , new norelco speedxl , panasoic linear ) . con : poor build quality all area , look feel , fits noise level ( loud ) , shake , power connector , so . ( new norelcos similar problems - look feel cheap . far less solid than my old faithful quadra . braun panasoic feel better build . brauns pleasure my eyes hands . but unfortunately , no one shaves close remington)and it shaver after all it supposes shave . if this remington doesn't last ( i my reasons bit worried ) , i get one same . only hope remington least keep their technology intact over time . ( side note , among all auto cleaning systems , one comes braun 8000 series really works : fast , clean , easy get shaver out station , charge wash separately . too bad remington doesn't come close washer technology , braun doesn't cut close ! ) p.s. i no beard or mustache , but lots whiskers all directions around under chin . all other shavers i've tried simply won't go there . difference loud clear , literally : when whiskers got cut down , you hear it . all shavers work great initial cutting phase . but only remington continues after , while all others just empty runs , my fingers clearly tell me there're more cut . bottom line : try it . don't get scared away bad raps web . i tried remington my last resort . i never regret i	1

sunbeam flexible heating pad some nice features . built elastic bands hold it place . it wrap easily around any body part . it relativly comfortable , except over-sized connector pad power cord which always digging some part your body . but real problem heating . pad heats well 5 minutes then shuts off . unit shows its , but there no heat . unit not heat up again half hour . like many cheaper heating pads , i believe this some kind thermal-couple saftey kicks out certain temperture . then fails kick back until unit cools completly . i found this heating pad many high end features comfort , but heats like cheap heating pad . heat what heating pad all . its reason after owning many heating pads i willing dish out almost $40 this heating pad . heat . sunbeam just doesn't deliver . finally after using this heat pad 2 dozen times , it started smell like burning plastic . so garbage it goes . $39 down drain . after alittle product study i found real high end heating pads thermophore theratherm . check out their customer satisfaction amazon . i just purchased theratherm because you set temperture degrees . it seems work well , but early tell . i'll update future	-1

here few positives negatives i hope help :( +) it work , however some places-like your bikini line-where hair tends lay flat you need pull skin tight . (-) it hurts , bad . it slow painful process . (+) hair doesn't nearly long if you waxing . (-) hair goes everywhere . there no little storage area hair , this thing just rips it out flies it all over room . you it tub . (+) it easy clean , brush comes it works well , but i wish they gave extra one because i just know bristles start sticking out any-which-way after while . (-) battery not very good , you keep it plugged if you plan using it more than fifteen minutes . (+) it came cute bag store it . (+) i haven't shaved two weeks ! i probably wont two . bottom line i like it , i'm happy it continue use it . i wish i could gotten better one but i couldn't get shipping hawaii more pricey ones	1

clipper comes one speed , which not disappointing . two speed clipper tends get too hot this could severly hurt or damage small dog tender skin . it all you need begin , including clipper oil nice hard plastic suitcase type case . clipper oii comes so tiny , i'd suggest purchasing larger sized clipper oil separately , if possible it ready your first job	1
i agree others here they not everyone or every situation . my professional life , i constantly take them off put them . i huge head initially i some problems them coming apart . you need adjust experiment bit . after giving them second chance , i enjoy them lot . i used search everywhere pair my reading glasses . now my biggest problem crumbs . when properly adjusted , they work well . they only limited range lens strengths , however . they easy peer over ... bit more sporty or dare i say macho than pair chain	1
here why .... i searched high low decent lighted makeup mirror similiar one i years . my old mirror windmere , lasted 12 years . prior i clairol ( lighting just ok ) . days web searches led me those horrible round halo lighted mirrors ( they just look good counter ) serve no purpose . this jerdon basically same mirror my old windmere . very sturdy , great lighting , large rectangle mirror , side mirrors , vertical 360 ' rotation , 5x magnification reverse side mirror 11 mirror positions , also extra electrical outlet front appliances . issue regarding previous reviewers complaints lighting . you must hold button down 3 seconds allow bulbs light . lighting this mirror superior others i seen . it weighs 6 lbs folds nicely away . negatives this mirror : bulbs make slight buzzing noise when use ( typical this type bulb ) electrical outlet installed upside down my product , therefore mirror must collapsed lower position allow enough room plug . i consider these minor complaints considering product services all my needs . if you want go out house looking like you intend , this mirror you . i would definitely buy again	1

nude bill blass my signaturefragrance since 1996 . i've wearing it so long i don't even smell it anymore when i put it . little behind ears pulse point my neck i'm good go . never , ever i ever worn scent garnered more compliments than nude me . people love it me ! it just lovely , sexy fragrance . however , i would recommend , before buying it online if you've never worn it before , one should go department store try it first . get opinion your husband or boyfriend or good friends because fragrances tend smell differently different people . my sister plopped down $40 bottle nude years ago after smelling it me . her husband told her it smelled awful , lol ( now , mind you , he always complimented me when i it ) . she ended up giving it me going back what she used before .	1

i've tried many pheromones consider myself something " expert " . i'm not biochemist , so take this what it worth : androstenone pheromone which attract attention women , but only some women only when they're ovulating . so if you want one-night stand hookup , get something lot androstenone ( like pherone d-17x , which i'm also reviewing ) . problem androstenone it also quickly intimidating or turn women off if they're not ready it . so better choice product like m-11 which other pheromones " modulate " androstenone ( doesn't too much androstenone ) . this one turn women but doesn't scare them off . other hand , if you're all intimidating kind guy , what you really need my favorite one , v-5 , which no androstenone all . v-5 my every-day phero , i use m-11 going out clubs . it works me ! way , if you smell it means your using too much . some other companies make " odor free " pheromones . what really means they don't put much phero their products . so just use little bit . dab'll ya	1

these diapers fantastic ! i myself prefer cloth diapers , but because we high water table if we much laundry our septic backs up into our house - yuck ! i am also severely chemically sensitive so scent " normal " diapers even seventh generations ones gel make me ill . but these great !! they made wood pulp/paper feel if there cotton them . they no chemical scent all feel nice soft smooth my fingers . they close means adhesive strip either side closes onto larger piece thin plastic either side . if you accidentally close adhesive strip paper it tear when you pull it back off usually not reseal . this not problem if you use them only once . we potty our baby so sometimes we take it off put it back few times before it gets wet or dirty . other than accidentally sticking strips paper i haven't problem using them like this . there elastic legs but it basically encased so it isn't contact skin they snug enough my baby legs . these little harder tell if they wet than seventh generation ones ( i've never used regular diapers since i can't get near them their chemical scent ) because there isn't gel . i usually just put finger it then touch finger my thumb then i tell if i feel dampness or not . if my baby pees lot though it easy tell if it wet ... even outside because it look little more molded form , but not feel damp outside inside less damp even then than cloth diaper . packaging says you should not let baby put these his/her mouth since it paper tear off their mouth it should not held near flame - again because it made out paper . but all said , these not flimsy all , they well made hold up just well regular disposable . i highly recommend these anyone who whom cloth diapers just isn't possible or those times when impractical ( day care ) those people who want limit their baby exposures chemicals	1
we used our fsa balance two purifiers , other hunter quietflo . this rabbit air purifier great . house smells lot fresher . we dog two cats , my husband i suffer certain allergies , we live humid south - it amazing how much dust odor we breathing . this machine quiet easy use . sensors seem work very well - opening front or back door , dog walking past it , cooking smoke or odor - so i leave it auto most time . comparison , hunter quietflo ( 30119 ) lot less expensive , two filters , only one control knob . so far , it captured only smaller particle dust where rabbit air gets small larger particle dust some fur . " o-o zone " much better . i've tried purifier sharper image which not capture much only made air smell like ozone - gave me headaches ! i definitely recommend this brand room air purifier over others . it worth money	1
