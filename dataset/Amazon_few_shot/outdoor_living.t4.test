after experiencing same thing many here witnessed ( after 8 hours smoker didn't get hot enough , i finish my meat oven ) , i decided ask char-broil support their website what i remedy situation . their answer , i quote , " thank you your response . purchase replacement parts , please contact grill lover 1-800-241-8981 24 hours day 7 days week place order . we apologize inconvenience . if you any further questions or concerns , please let us know .

sorry say it , i've liked oregon scientific products past , but this junker . two chief problems . first it doesn't know how switch over daylight savings time correctly . i understand switch-over dates changed this year , but this more recent model clock , older rm826a no trouble this year . i got up hour late first daylight savings time sunday march . sadly , even if you manually set rm323a correct time , it reset overnight wrong time . only way fix this ( per oregon scientific web site ) turn off radio connection atomic clock , thereby defeating reason owning this clock first place . ( fairness , o-s says it work fine after april 1 , but what future years when dates change around ? my guess same problem . ) second problem it very difficult use , including such basic stuff setting alarm . granted , oregon scientific clocks don't lot buttons , so it little complicated handle all functions . but this particular clock both " single alarm " " weekly alarm " goes off every day same time , selecting which one , setting alarm time , even just turning off alarm anything but obvious . i suppose world time capability could useful some folks , but i find this clock worse every respect than rm826a , which no longer manufactured . i'm going toss this one trash find couple rm826a before they're no longer available . oregon scientific no more stock couple days ago	-1

this great clock . looks good , makes no noise , very easy read . setup should simple , but i would suggest adding button change manual automatic . you usually don't get clock midnight you want setup it right beginning . since it not going able sync early afternoon , you want set time manually leave clock sync night . but this where additional button comes handy , cause moving hands same button its hard know if clock left automatic or not	1
