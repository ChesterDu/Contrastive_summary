this product not dry my hair described box . it straighten my hair , but all . i dry my hair blow dryer then use this t3 iron which eliminates whole reason buying it .	-1
i just purchased small bottle(thank god ) ojon ultra hydrating shampoo conditioner . it seems like it made my hair little softer , but smell horrendous . i gotten worst headache smell this product . so overall it may make my hair feel softer , but there no way i put this stuff my head again . rest going trash	-1
i loved smell magazines so i decided get it . well ... it good first ... then i got tired . it smells little cheap sort like pine . i sometiems use it , but let me tell you it smells good your armpits ( that what i use it ) . i think this smell reminds me some kind cologne worn tooo long	1
although it great others love this product , i not get same streak good luck . i using clinique years , merely because it affordable lot people i knew used it . however , every time i took pictures i couldn't help but cringe after i saw way my face looked . i'm naturally tan person , but when i wore clinique foundation ( i used honey 07 ) it would make my face look extremely pale ghostly , compared rest my body . it got point where i got so upset i went back clinique counter macy insisted this just couldn't right color me . they insisted it correct color didn't even bother trying new shades me , even though i gone back couple different times . overall , i really miserable this product . lady , i want look my best . i definitely don't want look like someone who doesn't know how put her makeup , but whenever i took pictures saw way i looked , i couldn't help but think everyone thinking . those you who may my same problem , i recommend switching over laura mercier . i made switch it best makeup decision my life . my face never looked better	-1
this only lush product thus far i've absolutely hated . smell this downright revolting it doesn't anything my hair . try retread ( my favourite lush conditioner ) , veganese or even american cream over this one	-1
this soap washed really well , but after i rinsed it off , it felt like my skin soapy film over it . it also made my skin feel " stipped " . i not really like this soap instead recommend basis facial products instead	1
i this gloss carney . while i like color , gloss very gooey gloppy it doesn't stay long all . i would not buy it again	1
i found strivectin-sd eye cream nicely textured cream , but it too heavy my skin . this rather strange , i dryish skin around my eyes like heavier eye cream . this one clogged up my orbital area so much i got millia ( which i never suffered before ) . cream not absorb very well , but feels good touch . terms wrinkles , i 0 effect . i my late 20 am strating notice first crow feet . strivectin-sd nothing alleviate them . i express opinion price though . if you like product it works you , price should not issue , tube lasts forever . i used it 6 months easily am now getting concerned eye products should thrown away after such long time . yet it hasn't run out yet . i give it 2 out ot 5 - nice texture . impressive advertising campaign convinced me try it !	1
i received vanilla grapefruit sticks gift one my boys . sticks very thin only burn halfway down entire length . re-lighting useless bc there no fragrance left bottom half stick burn . scent doesn't remind me vanilla grapefruit- more like plain burning sticks , which won't cost you $13 . votivo candles well , but aromatic sticks leave something desired . not worth money .	1
love when amazon deletes all reviews product ! well , this one used 3 five-star ratings . i added my two cents- this product nothing me whatsoever . so , some people love it . i don't get it . , it pretty much opposite anti-oxidant , so doesn't make sense . i pointed this out my review . wonder if vendors choice delete all reviews if they get one bad enough ? also , it listed $45 amazon well . same supplier . huh	-1
i paid $100.00 tube hylexin because i serious dark circles . unfortunately , i fell hype because i would tried anything says , " significantly reduces dark circles ! " i followed directions waited .... nothing ! i teach business ehtics university . part course involves ethics advertising . i use hylexin example how people duped wording , packaging , etc . please take my word it save yourself some money	-1
this dryed my skin out really bad it didn't even work . dont use this	-1

high beam provides glow or sheen , where my cheeks seem dull . it not look greasy ... i would say it makes skin look healthy vibrant	1
i chi turbo ( 1 " ) , but i got worried after reading some reviews it unreliable . so part reason i wanted buy t3 iron it comes 4-year comprehensive warranty . other difference solid-ceramic plates " infused " tourmaline which i found intriguing . 1-3/8 " wide plates perfect width my long-ish hair . ( i've used 2 inch wide iron , which i found harder maneuver . ) it heats up fast , stays hot . it great job gripping hair without snagging . my hair stays silky straight all day , not feel damaged after while , like it cheaper irons i've used past . thing this iron other irons not well - it really curls . it heat vents sides plates lets you curl your hair twisting it near root pulling it through ( different usual method gripping ends strands then winding up ) . it creates springy curl better than any flat iron i've used . ( however , heating vents make exterior iron hotter touch . so there drawback this function . ) overall , i enjoy using this flat iron . very happy this purchase . eta : i've learned hairart not honor warranty unless you buy it authorized distributor ( e.g. , sephora ) . so you might want check before you place your order	1
i very pleased this purchase . perfume arrived packaged nicely actually bigger than i expected 1 oz . . i love scent definately buy more when this one gone ! great experience amazon	1
my wife bought this lipstick spain , happy find she could purchase it u.s. also . it perfect color her , doesn't smudge	1

rock star soap appeals my playful side scent this soap leaves one little giddy . sweet vanilla fragrance blended perfumes result something like spicy vanilla strawberry milkshake . i say yum ? this absolutely delish i think they may added little cinnamon mix . i love keeping lush soaps sink because they don't seem dry out my hands much gel soaps . this one perfect combination smitten hand cream . rock star soap left me dreaming buying other " vanilla " themed items like think pink ( which i tried ) , creamy candy ( bubble bar ) , sympathy skin ( which i'm dying try ) honey trap ( which i just tossed recklessly into my shopping cart ) . candy fluff sounds like it would go well this experience . if you love this soaps creamy consistency , gratuitous violets , sultana soap alkmaar impress . any chance vanilla toothpaste listed here soon ? wish , wish ... ~ rebecca review	1
almost immediately after using this face mask redness my face gone . it helps number or skin problems , i sensitive skin so it hard find product won't hurt me . most facial masks cause minor chemical burn , this left my face beautifully soft . if you're unsure this product , or wavering all , let me tell you you should buy it , it amazing .	1
perfume very subtle little hint sweetness . it not overpowering or musky . don't try sniff bottle or sample ... it won't it justice . you try it your skin know how great it smells . i've other designer frangrances , but this far my favorite i've received lot compliments	1
i using this product year . i love it . it rich non greasy formula gives my skin healthy glow . i use it alone under daily makeup . great mature skin	1
i very sensitive skin , thick beard , must shave daily . what hellacious combination ! art shaving sensitive skin best shaving cream i found ... i searching far wide . rest their products ... eh , i could take them or leave them ... i.e. there similar products you acquire much cheaper . this shaving cream particular no alcohol all kinds natural ingredients including bunch non-comudegenic ( sp ? ) oils really protect your skin .	1
this pur minerals starter kit great introduction this brand . i am absolutely love 4-in-1 pressed mineral makeup ( included kit ) . it so much better than bare escentuals makeup , which i using years . 4-in-1 provides great coverage , it foundation , concealer , spf 15 pressed powder all one . bare escentuals , i buy mineral veil , foundation concealer all separately , i still felt like my dark circles blemishes not covered well . pur minerals wonderful makeup , very lightweight , even brush soft my skin ! i highly recommend it	1
this smells so wonderful ! wear it you get compliments . it seems like it might summertime-only scent ( i.e. very tropical ) , but i'd wear it year round . i only wish they made larger size oil ..	1
wow ! my husband i both use this scrub . it very refreshing . salt scrub easy apply leaves nice minty smell shower skin least hour ! like previous review i feel chill after getting out shower ... then i full energy ! i look forward trying this one after hot work out or yard work ! this staple our household !	1
now let get its effectiveness out way so we talk love it or hate it scent ! it really thick conditioner works great every other day or every few days . i really long hair this tames it smoothes my split ends , it leaves my hair shiny . it isn't greasy all . if you used drugstore or salon conditioners , don't judge effectiveness any natural conditioner month . how long it take silicones mainstream conditioners leave your hair ( silicones all those things conditioner end " cone " , like dimethicone , etc ) . detoxing your hair off silicones well worth it though , my hair much healthier shinier without buildup . so scent : it green , kind melon fresh , hint violet ( like bathos , gratuitous violets , daddyo ) it . it took some getting used , when i first got it i thought it smelled green beans or some vegetable-like smell . but when you use it rinse it out , you left rich green scent , tiniest hint gently floral violet . it isn't everybody , but if you buy it , give it chance work its magic your hair before you make your judgement , because lovely violetty smell combined how well it works makes it kind addictive . i use it daddyo shampoo enhance hint violet fresh green scent i get it . i use it rotation american cream which bit lighter	1

i don't excessively oily skin , but i've never able wear mascara without smudging . waterproof , smudgeproof , expensive , drugstore , you name it i've tried it . every single one left dark shadows under my eyes within 2 or 3 hours . i'd given up mascara completely , but thought i'd try one more time this ( money back guarantee spalook , what risk ? )this mascara lives up it name smudge-proof . even wearing sunscreen my under-eye area , it doesn't transfer . even 100+ deg phoenix heat , it stays . i * love * it this reason . it also comes off easily night ; no problems there . however , i'm giving it only 4 stars because it flake little throughout day . not lot , not enough make me stop using it ( first truly smudge-proof mascara i've found ) , but it there . since it advertised smudge flake-proof , i can't give it full 5 stars	1

i bought this after using other murad products loving them . i like this , but i wouldn't say i love it . first , it bit overpriced . i get comparable drugstore product fraction price . toner itself decent , but doesn't seem clean deeply other toners . however , those who find toners bit harsh , this may good option . non-drying doesn't toner " burn " . overall , decent product , but not one i am sure i would re-purchase	1

chisel brush works well all-over . actually , it better than - it swept over everything my skin without depositing powder unevenly . that rare brush . usually you spend some time sponge or fingertips blending , but not this . light cream powder , named 4-in-1 foundation , provides excellent coverage without thick . ( thick powder base terrible - it always looks like you dunked your face bowl flour ! ) my freckles still there , but my skintone more even . this stuff concealer , foundation , powder , spf protection . awesome . so much easier than doing everything separately ! no oil , talc , alcohol , fragrance , chemical dyes , or preservatives , but what it vitamin shea butter . universal marble powder spreads into tint looks fairly natural - sun-kissed perhaps . it need darkening darker powder - least me . but only touch . mineral glow didn't go dark it looked either . i actually kind surprised this one - most dark powders end up everywhere if you try shade them out ... or impressively dark one location if you don't . this wasn't like all , though i think i'd like darker color eyeshadow accents . some mascara ... eyeliner ... .. .. .	1
