essentially one-season , lightweight , hibachi doesn't stand up extended use . so , $12 it too expensive but may worth $5	-1
i utterly guarantee this thing won't work . i employed pest control industry 16 years . we used find cockroaches living such devices all time ( it usually nice toasty warm there ) . sanitation , exclusion , very careful application pesticides what you need . rodents sometimes repelled brief time , but quickly adapt ( adapting environmental conditions one things rats best ) . again , count sanitation , exclusion , traps ; try avoid baits because you'd rather know where little s.o.b. died ( i.e. trap , rather than wall somewhere )	-1
i like everything thermometer except its most important feature : outside temperature too strongly influenced inside temperature . ok , so i it installed my place mountains where difference night inside/outside termperatures forty degrees or more . many mornings i check this thermometer two other outside thermometers find other two may read , example , 15 degrees this one read 35 degrees . it 60 degrees inside . my window double-paned , but still not insulate sufficiently produce unreliable outside readings . when not window-mounted placed other thermometers , readings acceptable consistent	1
clock works well , but really too small , projection only works well dimly lit locations . it also some optimal distance wall actually see numbers . it not focus feature if you wanted put it close wall	1

update my review due july 2006 heat wave : i two these low-cost alarms set up , both become quite intermittent when temperature reaches 90 degrees above ( shade ): sometimes they go off when person/car goes past , sometimes they not . soon temperature decreases though , they become much more reliable . i would not recomended these devices sections country hot weather , such arizona , texas , new mexico , etc . original review : i am very impressed this alarm : it accurately able detect people coming up stairs my apartment , sets off indoor alarm -- it not sent out any false alarms ( most problems this alarm ( i read reviews below ) appear caused sensor direct sun light . this seems cause these units numerous difficulties , should addressed patrol sensor enclosed instructions -- but isn't . however , simply shielding outdoor sensor all * direct * contact light sun using tape or opaque plastic , or repositioning outdoor sensor , appears eliminate false alarms or no alarms ) . this alarm unit appears quite well made , price , course , incredibly low . great buy !!	1

good : simple easy put together . works perfect you would expect . cleaning easy using brass brush occasionally . this little grill powerhouse , cooking most items less than 5 minutes . webber world class customer service . bad : grill works perfect right out box ( put it together yourself ) however , this where problem lies ... box . whoever webber got their packaging really screwed up . they put legs outside main grill container , result , legs came smashed plastic holds small parts stapled once allowing most parts slip through out box . my grill came smashed , dented , missing parts . i ordered replacement directly webber which they sent me entire grill no charge without needing send smashed one back . it also came smashed . instead calling again , i used parts both grills make one not smashed up .	1
just got this grill yesterday competitors website . i got super lucky they it priced same e-210 mistake . so i able purchase it 299.99 they offered free shipping ! low behold they honored price . they change price back 399.99 next day ... anyhow it came huge box , thank god deliver man nice enough bring it my condo . instructions say 30 minutes put together average consumer , but i would say least 45 minutes 1 hour . plus you need second person 1 step . after assembling we fired it up instant ultra hot heat !! this thing gets burning hot fast . we some shortribs salmon . they both stick pretty good grates which annoying , but i assume since it new it take few times cooking before stickiness goes away . plus only reason why i " forced " into gas grill because my condo association not allow me use my weber charcoal performer(great grill ) way !! i am now actually happy they force me lose charcoal because this grill definitely outweighs charcoal convenience hands down . i used occasionally burn food my performer .... but i don't see ever happening this although i got screaming deal , i would recommend this over e-210 simply because 3 burners must rotisserie indirect cooking !!! i can't wait buy rotisserie unit , summer sweet !	1
