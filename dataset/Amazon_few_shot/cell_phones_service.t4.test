i recently purchased this bluetooth scala-500 used it all maybe 5 times . why such short amount time ? because sound quality heard other end so poor i am told it sounds like i am windy tunnel when fact i am car windows up radio off . it bit too hot drive air condition off windows up just so person other end hear me . now i keep this piece junk my console only use it if my logitech bluetooth out power . if you buy this make sure you plan use it place like library where there no sounds all interfere . only good thing this headset it easy setup connects well my cell phone . think twice buying this product or check it out your local retailer first . even rebate i only paid $[ ... ] , but still not bargain . one star ease setting up my cell phone	-1
samsung great phone black jack . unfortunately , headset jack not standard jack , but instead one unique samsung phones . therefore , you forced buy samsung headset . bottom line -- don't bother . design horrible . earbuds don't stay ear . what makes matters worse each ear bud rigid teardrop inch half connects cord . any pressure or movement teardrop say clothing or hair pushes ear bud out your ear . i hope samsung creates adapter fit jack allow you use regular headphones .	-1

i it since october it clearly best phone i ever owned . it also replaced my camera , i am now never without camera . i attend lot concerts where cameras almost always prohibited . they don't give phone second glance , not realizing it got 3.2 megapixel capability . i got tons fantastic shots last 4 shows . after throwing 1gb memory stick ( i think it $79 ? ) it now storing half gig my best music display says it hold 300+ pics right now . movie function rocks too , however you going want up very close subject . sound playback movies fantastic though , so least concert videos make good listening . phone works flawlessly my pc . if i throw it usb cable , it pops up instantly drive , just like camera . just drag on/off music pics . all pics very nicely numbered named . if i don't care viewing files just want move stuff off phone , i don't even take it out my pocket . bluetooth connection allows me use their software move things around . also very cool it pops up my computer modem , which i actually able use immediately my pc anywhere program . terms phone , yeah it great . contact list easy work , call clarity no issue all , good signal , no dropped calls , etc . etc . ( this all cingular ) . speaker phone works well . it needs charging every 3rd day , charges very quickly . charges slower but usb plugged it also charges . only thing i think complain when using usb cable charge , it only wants charge it 89% . if i want 100% i throw it real charger few minutes .	1
overall i'm happy skin . it fits treo 700 very closely . this custom formed every curve , bump , button treo . my one complaint they advertise it compatible 700w 700p . i should paid more attention pictures thought it . 700w , if you don't know , almost identical except buttons just below screen . button layout same , but they different icons purposes . well , skin images button covers 700w , not 700p . not huge deal , just slight annoyance . i'm going see if there way remove these somehow	1
