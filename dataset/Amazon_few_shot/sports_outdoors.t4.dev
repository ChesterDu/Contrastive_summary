first i very happy this stroller . i love big wheels , front one which swivels . cup holders convenient both parent baby . adjustable handle awesome because i'm short i push stroller comfortable height . also it maneuvers very easily up down curbs , steers easily even one hand everywhere mall , museum , park , or city streets . one biggest drawbacks me reclining seat back . there drawstring you must adjust . this requires two hands difficult times if child fussy or uncooperative . despite this , i still loved stroller until recently . however , after only two months use , my stroller not lock . it actually folded up my son while pushing it . i now cannot even seem lock it into open position use . i not found any levers snap place hold it open . because stroller folds outward , not inwards like umbrella stroller , it actually pulls childs body backwards when locks give out . this very dangerous . i am contacting manufacturer this defect	-1

i've always loved victorinox swiss army knives , but i must admit i when i purchased this one , i not sure if i made right choice , but my expectations soon exceeded . it right before trip boundary waters canoe area wilderness minnesota , i lost my other swiss army knife ( tinker ) , i looking versatile knife locking blade . i not need dozens other tools my pending stay wilderness . i settled this one because it sale , i not disappointed . handle mild contour made it very comfortable handle . its size , it just right heft , but it not too heavy weigh down my shirt ( where i kept it my buttoned breast pocket ) . 4 " locking blade worked wonderfully . i could close it either one or two hands . when closing it , blade pauses halfway point , reducing risk closing it your fingers when closing it one-handed ( said , it not eliminate all risk , so close knife one hand your own risk ) . during my recent canoe trip , i lost my fillet knife portage trail surprised cleaning 24 " northern pike this blade quite painless ( though it take some skill ) . beyond blade , i've always found leather awl screwdriver handy , but opener blade primary reason why i prefer victorinox swiss army knives over those produced wegner . knife shipped simple cardboard box . sheath or pouch would nice , but i able fabricate one duct tape before my trip . since i kept it my shirt pocket most my trip , sheath wasn't necessary , but it one accessory you should consider purchasing if you choose this knife . i recommend getting one . you not disappointed	1

experienced cyclist who relocated manhattan summer `04 , i wanted purchase most theft resistant chain available . my ambition use my trek 3900 both exercise transportation , while not constantly worry it it stolen . experienced several bicycle bicycle part thefts boston chicago , i decided thoroughly research bicycle chains locks . stories vulnerability u-locks clearly stated kryptonite null-and-void-in-new-york warranty steered me towards hex chain made onguard . previous owner kryptonite master u-locks , i initially wanted stick tested brand . however , lessening appeal kryptonite locks widely publicized story 2004 explaining how design flaw certain models allowed them compromised bic pen (!) , causing recall . chicago , i frame destroyed when one thief attempted break master u-lock long pipe . while this failed attempt slightly bent u-lock , it collapsed main tube bicycle . hence , i thought using chain manufactured slightly lesser-known brand without publicized vulnerabilities would good idea -- much like purchasing mac would protect against windows viruses . after one year use , i very happy 12mm beast chain . 9.5 pounds , this chain upper limit what one affix bicycle still able ride it . my case , i am able rap it around seat post enough clearance my legs . typical bicycle , chain adds 40% overall weight . when i purchased this lock , i unaware 14mm , 15 pound version existed . even so , i would not purchased this model , which more appropriate motorcycle or piece construction equipment . design beast chain exemplary . addition very long , thin keys complementary keyhole , there sliding keyhole cover , making mechanism very corrosion pick resistant . thick polyethylene coating may serve similar purpose while preventing freezing , which used savvy thieves make lock more brittle . record , i used commonly available electronics freezing spray embrittle earlier-generation kryptonite lock when i lost key . five hits over-sized hammer , protruding barrel lock supporting metal cracked right off . pretty scary . while no chain eliminate possibility bicycle theft , i still my trek . it impossible tell what tactics thieves employ next . it seems unlikely conventional pair bolt cutters could cut this chain . when i emailed onguard customer service , they no straight answer its cut resistance . my impression only oxyacetylene torch or hydraulic cutter could break links . both techniques would attract great deal attention . hence , secured beast chain , your bicycle safe one get public area .	1

purchased christmas present 12 y.o. daughter . two positive things first all : we little late ordering , so scheduled ship after xmas , but actually arrived 5 days before ; also price excellent amazon -- local stores selling exact same product twice price -- free shipping . assembly : i read other reviews little apprehensive , but i also checked owners manual online ( always good idea ) check out step-by-step before i purchased , it seemed doable . it definitely challenge effort , but not horrible . instructions say you need 2 people , but it definitely helps more -- often one person needed just sort through parts while other two hold assembly . we 3 adults 12 year old everyone kept busy . biggest problem there lot steps , but you can't intuitively figure out where directions leading you until you get end--it lot like doing your taxes . one very important recommendation : parts come numbered bags -- numbers correspond steps assembly--don't take pieces out bag until you need them . confusing aspect : one bag parts might used 3 or 4 different steps some bolts nuts look very similar so you check , double check , triple check before using them . one step , size bolt needed not match size-matching template printed instructions . it took us 4 hours put it together -- this definitely process you not want rush through . once put together , it nice product . those looking purchase something like this , i would definitely not get anything smaller 50-inch backboard -- it not big . it sturdy portable , height adjustment works fine . we filled it sand , which performs better , but which we probably regret when day comes take it apart we figure out what 350 lbs sand . however , this out cold weather so water out question . i ultimately purchased this model because it seemed like value performance made it worth rigors installation . i knew what we getting into when we ordered it , it worked out exactly i anticipated . so , get some friends , patient , measure-twice/bolt once , make sure you someone analytical mind managing parts , few hours , you nice hoop .	1

i rather lost my love swimming since i cannot see well without wearing contacts , chlorine irritates me twice bad while wearing them . i used several different brands goggles my contacts over years overjoyed when i ran across these . i debated brand i am familiar but reading reviews , i admit i wasnt really liking them many reasons mentioned product , so , i took chance . you cannot go wrong money these , they fit comfortably , could substitute my regular glasses pinch , after small amount adjusting they very leak proof wide field vision . strap adjustment bit tedious manipulate , but definate good thing , once you them ' dialed ' there no chance they slip or move out adjustment it uses very clever locking mechanism lock straps place , rather than double strap through buckle design seems all prevelant . my eyes available powers offered so , i went closest step down my prescription , figuring additional distortion water would even things out , but , i see quite clearly them both out water . if you need some vision correction , don't like fiddeling contacts pool i not , you simply must own these goggles	1

i this trailer 5 days used it 5 days row . 3 days jogger stroller 2 days bike trailer . * it easy set up take down . yes it take little time but i am getting good it . i don't feel like you need " strong " either . * we live apartment carry this item our back patio through our apartment front so compact light issue me since i one mostly using it . i am glad we went aluminum , it light . it fold down nicely even wheels i still get it through apartment without hitting furniture . pros : * bike trailer it pulls smoothly . * easy put my mountain bike . * i feel it made well safe . * my 2 � yr old seems comfortable it loves pockets her treats/drinks . there even compartment my backpack . * it simple transition into jogging stroller . * stroller it light easy push until .... cons : * it seems there not enough weight up front so front wheel wobbles uncontrollably which makes it impossible push . i lift it then set it down again get it go straight . i end up jogging front wheel held up , which not fun . however , i guess i could buy jogger stroller really meant jogging but they shouldn't promote it stroller if you can't push it . i am going contact company see if there way fix this problem . * 5-point harness no different other trailers i seen . they seem flimsy little stiff attach ring . * today i got home ride realized flag missing . i am guessing it flew off when i going down hill . * i hope canvas holds up . there already two very small holes where flag inserted rubs . * rubber clasps stroller handle already coming off . all all i am happy product price . just few concerns mentioned above . i am not hard-core rider but intend use product frequently so i hope it holds up . it seems sturdy well made but time tell .	1

great stage when baby can't really " play " toys . because tubing easy grab hold , my seven week old baby easily grab shake it around . if i put this just within reach , when she moves her arms around she grab it involuntarily . i make sure this our blanket every play time .	1
if you bamboo floors i highly recommend this stuff . it erase all tiny scratches seem accumulate so easily these floors . it works pretty well masking deeper gouges , but it isn't perfect . someone looking still able spot gouge , but it usually good enough get your security deposit back . yes , price shipping more than price product , but it not like every hardware store carries this stuff . i checked my area , no one carried it , so i ordered it online . even shipping costs , it still worth it	1
