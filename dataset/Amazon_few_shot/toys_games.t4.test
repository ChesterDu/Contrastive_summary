my one year old i love these blocks . they light , soft provide endless opportunity imagination . however , they extremely expensive inferior quality construction . when we opened box , we found several blocks not cut straight edge making them difficult stack . also , several identical shape blocks not exactly same size leading stacking problems . one blocks peeling one corner . these blocks such great idea i find it hard believe no other companies making them	-1

i feeling this toy would trouble when i saw delivery guy walking up our front steps weird grin his face . evidently , box vrooming , vibrating shrieking throughout his rounds , he only too glad end his term its temporary steward . my two-year-old largely lost interest this toy ; he doesn't mind shaking noise , but more often than not it just vrooms then doesn't go anywhere . my advice : buy matchbox , or hot wheels ... or something more reliable volume control . this probably our next load donations ... thrift shoppers beware .	-1

i picked this item up my 6 year old nephew who loves science . we put it together one night i surprised find base volcano incredibly thin plastic crack under any pressure all . plaster/sand mixture impossible work , it just balled up into clumps there no real way spreading it around smoothly . we both ended up plaster all over us . once it dried , he excited get paint it . soon he began paint , parts plaster started breaking off chunks . hooking plastic tubing up not major problem but i issues keeping it hooked together . " pump " system supposed send vinegar into baking soda chamber push up into volcano . instead " pump " ( which squeeze bottle ) pushed vinegar weakly upwards then once it hit baking soda chamber it clogged up . when it finally made its way out through volcano after me squeezing bottle hard possible , it barely trickled out . once it trickled enough , rest plaster fell off it got wet . he his sisters just looked me asked " it ? " after three tries we trashed whole thing . also , " rock samples " they give you kit size tip your fingernail . i'm geologist these not rare , expensive rocks . there no reason not include larger samples . he very disappointed whole thing so i . i can't believe smithsonian put their name this product . we'll go back our plaster volcano vinegar baking soda	-1
sure wish my mother-in-law read these reviews before giving this me christmas . tried play it once my parents , who also big 24 fans , few nights later sorely disappointed . this game obviously just shoved out door feed off popularity 24 show not garner any popularity its own right . mini-games exercise extreme frustration . problem dvd not ideal those mini-games . whenever you try move there only two subsequent animations : successful one unsuccessful one , which made it seem like it just moving random . other than it seemed like game going pretty linear , clue cards contained no useful information , board completely superfluous , unless apparently you masochistic enough get bonus level	-1

this game set it amazing quality . every piece so much detail it just looks good without doing anything ! dubloons best part , like others said , make best clinking sound when you drop pile into your hand . this game definately worth buying .... if you come up some new rules make game more interesting . gameplay very uninteresting , boring , brainless . my wife never passes up opportunity tell me how boring it , even her younger ( 12 year old ) sister thought it boring more fun playing pieces . my wife says i should bought us settlers catan instead spending my money this ( before we got our own set ... now we one ) , but when i bought it i knew it would just game pieces . i am brewing up some good rules change gameplay dramatically make it much more interesting . she likes settlers so much .. maybe i get some trade spices into game whatnot . anyways , if you creative good idea ship game , then definately get this game set . it high quality beautiful . but , if you don't interest make your own game , then pass this one up because you would most likely love play any other game you own before this	1

we this sandbox five years . it durable my two kids ages 3 5 just love it . color plastic still bright under sun years . sometimes water seeps when it rains but this makes sand play even funner kids . we tend put rock top lid keep it place though it cover box perfectly . it also nice lid attached box itself easy kids remove put back when . kids usually sit outside it though it accomodate 1-2 small kids inside it well . i find most kids dont want get sand all over end up sitting outside it regardless . overall good investment kids love it	1

build figure ( baf ) program marvel legends keeps rocking . this time build giant 14 " apocalypse . this baf big cool , super articulated , sculpt paint fine enough sculpture . apocalypse 5 stars . iron fist ... well he super articulated come mighty booty ( that buttocks ) apocalypse , but really weakest figure this series . lot just charater design though . green tights open v-neck green shirt , what tattoo supposed anyway , ballet slippers dew-rag ? pretty horrible looking . if you , try find red suit variant , least that little cool . also , accesories ( besides booty ) two rubbery flames fit into his hands give fire fist effect . good luck . they kind flimsy hard place hands . once you get them you better not touch figure again or they fall off . overall , not quatlity figure or accesories i'd expect . but rest figures series make up this one , plus you still get booty	1
i bought this toy my 3 year old son before his baby brother born . he absolutely loves this doll ! i babysit during day he took care his baby right me while i cared baby i keep . he regressed started wetting his pants again when i began babysitting but now going bathroom his own again after getting this doll his own baby care ! yawn some other reviewers said sound bit weird but it only doll ! if baby not attended properly make her stop fussing or put her sleep then she'll eventually just it her own so it not frustrating my son , great younger kids . my husband not want our son " girl " doll i can't find any clothes fit doll turn it into boy so my only wish this doll also made boy or least boy clothes sold her .	1

if you your friends just too crazy conventional board games , give i've never - game truth try . object game simple , players move around board answering highly personal potentially defamatory questions , take shots or drink beer while playing . questions formatted " i've never .... " ( example , " i've never skinny-dipping " ) . if this true you , you get move forward designated number spaces . if it false , you pay consequence ( generally you must take drink ) . some spaces game board automatically force you drink . many people find questions far too offensive overly personal , uncomfortable playing this game . if this you , don't feel bad , you're not only one . however , group close friends , this game total laugh riot . this game perfect bachelor or bachelorette party , or just regular party group friends who crazy you	1

okay , original b-wing little under-scaled wasn't very accurate movie . lego gained alot popularity over years , alot more than before . alot people asking new b-wing because : 1 . they weren't fans time get it . 2 . b-wing just so cool . here my review : b-wing , well , just looks so nice ! i don't know why it called b-wing , since it resembles more than anything else . oh well , still cool ship . you get two minifigures , b-wing pilot dressed nice looking red . you get sullustan pilot named ten numb . ( yes ten numb real star wars character , he dressed red return jedi . ) i think ten numb looks great . if you see his actual picture , i think you would agree . b-wing pilot classic smily face what looks racing helmet . shweet ! two pilots you only need one . b-wing masterpiece . not only it look more accurate than it previous self , it more accurate . b-wing itself very sturdy . two cons come b-wing though . one them missiles shown not fire properly . you must tilt b-wing so , which very annoying . those dreaded stickers . you never really get them right . oh well , i don't even put stickers anyway . b-wing comes nice yellow black service station tools so you display b-wing . i don't use it because reality , b-wing lands horizontally . but it still nice used other sets if you like . all all , this b-wing literally destroys old . you get two pilots when you only need one . price isn't bad considering pieces . i think every fan should own least one these . i'm still trying figure out shape though ..	1

box said it came 10 refillable paint containers , but ours only 9 bottles , one those empty . no matter , really , it just small amount paint start , but why not give people what you tell them you ? color selection all right , but not super - you don't get roygbiv or anything . it may vary , course , but we lot light green . some them glitter , which extra cool good job making whole picture sparkle if you add it last . it also comes small assortment ( 40 pieces ) paper -- both large small sizes -- which you encouraged reserve last one template trace make new ones . poster board seems same thickness original paper . smaller " bonus " machine go fast if you pump button down repeatedly . doing this , it actually go faster than battery operated one paint distributes spatters very well . instruction manual , if you call it , pretty limited . it shows 3 pictures how put everything together operate it . no tips or hints how make neat designs . it least detailed set instructions i seen art toy . it comes apart easy rinsing/wiping . i've always this immediately after paint session , units still clean they first time out box . my kids love it . they want spin pictures every day	1

first , let me say , this first rc plane any type i ever flown . after thouroghly reading instructions last night , this afternoon i took supes his maiden voyage . i some crashes , but after 10 - 20 minutes trial error , i started getting some decent flights . i admit i skeptical first , but this thing actualy fly ! it tendency veer right , but once i got hang it i able fairly easily compensate it steering other direction ( i not tried using included weights balance it yet ) . keys successful flight : 1 ) needs large open area : example , we used soccer field 2)wind must relatively calm 3)follow instructions proper release/launch . when you're flying you'll probably want keep it over soft grassy area , supes earned few battle scars landing road ( nothing major though ) . i must say , my son i blast watching him fly ! note : it may little too difficult younger kids fly themselves .	1

i can't say enough these toys ! they so nicely made feel great your hands . small enough carry around big enough little hands . great quality , sturdy superior look . collectors buying these up like hot cakes ebay living proof people willing shell out cash these . especially ones harder find . people written reviews these no stores carry them . they sold out because there rush these toys even before movie release . hopefully time goes if they keep producing them they easier come . that what i am hoping . i don't all characters yet would like least one each my son , maybe even more collecting . good luck your search !	1
i bought this jeep my 3 year old daughter birthday . we seeing same problem reviewer - she not heavy enough weigh it down wheels spin even small hills . also , it seems jerk her when she first hits " gas " pedal . however , when her 3 year old cousin jeep her - ( totaling 60-63 lbs . ) it seems ride lot better . i suppose weighing it down something until she gets bigger would help . battery problem - ours fine so far . she ridden her jeep maybe two hours total so far , i not recharged battery yet . maybe first reviewer one defective or something . all all , this toy may little old three year old ( least mine ) , but i think she grow into it . i update battery soon	1

this handheld dond game isn't totally bad $15 it cost . here my review , i hope get user pic up online my unit too . pros - i like off button top , alot these handheld games just don't one , so its nice feature . you option turning game sound or off , even during game , there no volume control , but " duct tape " fix everything , you could always cut small piece duct tape place it over speaker if you wanted sound , but didnt want it loud ! or other methods just covering speaker w/a napkin or something .. game quite addictive you always seem want play , " just one more " game before finally determining there other things life ! ( nbc dond game you play online much quicker visually better)cons : i really dont like numbers so small , it makes it very hard see if you don't light right angle . it would nice if backlight , would make those late night games alot easier ! i wish there screen contrast adjustment , especially bottom , case numbers select 3 or 4 rows , font size maybe 5 or less just very small , they all start off black numbers when you arrow select one , case you land flashes black light grey , once you select case it turns light grey show you already selected one . it would really help if they ever make newer version this game , it wouldn't bad if game itself little bigger enable visually friendly screen . ------------------------------------------------------------ ah , its not big deal there really no vocal sounds , music kinda cheesy , but all all its fun game $ 15 . it fun , all game chance really , hey my 3rd time playing it , i actually picked 1,000,000 case ! got million , no bells or whistles happened after , scrolling marquee top , which where it gives you instructions deal offers say something like " sweet ! " i stop middle game something once game waiting me select cases it said marquee " let go already .. " guess it impatient!wouldn't hurt buy this game , $ 15 won't really break bank it fun pastime .	1
it seems like every christmas there one toy top list major bust , this year it love licks puppy !!! this only thing my 5 year old daughter really wanted , she so disappointed we can't get it anything than bark ( or whine it really sounds) ! she sad feeling like it her fault , like she not ' loving it enough ' . i thought maybe we just gotten one lemon , but it looks like they all like this . i can't believe manufacturer would put this out set up so many kids disappointment . major disappointment !! don't waste your money or set your kids up extremely disappointed	-1
this item ok . . . maybe it just me , but we some issues it . it ok first ( age 1 ) , because my son couldn't reach pedals , his feet just kind dangled . but he got little older , he always seemed loss what his feet . ( there nowhere rest them . ) he would try rest them pedals , inevitably jam them his foot . now he reach pedals ( age 2 ) , but hasn't mastered them yet . but his feet dragging ground . i guess i raise seat up , but this still won't solve his dangling problem . secondly , canopy cup holder useless , our bike doesn't steer particularly straight , even though we tried correct this . my sister son same age mine , she same problems . it very cute , we always get compliments it , but not nearly functional . wish i gotten something else	-1
this game amazingly addictive . it whole-family christmas gift hit season . everybody took turn most us spent many hours it over week . it provides lot fun not only rider , but all others who watch cheer . 4-year-olds grandparents , all blas t.t he game pretty simple , hard part learning how work controller pull off tricks . its one those things that easy get started , but hard master . there number courses three characters keep things interesting . we mostly half-pipe which seemed most fun . this thing built , they say , like tank . you use your back foot control turns you lean forward/backward control your speed . weight rating something like 240 or 280 -- we number grown-ups pounded it , one particular jumped board like maniac . it really impressive it didn't just crumble bits under punishment . ( you imagine enteretainment provides . ) this great game groups gather round some fun . its also whole lot more active than your typical console or pc game . you certainly work up sweat playing . get this game , get give it chance . it takes while learn how control board , but you it , once you , you really get hooked	1

i just bought two these my kids [ ... ] ( boy ) ( girl ) . i expecting guns would relatively low quality would not overall great toy , but i wanted encourage my kids get outside run around . i figured i'd give lazer tag try . i very surprised find they really work . i mean they really accurate very good , solidly built toys . there variety games you program into gun which keeps things bit different each time ( nice ! ) . my daughter doesn't play too much anymore though , but she never really into gun thing anyway . not problem . my son still loves play me we run around shoot it up great time together . rocket really works great also . it launches very far shoots out infrared ( or whatever ) shots all directions impact . very neat effect . my only concerns rocket it made nerf-type material break/tear if not taken care . we just lost one ( actually , i think my wife lost it , not really kids ) . we also bought two individual " taggers " ( guns ) they add even more fun . we teams play it adds few new games mix including our favorite , " own zone " , where one handguns " zone generator " it emits zone infrared which you try move into stay there score points . very hard , lots running game . batteries seems last long time . we played several hours one day single charge no problem . then kids played over several days shorter bursts still same batteries . i would estimate least few days play per set batteries . we bought rechargables all them too--it'll same money long run . i think all guns quite durable , made seemingly sturdy plastic . i think kids could rough them up they'd still ok . i've read other reviews people dropping them concrete still fine . one day , though , my son pumping up gun preparation shoot rocket ( built air pump-thing ) but so he stuck muzzle gun dirt . this got mud/dirt all over dual lazer lenses front gun then he couldn't hit me 10 minutes until we realized it cleaned them off . no permanent damage though . ideally , i think best ages these guns 10+ , but coordinated slightly younger kids could ok also . it essential kids other people play though you need enough guns go around everyone . still , we got 4 guns rechargable batteries under $100.00 . not bad really . oh , i've read some people complaining difficulty programming game modes guns . yes , it takes 20-30 minutes become proficient really should initially handled adult , but now we fly through it no problem . kids probably wouldn't able figure it out themselves ( little kids i mean ) . overall , i recommend lazer tag brand guns . very good so far we expect only more fun come now spring here . even my wife out playing us last time !!! go buy them -- you won't disappointed . ps : i only gave them 3 educational value because it really more running sport type toy . sure , you learn teamwork strategy , but it not chess you know . you get point	1
this excellent game play group friends . its fun rules simple easy follow .	1
my daughter loves this swing . we bought it ot put variety climber swing set extension . she'd love swing all afternoon if she could . i agree other reviewers , swing tend swing diagnol , but it happens when child seat isn't centered seat if they leaning one side or other . you only small adjustments swing because it only comes rope . no extra chain etc . really fix diagnol swing , but you barely tell it swings way . it not taken away fun value grace doesn't seem care one bit . it safe buckle easy get out once you it couple times . i would buy this swing again , diagnol swinging all .	1

harr , maytee ! who doesn't love pirates ? great ocean-faring vessels crewed adventurous swashbucklers , braving seas each other search buried treasure . it endearing theme . when i discovered mega bloks producing pirate line , i excited . this definitely something look forward , given mega bloks usual quality attention detail , their seafaring vessels crews would no doubt absolutely fabulous . well , wait over , pyrates subjected my scrutiny , my feelings mixed . good news first . check out these minifigs !!! this set comes three sea marauders one skeletal pirate , -- wow , check out articulation these guys ! we've got ball joints shoulders hips super posability ! legs bend knees , arms bend elbows . head ball joint well . these best minifigs i've ever seen . you pose these guys pretty much any way you want . but wait , there more ! detail paint jobs these guys fantastic . detailed outfits , pirate scowls , adventurous facial expressions , texture detail outfits , hats , faces . they're like mini action figures . i kid you not , these some truly magnificent minifigs . okay , i'm getting verklemft . talk amongst yourselves . i'll give you topic . captain cutlass stormstalker neither storm nor stalker . discuss ... okay , i'm better now . let move . accessories our swashbucklers include cutlasses , pistol , crossbow , treasure map , shovel , spyglass , couple lamps , couple barrels , obligatory treasure chest pieces eight . our pirates also accompanied rat snake , who hide out ship hold . now here where winds our sails abruptly change direction . pirate ship . it great . it detailed . it some nice features . but there almost no building going here . boat composed maybe four or five large pieces all easily snap together . aft cabin all one piece . this thing goes together five minutes . mega bloks produces " building toys " ( other words , " lego except not lego " ) . if this boat brought me courtesy , say , fisher price or playmobil , i'd expect see this sort design . when i buy mega bloks set , i am expecting some entertaining building . there nothing build here . only thing this boat makes it remotely lego-esque it pegs deck figures stand . i suppose upshot this nonexistent building set durability excellent . nothing gonna fall off during play . boat little wheels its underside so it roll flat surface . features include single mast four cloth sails . what little rigging there here already assembled us . that good thing . man , rigging playmobil pirate ship challenge . just loop string over few hooks your front sail good go . atop mast spacious crow nest plenty room multiple guys stand . stairs ascend deck top aft cabin , where our pirate captain man steering column . grated floors open up , offering us access ship hold . forward area , we device turn skeletal pirate into normal pirate . put mr. skeleton mr. pirate chamber turn chamber transformation . rounding out our boat accessories anchor , two spring-loaded cannons ( one which fires harpoon ) , what pirate set would complete without plank ? walk plank , ya scurvy dog ! mentioned , details fabulous . they've outdone themselves detail department . all said , my only complaint this pirate set there nothing build . spite this major flaw , this set gets resounding thumbs up me . i think mega bloks supplanted playmobil " best pirate set market "	1

uno excellent game any age 7 up ( according makers ; i've watched sharp 4 yr old enjoy playing only slightly modified rules ) . it easy learn but continues provide challenging play years . rules easily modified accomodate diffenent skill levels or time available . this one doesn't need bells whistles , it great it . although mattel would not encourage this ( or even suggest it ) playing points lends itself modest wagers , extent , allows handicaping players different skill levels . educational value not obvious , but significant . it teaches players think ahead , consider branches sequels actions , strategy . compact size ( like two standard poker decks ) allows this one travel well , played trains , planes , boats , buses , tents .	1

back when i student va tech , me my roomies used play this ( sega genesis nhl 95 ) all time ... well , maybe not all time . after graduation i aquired pc version , nhl hockey 95 , which i still , but unfortunately it doesn't play well xp ( haven't able get sound working , one thing .... yea , tried vds , etc , etc ) . my cousin i used play this one all time ... well , anyway . until this came out i hadn't played game 2-3 years , but contemplating buying old laptop use just this game so when i home holidays my cousin i could play once again . then this thing comes . we both like " cool !! " forget football , but hockey worth price alone . i almost completed season week i it ... very addicitive .... fun . only drawback they took out player names ... but all stats there . i don't remember everything original , but it seems they took out some other stuff too , like skill level ( rookie , pro , all-star ... maybe some other stuff ) . i think they just used all-star level this game , because its harder than i remember ... defense very tough . i really fight hard points . it just makes win all more fun ... loss all more devastating . anyway , i would recommend this anyone who fan old game ... or fan hockey . it doesn't all fancy graphics stuff ... but gameplay fun-factor there spades	1

i agree many other reviewers ... sole fact product " after market " or " not recommended manufacturer " certainly not diminish its worth my mind ! certainly this product could installed too tightly , but if you're going ask your " certified car seat installation expert " one thing typically wrong way nearly all car seats installed , they'll tell you most not installed tight enough ! our minivan leather seats predates latch systems , but our carseats new britax very heavy ... it not possible us get them installed without them sliding several inches , base , side side , unless we use mighty tite . it bulky , we rented minivan this summer made its use impossible ; your car seat , check out use this product ( should you choose use it ) your car seat before accepting rental vehicle or making new vehicle purchase . all this brouhaha over certification mightytite reminds me faa not " approving " baby b'air in-flight safety vest lap children airplanes ... it approved use years europe , but usa they'll tell me i cannot my child this vest during takeoff landing - this make my child safer held my arms ? i think not . use your noggin - if you need way secure your car seat so it not move around too much , this might good fit you	1

hats off fisher price designers ! roundhouse several neat features : 1 . it automatically disconnects all cars off train engines ( since there room only one engine turn table)2 . gates go up down automatically when turn table not aligned main track3 . turn table pauses each possible branches 5-10 seconds , which makes it easy little engineers line engine up next trackif you not familiar geomotion system : lever each building selects either let trains drive through , or stop trains use train motor ( based gear tooth bottom train ) drive some mechanical feature building . you gotta see it yourself ; it very clever system . my 3 yo loves it .	1
i got this game christmas . first time we played it , we found it hard hear what gatekeeper saying if we talking . you couldn't pause dvd or rewind it , so if we missed what he said , we out luck . it also kind stressful trying beat clock when we didn't know what we doing . second time we played it , it little bit easier because we understood game better . we found it impossible beat gatekeeper allotted amount time . next time we play , we going make blank spaces into spaces where you earn key , make it possible someone chance win .	1
