yes , tc oldest continually published magazine usa , it their 160th anniversary . however , i see little reason celebrate . why ? because i fail see how it really improved over years . nowadays , this magazine seems cater far too much material lusts " nouveau riche " . back day when it true " high society " magazine , there rather interesting educational articles arts , literature culture . it beautiful it really gave person something aspire , but now just like so much rest society mutated into lot pretentious materialist wannabees bragging " bling bling " , so this magazine . there far too many adverts so-called " luxury goods " my tastes , although they put patronizing article women over age 60 new " power " base , they insist using only thin 20-something models who probably can't afford clothes they modeling ! articles wise , they starting sound more like glamour or cosmo than erudite publication i used enjoy buying newsstands 20 years ago . yes , tc changed times ... but these not good times if case . it too bad	-1

wired magazine proven me something it never even occurred me imagine : there level cynical , style-whoring , inaccurate , myopic snarkiness goes beyond merely " trading substance style . " wired consistently behind curve these days , but doesn't stop publication spinning every article like golden truth you too lame know . articles controversial subjects , one side routinely saddled straw man arguments so blatant artless i find them offensive even when i disagree parties who set up fall . just often , features which don't discuss contentious topic still edge them , making fun person , group , or idea way isn't enlightening or even humorous , let alone warranted subject matter . generally , wired mean-spirited it self-congratulatory . this attitude appeals primarily demographic tech wonks it industry tourists professionally personally deflated bubble burst , desperately trying assert their relevance relive their high-flying , know-it-all glory . any content easily outweighed sheer volume half-truths , shoddy reasoning , straight-up falsehoods which could easily revealed corrected casual investigation subjects treated pages choked high gloss , yuppie/genxer-targeted corporate mind-poison ( advertising ) . isn't world technology interesting magical enough without mixing spin , double-talk , factual misrepresentation presidential debate impotent , absurd bravado battle bot pre-match trash talk ? people know little enough how tech rules world how it , quite plausibly , save it . this magazine could evangelize technology promise educate its current future potential . instead it concentrates one-shots written style passes " hip " forwards attitude rather than message , emphasis sensationalism over accuracy , more common advertising than edification	-1
cook illustrated first cooking magazine i'd found myself truly motivated read cover-to-cover , even though they insert advertisements their own products , which i suppose , them , makes this " ad-free " magazine , but i'm not surprised they've bent rules claim . one time i found it necessary contact cook illustrated customer service issue , i simply floored treatment i received ... i'll simply leave it . i personally don't intend re-subscribing ( " fine cooking " , here i come ! ) . you , however , may find this cooking magazine you . , far what they goes , cook illustrated good what they - i'll give them . if you not found this review helpful , i'm sorry if i haven't made value my warning apparent . just know there those us out there who bad experiences , simply trying prevent others experiencing same .	-1

i subscribed this magazine almost year now i become very skeptical much its advice . this advice seems heavily influenced its paying advertisers e.g. us dairy industry ( there always least one those annoying " got milk " ads ) not surprisingly , every issue there several articles magazine hype supposed benefits diet high dairy products ( e.g. milk cheese ) . however read many books nutrition , it become very clear me majority current research shows diet high dairy products actually very damaging your health - instance read china study colin campbell , extremely comprehensive nutritional study sheds great deal light us dairy industry its shady methods influencing public perception healthfulness its products . it well known there many better ways getting calcium etc into your diet than dairy but this magazine unfortunately blinded its advertisers ' paychecks . magazine also appears very similar prevention magazine which i also subscribed i would make same criticism . my advice stick reliable sources health like excellent " berkeley wellness letter " not supported or influenced advertisements drugs companies or powerful industry groups like us dairy industry	-1

i under impression this literary magazine would full fiction , short stories , essays , book reviews , literary criticism . instead i received magazine discusses political issues . magazine know what it wants ? they recently released special fiction issue newsstands . why would they if they're becoming political magazine ? they want news/political magazines such time , u.s. news world report , newsweek or they want literary magazine ? they're doing poor job establishing themselves drawing line what they want . i regret subscribing because i felt mislead . course atlantic staff , turning magazine into political direction probably bring them more sales . i don't think reading literary magazines dead any means but format needs revamped so people want read it .	-1
after falling love gourmet yellow cookbook , i subscribed gourmet , hoping same great classic recipes commonsense commentary . wow , what disappointment . i just received my second issue , reviewer said , it 90% ads high-end luxury goods like jewelry cars . 6-page " special advertisement section " stops so special when there 20 them one issue ! what happened , ruth reichl ? few recipes one find unattractive and/or too difficult even weekend cooking . those cooks looking great cooking magazine , i highly recommend bon appetit over gourmet : majority magazine recipes cooking tips , only interspersed ads . i calling see if i get my subscription switched tomorrow .	-1
this worst magazine i ever subscribed too . i hated it so much after first issue when new ones came , i thru it right trash . here why : 1- ad after ad dietary supplements ( like dexatrim stacker ) which i think cheapins creditablity magazine b/c true health doesnt come bottle . 2- many pics overly built up women ( think fitness competitions ) ... not something average women aspire too ... too me , nasty looking . 3-the information it general information anyone common sense already know ! my advice you , avoid this magazine , unless you like body building or like looking body builders	-1

since its fisrt issue 1994 , mojo magazine source all things rock roll . what i love most this magazine they ridiculously exaustive articles semi-obscure but important groups past present . where else would you read 19 page story making ogden nut gone flake , or cultural importance purple rain soundtrack ? writing this magazine so great they make synopsis son ringo starr musical career most interesting thing you've ever read . british music journalism market cutthroat it gets , only best publications survive . my biggest concern after more than 10 years such writing subject matter become shortage where they begin recycle articles past issues because they ran out bands write abou t.t hat say it not totally without flaw . british music magazines this awful habit putting together these ' best albums ever made ' lists every two years questionable entries . sorry , but calling kula shaker 27th best band all time 1997 just stupid . also , since this imported uk ( would it really but their balls us publishing outlet like majority magazines out there ? ) you not only pay hefty price it , it hit or miss you end up included cd comes it .	-1

obviously " ugly " comments below written uneducated uneducated guesses assumptions . i love this magazine . there awesome workouts , great meals great stories inspire one all . yes , it cover fitness/figure competitions , but it doesn't mean everyone look like or get their bodies level ... it magazine inspiration ... look physcially fit ( who only able look like when they compete , not 365 days year everyone knows unhealthy ... even those who compete ) . yes , downfall this magazine all supplement advertisements ... but what magazine without advertisements ? every magazine you look some form adverstisements since this technically " bible " fitness , there going advertisements tailored supplements . i admit , i somewhat offended reading what " ugly " say . they must've jealous , because i felt way towards fitness like they when i their shoes ( i weighed 180 one point my 4 ' 11 " frame ) , or upset because they didn't research this magazine just assumed it would girly magazine false info how lose those last 20 lbs doing useless no weights exercises or " seen tv " cardio dvds/exercise machines/gimmicks . those women not ugly all not bodybuilders ... most fitness competitors doing gymnastic type routines only lifting tone . weight lifting not body builder make . you would lift extreme , power lift pros take steroids ( hence ugly men-looking women ) . so ... if you want take your body next level ... better yet , actually lose some fat healthy manner need some inspiration , please buy copy this magazine . check it out . if you're into fitness/figure competitions , well , obviously this bible . :) uneducated below , i am competing my first figure competition 9 days . all things i learned through my trainers , most supplements you see ads not condoned them . contrary popular belief , we don't all consume protein shakes all day , nor this magazine say you reach your weight loss goals . substituting toast jam bagel cream cheese just bad , because you're substituting sugar fat . doesn't make any sense . i am one who overweight learned great deal magazines like this ... every magazine , whether it fitness , fashion , etc . must taken grain salt every now then , because not even so-called " experts ' agree what works what doesn't . everyone body different . look this magazine , research , make educated choice	-1

this might sound strange first , but i confess : course i subscribe gramophone its critically perceptive unfailingly well-written reviews features , but perhaps what i love best this magazine copious informative record-label advertisements ! just leafing through nov . or dec . 2004 edition , i see full-page even two-page spreads showing : * all lastest issues gramophone awards series -- series mid-priced reissues universal ( philips , decca , dg ) recordings won gramophone award . * all latest issues rosette collection , series mid-priced reissues universal recordings awarded rosette penguin guide . * all latest releases hyperion , dg , sony , rca , philips , emi , virgin , naxos , naive , classics pleasure , bis , chandos , cpo , mdg , etc . etc . etc . other words , if you're fairly assiduous collector trying stay abreast all latest recordings , you find gramophone invaluable indeed unsurpassed this respect -- both new releases reissues . ads not only give you catalog numbers release dates ; they also inform you which recordings won which awards garnered accolades which critics . browsing ads gramophone every month * * best way see all new releases -- not even most well-stocked classical-specialist cd shop would carry all these titles . what more , many many desirable classical cds * never * issued domestically north america , so how else you going find out what available europe ? furthermore , every issue contains 4- or 5-page section called " new releases , " which lists very specific product info every cd issued month over 100 record labels (!!) -- that no exaggeration because i actually counted them . new developments i've noticed since gramophone significant makeover nov 2004 issue : gone robert layton ( bbc music magazine ) , apparently traded jeremy nicholas ( bbc music magazine ) -- these new developments , aren't they ? so it no longer true say all three penguin editors write gramophone : layton gone , now only greenfield march . ( i take this opportunity say i still miss baroque critic nonpareil nicholas anderson . his moving gramophone bbc music magazine reason i started reading mag first place . ) finally , way rebutting previous reviews this page : you see above list record labels advertise gramophone , it no longer true ( if indeed it ever ) magazine kowtows " major " labels . fact , gramophone critics recommend many or more recordings such " indie " labels naive , harmonia mundi , hyperion , chandos , mdg , cpo , capriccio , glossa , linn , avie , lso live , telarc , etc . etc . they " major " labels : sony , rca , warner , universal . it certainly * not * true next quality recording more likely emerge mp3 file russia than new release " major " record company -- reason this simple : record labels -- all them , including indies -- today greatest artists under exclusive recording contracts . until likes vengerov , perahia , manze , biondi , minkowski , harnoncourt , jacobs , hundred others free agents making their own recordings , record labels remain relevant -- nay , indispensable -- ever . you won't find vpo , bpo , lahti so , or concertgebouw popping up obscure mp3 file either ! therefore , gramophone " business model " -- earning revenue record-label advertising -- hardly obsolete . quite contrary , moreover gramophone quick embrace " indie " labels such harmonia mundi ( mag " label year " last year ) ventures such lso sfo issuing their own in-house recordings . fact , reviewer below who predicts imminent demise gramophone ( extension all classical mags , including fanfare , diapason , bbc music magazine ) sounds much like gramophone-resenters classicstoday.com, who making same claims quite some time . such resenters their ilk apparently never learned this simple lesson : you cannot build yourself up simply tearing others down . ( attention classicstoday.com: want earn some critical clout ? then learn write , crying out loud ... take hurwitz , example , who routinely exclaims : " this best recording or , period . " period ? this supposed enlighten persuade me ? but pardon me , i rant digress . ) finally , even if we assume sake argument gramophone fanfare offer reader equal amount equally well-written reviews -- i'm really not convinced this true -- but assuming this so , i give nod gramophone all above reasons . fanfare doesn't offer superabundance information copious amount new releases reissues , therefore isn't useful tool staying current * all * new releases . i must admit -- call me superficial if you , but i must admit fanfare lack production values makes it relatively unappealing . fact , based its appearance feel , it reminds me slightly larger-sized version reader digest . i freely admit i love tactile visual qualities gramophone -- large glossy pages photos graphics ads all make very pleasurable perusal . contrast , fanfare seem like underground newsletter . i believe more than one critical perspective good thing , while i would certainly not discourage anyone subscribing fanfare , i still think gramophone obvious first choice	1

it true entrepreneur mag loaded ads -- but those ads interesting themselves . i always find it fascinating see what ads pop what ads junk -- it easy see difference . this opportunity develop your own advertising strategy ! content , there certainly room improvement . i personally enjoy entrepreneur profiles , though i wish they longer . i would like see more meat here . business several years now , i find most value this magazine comes front section where they list interesting tips , new products , survey results . not month goes i don't bookmark page so i follow up new product or check out website mentioned short piece . alone , low subscription price worth investmen t.t here lot information franchising , which great those interested this business model . though this not my personal cup tea , i still find it interesting read lists franchises notice trends popularity . who knew there so many pet service franchises available ! sure , it could use more real-world advice , but i still consider this one best general magazines available entrepreneurs . not every topic appeal every reader since we all run different kinds businesses seek different information . if you're looking something more specific your industry , trade magazine would make more sense . but i still recommend you keep your entrepreneur mag too so you keep eye climate small biz world .	-1

" type articles front interesting , exotic sometimes downright weird news knitting world ( like , who knew knitting could considered performance art ? ) . there usually exotic " catch-the-eye " or cutting-edge fashion project , followed other apparel projects always beautiful , visually appealing frequently wearable , too ! although magazine occasionally include items make me shake my head disbelief , interweave knits generally seems select projects real humans wear without looking like freaks . you'll also find couple ideas non-apparel and/or " quick gift " -type projects each issue , ranging felted backpacks novelty purses baby hats . now , if all this sounds good , just wait : it gets better . real clincher me patterns seem tested carefully proof-read before going press . i've worked 7 projects iwk this year , yet catch single mistake pattern directions ! maybe i've just lucky so far , but i noticed iwk website list errata amazingly short ... so either they don't update errata onto their website , or they really don't allow lot mistakes slip through . short , i think " interweave knits " provides lot bang your subscription bucks . two thumbs up me	1
