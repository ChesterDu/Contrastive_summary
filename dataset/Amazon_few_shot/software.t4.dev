one thing you find reading through many reviews dissatisfaction state filings . this my own experience this may last year i use taxcut because it . first all , it would not allow me e-file my state return but didn't explain why . i later discovered most states you apparently can't e-file partial year return . then when printing out state return it told me i also include form mentioned nowhere else program . i later found out taxcut not support all state tax forms ! i then get form fill it manually , then discovered i owed less than before because taxcut incorrectly calculated my capital gains . there nothing missing state form could not completed data program already . taxcut also advised me i could save $1000 off my fed bill contributing ira . so i opened ira contributed $4000 . when i went back taxcut entered details it told me i wasn't eligible any tax deduction . i ready tied up ! this software seriously dysfunctional . i'm guessing this stage you get idea . bottom line : i looking elsewhere complete my tax returns next year . oh , way , if like me you unable efile you paid efile option , you get credit hr calling 1-888-4taxcut option 2 , 2 , 0	-1

answer obvious : people seem compelled review products only if something went wrong their experience . short , people confuse review sites complaint forums . therefore , self-proclaimed dr. prog , i feel it my duty step out my usual mode reviewing progressive rock albums give honest , no nonsense review microsoft windows vista home premium . -the interface-ah , yes . you've heard all new windows vista aero interface now . virtually every screen shot you'll ever see feature aero . but it much more than just pretty , glass-like window frames . aero includes many new enhancements ui , such live thumbnails appear when you mouse-over minimized windows . name suggests , these actually update real time , so if there video or animation playing window , it appear live thumbnail . this very useful . perhaps less useful but scoring 8 1-10 " coolness factor " scale oft-mentioned 3d-flip , which allows user view three-dimensional representation all open windows , offering ability virtually paw through these bring desired window forefront . these things you'll hear most . what you don't hear so much all general changes made overall interface . new icons photo-realistic size-scalable . they start out little large , but you set them any size within wide spectrum . explorer windows radically redressed , new breadcrumbs backward navigation tool beats old address bar hands down ( you retrace your steps logical , step-by-step manner , instead using cryptic addresses ) . also , they're spruced up decorations recall visual aura style some new wallpapers . speaking which , these first time actually usable , unlike previous versions windows , where wallpapers small grainy . more general changes include absence menu bars most areas explorer , including ie . these replaced momentarily tap alt key , least until you learn how navigate without them . also , animations much better than previous versions windows , particularly one you see when copying file . addition , start menu reworked drastically . it doesn't even say " start , " anymore ; instead , it simply blue orb windows logo . first big change way programs accessed : gone delicate finicky ever-expanding hierarchy system , where slightly overzealous hand could miss mark close entire desired level . now , all programs button leads explorer-like listing folders , each clearly named , each which opens closes single mouse click . each time start menu opened , folders reset themselves . also , they automatically alphabetized . start menu also contains most system links usually found desktop ( computer , documents , etc . ) , which why only thing desktop first time you boot up recycle bin . , case you seen screen shots or tried out vista already , search bar bottom pulls double duty replacement run command utility . speaking search , though i seldom ever find myself wondering where my files ( i suppose i'm unique this respect ) , many people far more data keep track than me , thus they greatly appreciate enhanced pervasive searching facilities vista . there search boxes virtually everywhere explorer , including start menu . there even one ie7 , though it not integrated system search . but , you've probably noticed , this but list interface changes additions . i assure you list could go , i know i'll receive more than one comment reminding me some feature or other i've forgotten . i'll read those when they come add material necessary . but , aside this , how this new interface really impact end user ? perfectly honest , though it certainly pretty few parts it required little adjustment , it didn't feel much different previous windows versions me . but , honest , this good thing . perhaps you've heard it nightmare learn vista . that load hogwash . few things renamed , few things moved around , whole everything looks prettier . but it still windows ; it accomplishes same tasks it works virtually same it always . -included software bundle-taking hint apple , microsoft included compliment digital media manipulation software . while course ilife superior , there one issue must cleared up : ilife not integral part mac os you may led believe . older mac users must purchase it ; it only comes newer macs . therefore , microsoft windows vista , purely technical , offers most comprehensive digital media suite ever offered stock os . however , technicality seldom practical , microsoft inclusion no ilife killer . still , included calendar ( new vista ) , photo viewing editing application ( new ) , windows media player 11 , windows movie maker , windows dvd burning program ( new ) nothing scoff . no , they won't replace dedicated , professional stand-alone programs , but let honest : neither ilife . new internet explorer 7 step forward piece swiss cheese ie6 , insofar security . new features include phishing filter , tabbed browsing , improved security . additionally , ie7 runs protected mode , also called " sandbox . " idea this one application cordoned off rest system , thereby making it more difficult malicious software take control your computer . but that more security section review . new ie7 certainly more attractive than older versions , version vista offers enhanced visual appeal xp port software lacks . perfectly honest , i still use mozilla firefox ( mostly because i can't stand those blinking ads web pages , there firefox extension gets rid annoyance once all ) , but if i , i would no qualms using ie7 . new incarnation window media player really no different xp port . it still doesn't support aac , it still doesn't handle gapless playback . ipod user progressive rock fan , respectively , i gather only one thing these shortcomings : it time break out itunes . don't get me wrong : wmp not all bad tool . it still default player my system most audio types . however , once ipod owner prog rocker , always ipod owner/progger . i still say itunes king , if only because its interface cleaner , it supports my audio device , it offers gapless playback . i haven't extensively tested windows movie maker application , but i read it updated very slightly xp version . photo editing tool completely new vista , after little experimenting i pleased , though simple , controls offer nice results . this application par many basic image editing software packages you'll see offered digital cameras , printers , like . other applications yet receive my testing , only because i don't often burn dvd movies , i haven't entered event calendar ten years . far windows mail , i cannot objective because i never used outlook or outlook express . reports seem indicate windows mail simply dressed-up outlook express , many same features . i said , i never used mail program . call me old-fashioned , but i just check write my mail my internet browser . either way , i don't honestly believe microsoft would offer outlook-level functionality stripped down version outlook 2007 . all all , i rather impressed steps microsoft taken embrace digital media age . effort falls short ilife proprietary solutions this regard , but then , simply expected . i haven't really benefited tremendously new additions , but there certainly nothing wrong them , i know many people very happy this digital media suite . -security-this big picking point many people ( rightfully ) windows xp . it seems though there least two critical security updates every week . mac commercials definitely point , but that only because macs make up so small percentage market share ( though it indeed growing share ) it not advantageous malware written os users . even so , xp doesn't get free pass here . something . something security measures taken windows vista . " sandbox " already mentioned above , but other features added . one these , windows defender ( microsoft anti-spyware program ) , one those rare pieces software just perfect : it may not best what it , but it unobtrusive , it simple use , it totally completely free . leave it supplement your already existing spyware solution , you only benefit . also featured vista now infamous user account control ( uac ) . basically , it prompts you every time your computer basically anything , including installing programs , running some programs , updating settings , etc . , if you wondering , mac commercials it right : it really annoying . fair , you see far fewer these alerts once bulk your software installed , but until then you very , very sick uac . i don't advise this , but since i able get my anti-virus anti-spyware software up running vista , i finally turned off uac . symantic seems think this unwise , but norton virus scan doesn't bother me it other than recommend , its information page , i leave uac activated . yeah . like that going happen . beyond these broad , tangible aspects security , there lot new stuff under hood vista makes it less susceptible malicious attacks . mostly , unless you're very savvy , you don't need understand it all , frank , don't ask me because i haven't foggiest how it all works . i'm just glad it there . overall , i think microsoft made valiant effort security . i would still not advise running any windows operating system without active virus spyware protection , but least vista taken step right direction . plus , you likely anti-virus anti-spyware software running windows xp , which you then install vista . -the hardware-graphics : this part i waiting . everything i read up until i finally installed vista told me i needed dedicated graphics card least 256 mb memory order run aero . i'll honest : i fell it . i graphics card * my hand * , but way checkout i realized i left my gift certificate home . so i decided wait see how my hardware would react . this where i realized utter bias among tech community : i absolutely no trouble running aero integrated graphics . only makes sense because my setup rather typical : 17 " flat panel monitor modern computer . this what majority people moment , this size , ig should no trouble running aero . now use logic : if you want run dual 24 " widescreen monitors , yeah , you'll need graphics card . especially since i don't believe there even exists dual monitor-capable ig motherboard ( if there such thing , it certainly not available oem consumer market ) . but if you fairly typical single monitor scenario computer you bought within past few years , you should no trouble all insofar graphics . don't fooled . if you want absolutely sure , however , there no harm -- plenty good sense -- downloading microsoft free upgrade advisor utility see if your setup any way deficient . plus , if you find you can't run aero any reason , you going upgrade vista anyway , so you still buy dedicated graphics point . you don't need top-of-the-line card unless you want make this excuse foray into gaming ; older technology get you up running very reasonable prices . ram : there one area , however , where many computers deficient : ram . oddly enough , while many sources pushing graphics card brigade , almost equally strong force -- computer manufacturers themselves -- seems think ram no big deal . trust me : if you've ever tried run windows xp 256 mb ram , it painful experience . that what vista like 512 mb -- you don't even want go there . dell shockingly honest when they qualify " minimum " vista requirement 512 mb ram ( per microsoft ) " great booting operating system , without running any applications or games . " this where most people upgrade their machines . 1 gb perfectly acceptable ; if you want true multitasking power ( you dual-core processor support it ) , then go 2 gb or more . most people , however , 1 gb fine . my first two vista machines 1 gb it works perfectly . i warn you , though , often times memory installed pairs , so your 512 mb most likely two 256 mb modules . paired method offers better performance , but it make upgrading system only two memory slots somewhat expensive ( though not exorbitant any means ) . but this not somewhere you want skimp , so least one pair 512 mb memory modules should your list extra hardware if you only 512 mb memory currently installed . processor : this perhaps most accurate terms hype . you'll need least 1 ghz processor run aero . many computers such processors don't even support 1 gb ram , so if you're situation , you definitely looking new computer vista pre-installed . however , these very old machines this point , most us something slightly newer . one myth needs dispelled dual-core processors run vista better than single-core cpus : vista , most part , based microsoft server 2003 code , which , turn , based xp code , both which came before advent multi-core processing . therefore , effect operating system run , there only marginal difference single-core or dual-core cpu , provided both use identical core architectures . course any applications take advantage multi-threading benefit multiple cores , but this , , always case , independent operating system . question simply whether you see yourself multitasking more vista . if that case , then new computer dual-core processor installed probably your best bet ; if you're fine your current setup , then it most likely run vista aero without any problems . it interesting note , however , some upgrade aptitude utilities some small quirks give conflicting non-real results . example , such utility offered advanced micro devices ( amd ) passed both my a64 x2-based machines without hitch . however , when whim i ran it my old p4-based desktop , utility seemed think 2.40 ghz pentium 4 northwood ( 533 fsb ) would insufficient run vista . i smell amd bias , even though i happen favor amd over intel . just take what such utilities tell you grain salt , remember microsoft own utility likely most reliable . generally , your processor not issue when upgrading vista . hard drive : again , this one pretty straightforward . if you 40 gb hard drive or better , you're good go . if you don't , hard drives so cheap these days you could easily least triple your current capacity what it costs take family out dinner one evening ( amazon not allow price figures , hence my vagueness regarding pricing throughout this review ) . things get interesting when you consider dual boot scenario . this when you two operating systems running same system , either same or different hard drives . my honest opinion , this best way go because you get keep your current operating system ( just case you run into problems vista ) , you also get vista . keep mind , order run vista same hard drive your current os , you'll need install each os separate partition . you either purchase third party partitioning tool , or what i , which use ubuntu linux live boot disc built-in partitioning utility . course there risk involved this last solution ( but , my experience , i've used it dozens times no problems ) , so latter only your own risk . -compatibility-this where most horror stories come . both hardware software compatibility nightmares flitting around denser clusters than fish flies june . up until recently , anti-virus anti-spyware programs unable install vista . addition , many proprietary printer applications incompatible , yet printer itself often times function perfectly . graphics sound card drivers still haven't really caught up , despite fact they've little over two years so . i won't deny , if your system just happens roll snake eyes , you're some hell . but it not half bad you hear . i installed vista without hitch ; there separate part process where os scans system hardware , installs necessary drivers , then generates list anything doesn't install properly . every piece hardware i recognized . addition , my printer recognized installed five seconds , despite fact its own software would not install ( its maker , hp , still hadn't posted vista-compatible version ) . even my usb internet modem , which upgrade advisor flat out said would not work vista , installed ran perfectly when i supplied drivers manufacturer website . fact , vista shipped exponentially more drivers than any edition xp . plus , it possible supply drivers manufacturers ' websites odd , esoteric bit hardware isn't immediately detected . sometimes it work , sometimes not . but this only expected when upgrading new os . i don't seem remember everything rosy when xp came out , either . this yet item strong support dual boot scenario . software no different hardware . all my software titles , possible exception ancient original roller coaster tycoon , work flawlessly vista . latter didn't work windows xp mce 2005 , either , so i don't blame vista this . if your software acts buggy or otherwise just won't work , check manufacturer website . if it fairly recent title , there most likely some compatibility patches or whole new version application , all free charge . just ready insert your product key , if required , latter case . now course chances if you some pet application mid-nineties , it might kick up few dickens . again , strong case dual boo t.t he final perhaps most prolific source upgrade hell , ironically , upgrade itself . this process works performing in-place upgrade already existing operating system ( xp ) . these sorts upgrades notorious problems , vista crop no exception . however , since you're currently viewing full version page , this obviously isn't issue you . just remember , best ways install vista either clean installation ( if necessary obliterating existing os ) or dual boot scenario . anything else you might experience problems . but this always case in-place upgrades . -overall-i thank you reading this far . most people won't . i know this pretty long , but i wanted get it all out there people read . vista not bad operating system . i absolutely floored it ? it may require some more time , but it hasn't revelation microsoft promised . this somewhat disappointing , yet , somewhat reassuring well . i didn't suffer any downtime because i couldn't figure out how operating system works , i didn't any glaring compatibility issues , my computer worked virtually error-free ever since i first installed os . short , change , while not mind blowing , wasn't drastic or disturbing , either . end day , just remember : it windows . love it or leave it , it just microsoft operating system . vista same thing xp earlier editions ; it not source inspiration or drive . it only good person who using it .	1

coreldraw my first foray into vector graphics back when version 3 showed up my desk small " mom pop " screenprinting shop i worked . back then , corel came oodles free fonts , clipart , manuals ... not mention free technical support via toll-free number . i stayed corel exclusively until version 10 ... enduring countless patches , bugs dreaded " odd-numbered " curse ( if you tried version 5 or 7 , you feel my pain ) . adobe photoshop always my photo-editing program choice ... corelphotopaint just never quite " it " me . industry demands eventually delegated i delve into adobe illustrator . already familiar adobe photoshop features , tools " look feel " , illustrator didn't present huge , overbearing learning curve . illustrator , i found same robust features coreldraw ... which wasn't what impressed me illustrator . adobe intuitive programs , their ability interact one ... seamlessly ... what won me over illustrator . illustrator ability edit/create pdf their native format ? wow ! exporting layered vector files photoshop ... layers intact ??? wow !!! ( i could go on)now , said ... there still things i prefer coreldraw compared illustrator . extrude function corel much easier utilize . powerclip function more user friendly than illustrator " make clipping mask " function . ability customize/edit/add shortcut keys amazing feature . ( again ... i could go ) ( edit : i learned this possible illustrator cs2 via edit/keyboard shortcuts , or alt+shift+ctrl+k)in regards importing exporting files other applications , coreldraw wins , hands down . it boasts robust set import export filters , my favorite . eps import filter which lets you import . eps while converting fonts curves during import . this must if you work . eps file created computer whose fonts you lack . if i dollar every . eps pulls into illustrator fonts blown out ... i'd independently wealthy . why illustrator never implemented this beyond me . so , sum it up ... coreldraw great program ... but i can't imagine it my only vector drawing program . just like real life , you need great team . this program , paired adobe creative suite , meets my needs perfectly .	1

* this upgrade edition*we should cover few things editions before we review vista . " starter " very basic limited 256mb memory . almost everything good vista omitted . " home basic " not aero graphics flip windows special effects . " home premium " limited networking interaction . " vista business " extended networking interaction . " vista enterprise " unix virtual machine support . " ultimate " all bells whistles . carefully choose what you want before you make this expensive purchase . installing vista very easy . checking hardware vendors patches updates must . " windows vista upgrade advisor " identify changes needed . many notebook manufacturers recommend updates pre-install patch before vista upgrade . vista upgrade identify software system might not compatible . depending compatibility issues upgrade , clean install also optional works notebooks although driver installations must after . install sequence matter few clicks vista up running . this might not so simple if vista loaded virtualization platform like vmware which requires additional configurations bios some other tweaks . we come long way since days windows 3.1 insert disc #10 . first thing strikes user sheer speed which vista launches . this most certainly microsoft fastest os date . soon vista loads up , low behold " gadgets " display appears desktop moving pictures , cpu meter , real-time news feeds , real-time weather , clock , notes , stock exchange , calendar contacts . wow , impressive stuff ... but let stop press moment tell it like it ... gadgets just apple osx " widgets " ripped-off ( some might say widgets existed before separate plug-ins yahoo called " konfabulator " , but we talking this inherently part os , not plug-ins ) . it apple invention demand , much like need desktop recycle bin ( which apple didn't patent , doh ! ) . microsoft settles just straight out burglary apple innovation hopes user just enjoys it . truth-be-told , modern times when everyone downloading everyone else stuff free , microsoft even game , making money it . however this all competition . since competition exists ( we may some things say ms monopoly ) we should thankful other forces driving ms what it may not without these pressures . who really cares if vista ultimately apple osx rip ? this what microsoft always . same time apple openly accepted command line interface , ms right-click save or open intel chips . balance things out . if you don't like microsoft , then you know where go . third party software probably sway you one way or . however seeing osx86 boot vmware top vista something makes you stop think . linux users simply front `customization ' bonus not going windows many ways they big point make . vista same lockdown start menu system . you just can't change it or put any folder anywhere you want . way this creates standard ( " where johnny keep his documents this system ? " " oh yeah , documents folder ! " ) , while same time professional users just want custom start menu way they like it , but can't . microsoft hasn't really got whole pile originality going here ( although there many gizmos included bundled ultimate pack ) all intents purposes vista osx . vista great . its fast , fast , fast 3ghz pentium 4 or 1.66 ghz core duo . 1gb ram run it no problem . first thing open pile windows , hold down windows start key + tab , press tab repeatedly watch screen turns into flip 3d windows ( new aero system ) . also you get thumbnail preview each running window task bar rolling mouse over it . very impressive . no longer we pinned down one desktop . just scrolling through multiple windows 3d sight behold eyes many make upgrade worth every penny . vista also looks whole world better than xp no longer plagued boring sterile look . vista art but then again gadgets play enormous role this . apart , windows now beautiful fade fade out windows , some which transparent so you see windows underneath . this whole new art dimension windows never presented before many ways thankfully somebody decided higher graphic designer all money they make . installing office 2007 just brings it all life , but story . 99% xp software run vista . only problem comes software creates virtual drives devices . it seems vista security ( although vista cracked already ) trying prevent people loading up iso software like daemon tools . no doubt however someone out there punch hole through one . 70gigs worth software running xp here installed no problem vista ... no bsod ( blue screens death ) or serious flaw seems apparent . while some software not like way it installed , using windows own manual driver installation just overcame those issues . something so brand new it hard fault how stable this . xp users complain they only just learned xp see no reason why they need vista . right now nobody `needs ' vista . however microsoft indicated some games ( especially xbox ports like halo 2 ) software only vista compatible . if you like oss like what cutting edge then don't hold back moment longer get it . if you need system absolutely solid , then try out vista test system few weeks see . you might inclined wait vista sp1 but honest i see no reason why most people not use this , right out box , right now . like i said , i ported my xp software over vista just stable ... surprise !... well not really . since win2k , microsoft got their stability issues sorted out apple seems just exploitable these days anybody who reading see it . very existence osx86 proves this . vista gives you little future boost too probably main reason want it . this going future windows oss next few years . last time windows released os around time 911 . it 6 years , longest gap microsoft oss history , it worth wait , especially imagining what vista sp2 deliver . many us still hoping lot big things change though . why we still using keyboards why we interface our hardware this way ? bring multi-user touch-screen pc give us real show ! don't you think we all deserve it ? we . bottom line here this stable future-tech . if makes your eyes go bing then don't hold back second more just get this thing . you very pleased experiencing rush new os once again .	1
