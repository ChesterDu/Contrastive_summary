strap/links these g-shocks quite oversized : when i first got it , i could fit watch around my legs ! ( you'll most likely get links adjusted ) . ironically , four side buttons watch small . so even if you huge wrist , you'll probably trouble pressing buttons ! ( not huge fingers ) *** beware *** picture shows four side buttons watch silver , but left right side buttons this model actually plain black ! it quite misleading ! silver side button actually mtg920dj model ( which 2005 version ) . according casio , mtg920da actually released 2004 black side buttons . if you search casio website , it only display mtg920dj ( their most recent version ); most websites still sell mtg920da just taking latest mtg920dj version picture casio website . mtg920dj seems same features this one ( mtg920da ) , except four side ( left right ) buttons silver . those you wondering three circles watch : first one very left basically wannabe-analog display - basically , every five minutes , bar increases ( or decreases when it gets full ); it just mostly there cosmetic reasons . second one middle battery status ; it ( low ) , ( medium ) , ( high ) bar would display one those areas . if you get out sun lot or know area your home where sun shines lot , then you won't problem battery ever going below high . moreover , it power saving feature ; watch go into sleep mode ( display off ) when it completely dark area long time . finally , third circle very right where it tells you what options enabled/disabled . it shows spl ( split time stopwatch ) , dst ( daylight saving time ) , sig ( hourly signal ) , alm ( alarm ) , snz ( snooze ) , auto el ( automatic electro-luminescent backlight - backlight turns tilting it certain degree towards your face without manually press backlight button . ) keep mind , synchronizing atomic signal not instant : it usually takes around 3 minutes ( least me , i live california . ) if you're busy area or near electronic , it might difficult ; try again or move different area . moreover , it should show you strength/level ( 4 levels ) signal ( while you're synchronizing ) satellite icon watch . there also feature automatically synchornizes you while you're sleeping 2:00 am , 3:00 am , 4:00 am , 5:00 am . therefore , it not always necessary syncronize it yourself because time you wake up , it should ready go . overall , this watch attractive fun wear . atomic radio signal feature very cool ; official time great - right precise second ! i've this watch months now , i enjoy wearing it daily . this watch lot feature - except , it pity it *** not *** countdown timer ! pros : - cool design - water/scratch resistant ; g-shock known their toughest watches . ( update : i've worn this watch daily almost year half now not single scratch - still looks brand new ! )- solar power ; battery life excellent ; never power ever go below high . power saving feature . - position time date easy read one glance . - metal strap - display world time local time cons : - side buttons small tight press ( must use like very tip fingers ) - atomic signal takes too long manually , it usually not possible synchronize while wearing watch ; if you're inside home , it usually best take off watch leave it near window . - alarm beep little longer perhaps ( even my inexpensive timex watch would beep it would gradually beep faster , which i actually like bit better . ) - no countdown timer . ( how could they forget this ?! ) also , try research other models instead finding out hard way ( like i side buttons ) before purchasing .	-1

this my second one these winders , so obviously i'm fan . winds my rolexes few other eta autos perfectly , but it doesn't seem keep my seiko kinetic diver or panerais wound sufficiently . still , far i'm concerned , it spreads lubrication enough keep watches good health . price point , this winder cannot beat i purchase more future . auto timer keeps winder running cool . fairly silent rotation , depending watch . while gear rotations themselves completely silent , sometimes there slight shift watch it goes around , which makes repetitive sound . nothing i can't live . highly recommended	-1

i got watch off amazon birthday gift i must say i'm impressed . it looked good picture here , it looks even better person ! i read arm hair pulling problem i don't any problems but that probably because i'm only 15 i'm asian so my arm hair isn't exactly long so i no answer . my arm only 2.5 or so inches wide so i'm skinny needless say , watch still fits me fine after removing some links . time accurate what i tell , but i little trouble setting date , wouldn't turn past thursday first though i got it fowarding time next day . i don't know if it problem or not since i haven't read guide yet . thing i'm impressed fact this watch solid titanium . even middle links . many cheaper watches hollow inside links , but not this one , it solid titanium all way through . others said , markers really very bright dark , i tested it completely dark room i able tell time no trouble all . i would recommend this watch anyone looking stylish watch that not too pricy . it great everyday wear so don't hesitate if you think it too formal . if i , 15 year old thinks it not too formal , it probably isn't :) . hope this helps some your decisions	1

this really great watch . i am firefighter i need watches stand toughest environments ..... i always wear g-shock . already owned g-shock before buying this watch , i know this thing last me lifetime . great thing this particular watch not only it durability genuine g-shock , it also great looks . i wear this watch nice outfit people think i'm wearing really expensive watch . little they know i only spent less than $100 it . some other cool features this watch auto time setting via atomic clock especially solar power . all my life i dealt watches need battery replacement , after wearing watch long time screws back cover become permanently attached case , battery replacement becomes pain *$% ! this watch other hand you never need worry batteries ..... simply put it window sill when it says it needs charging . lastly , i love light-up feature . no need fumble any buttons watch light up read time dark . watch smart enough sense ambient light its solar cells know if light-up feature needs activated . so if you out sun look your watch , light doesn't come . also , great feature light also it never drains battery . if you happen drain battery ( which would like never happen unless you've living dark like year ) , simply place watch under desk lamp or window during day . darn thing charges itself if you walk around without front watch covered . i love this watch grown ever so confident casio it life g-shock watches . you never go wrong this watch	1
my boyfriend just got me this necklace i love it ! very beautiful piece jewelry . i've gotten lot comments it just few days ! :) very happy .	1
i surprised how well it worked ended up buying second one . it costs only fraction price others same thing . while it cheap plastic case , it doesn't look bad virtually noiseless . if you very heavy watch i would recommend single winder version since watch angle flatter ( heavy watches cause verical two-watch winder bang around little ) . my winder running non-stop past couple months no problems . this device good value what you pay	1
nice product . works very well . bit large ... smaller version would easier leave out countertop	-1
good quality jewlery . timely manner shippping . good company buy	1
instruction manual not very accurate . watch seems work advertised . one reviewer here mentioned they couldn't pull pin out adjust time , per instructions manual . i same problem , but what they forgot mention you turn pin counter clock-wise , then pin pop out little , then one pull pin out adjust time . when you , you reverse . so far , i am happy my purchase . smart looking watch	-1

this my second skagen . it much thinner than my older watch . 7-year old watch still works perfectly , but i wanted new treat . i think this watch great in-between formal informal . goldtone really sparkles crystals face add touch elegance . one features i like most skagen mesh bands they adjustable . amazon price great ! i highly recommend this watch .	1
great watch everyday wear . not fancy , but works very well easy read . this watch bargain	1
this box great budding watch collector , but aware larger men watches like seiko monsters tuna cans , or anything 40mm+ don't fit well this box . they accommodated storing them loose compartment without pillow , but tends defeat appeal storage system this type . more average-sized men women timepieces , it excellent choice , quality much better than expected this price point	-1
excellent service , fast delivery , worth every buck you spent !!! i able buy this seiko very very low price ! its sleek fashionable , perfect gift my wife valentines day ! you wont regret buying this watch ! =	1
this really good-looking watch . unlike other bracelet watches i , this one not snag hair my arm . face slightly smaller than most standard mens watches , which makes good fit me because i'm thin . matte color dark gray face give very tasteful look works just any occasion , either dressy or casual . i liked this watch so much when i lost original one i replaced it exact model . ( i bought original 3 years ago department store $240 . )	1
nice watch , advertised , only issue band clasp isn't real secure releases easily	-1
these simply beautiful earrings ! very comfortable stylish . they worn any occasion . i get many compliments them	1
