no way change inputs your tv . dvd functions tv functions accessed alternatly pressing " tv " button but there no way tell which romote aligned . therefore when you press power button you no idea which you powering on/off , tv or xbox . if things couldn't get any dumber , if you press eject button while remote tv mode it doesn't work . eject button only designed work xbox yet it disabled when tv mode ? there also no option program receiver . many others mentioned , this remote looks nice but people who designed it must drunk . not buy this remote unless you like wasting your money garbage	-1
opening cutscene introduces you blinx cat , supporting cast particulars his upcoming adventures , i found myself trying wrap my brain around basic premise story . idea secret , off-world clan humanoid cat creatures , armed souped up vacuum cleaners , responsible development dispersal time itself every known plane existence map . it seems time , when compressed tightly enough transported said cats , takes form one five different brightly-colored shapes . if these crystals left out open too long without properly introduced flow things , they turn into monsters . i could go , because game certainly doesn't stop there , but i think you get point . i like think there fairly thick line drawn cartoony fantasy super-detailed realism . generally , lot physics environmental details taken granted realistic game , because they're almost exclusively set photorealistic , lifelike location . cartoons , other hand , generally don't worry themselves particulars primarily concerned delivering good time . how much fun would wile . coyote cartoons if every time lead character suffered grisly fate , it strictly obeyed laws gravity aerodynamics ? blinx tries straddle thick line delivering story that overly detail-centric environment that right out kid show . result tale comes off way , way out left field almost completely abstract . it focuses things would better left viewer imagination ignores importance good underlying story way . beneath needless discussions why there monsters world , how time compression works how cats actually responsible all we hold dear , actual plot almost laughably straightforward generic . there princess , evil pigs kidnapped her , it up you you only rescue her save her world . that it , no side-stories , no reasoning , no subplots - just straightforward rush point point . here i thought phrase " save princess " universally recognized ages-old cliche . now , i don't want it sound like i'm railing this game just because it got few more nitpicky details than its peers it reuses old phrase way back platformer handbook its sole driving factor . it also completely lacking character development , general storytelling ongoing inspiration . none characters blinx really establish themselves individuals , including lead character himself . you don't hate pig spaceship because he trying destroy world , you hate him because every time he shows up he tries steal your money . i honestly forgot there princess end game after level three , because she never mentioned game start its finish . i mean , very first super mario brothers least reminded you princess castle end every boss fight . i don't honestly think game really designed enjoyable so much it geared overly challenging . first level half set up standard " get know you " format , simplest enemies , most routine stage layouts plenty opportunities mess around your tools . shortly thereafter , you're thrown wolves . most part , level designs very short , more emphasis cheap hits than complexity true challenge . i noticed lot overlap stage layouts , whether it retracing your steps time time again or walking catwalk ( har har ) above beginning stage invariably plummeting back start point . you'll almost always know what needs , but actually accomplishing act real trick . i just can't overemphasize how unbearably cheap most this game really . if there bottomless pit nearby , ( chances very good there ) blinx find way force himself into it , regardless what you're hitting control pad . if there enemy two feet front you you hit attack button , he'll aim random switch other side room , rather than imminent threat . that not say entirety time sweeper totally without merit , because it bring few fresh ideas table , but most part those insights hampered their surroundings . ability control time , instance , time really fresh , interesting new play mechanic still stands out today , despite limited field imitators since emerged . you rewind few seconds catch enemy unaware or rebuild crumbling bridge , pause action take advantage frozen time , knock level into slow motion , etc . all while , blinx moving around real time . it great idea , but implementation painfully short underutilized . why can't i use two controls same time ? why don't more aspects stage encourage player experiment solve problems these powers ? why doesn't ridiculous ten minute stage time limit pause , speed up or rewind when i use my time powers ? why their duration so brief , why can't i hold more than dozen uses time ? i mean , this could've really fantastic experience if time control aspect beefed up little further treated more than just auxiliary function otherwise run-of-the-mill platformer . controls , too , undeveloped , undertested nightmare . blinx himself often sluggish respond , especially when implementing his time controls . he difficulty making precise turn , whether midair or solid ground . he stops briefly celebrate when gaining item , which leaves him open constant enemy attacks . he routinely moves direction certain death , though pulled magnetic field , whether you've instructed him so or not . he'll occasionally refuse perform double jump , particularly when attempting difficult , precise leap across gaping chasm . i think it these controls most make blinx so mind-squashingly aggravating . glance , you'd imagine they'd fairly difficult screw up . you've got jump button , suction / fire button , time control button analog stick control movement . plus , there already long , established line three-dimensional platformers market years before title release , paving way ideal control experience . super mario 64 its issues , sure , but nothing like this , it trailblazer entire genre jump world 3d . it like they map leading them right treasure decided forge their own path anyway . i can't even say i'm impressed graphics showcased throughout time sweeper , either . exception lead character himsef , these some incredibly cheesy , preschoolish character designs - they feel unfinished hurried , less purposeful than you'd imagine ( especially contrast blinx himself ) . particularly insulting large population simple blobs roam around levels , trying vain bump into you cause fatal injury . here finely detailed main character , such close attention paid his wardrobe even gloss his shoes obviously debated time time again , he pitted against set monsters could've sprung life directly out pages four-year-old sketchbook . despite featuring spoken dialog track , there no english voice acting . i couldn't pinpoint language , but my wife seems think it either french or some close variation it . it certainly didn't sound japanese . while this add touch personality title , it not every day you get chance hear cat shouting something language love , it all seemed really odd out place coming out my television . everyone vocal personalities so black-and-white , too , i feel like great chance establish some much-needed individuality amongst cast lost once again here . bad guys all same deep , gravelly , transparently evil tone , while good guys all bright , cheery , squeaky high-pitched like monkeys super monkey ball . it like parody games come before , but i won't give developers enough credit assume they doing it purpose . overall , blinx really just few promising concepts thrown together one package , strapped shell far-below-average third person platformer unleashed upon unsuspecting public . time its release , it still need lot polishing , some serious scrutiny behind closed doors re-evaluation just how far some these concepts half-hearted character designs could conceivably stretched without losing any quality . top , i really don't know which audience they targeting it . game ridiculously difficult , which betrays childlike demeanor surrounds it leads me believe it meant serious gamers out there , but so bright , kid-friendly annoyingly cutesy i can't imagine anyone demographic rushing out stores release day . number spontaneous controller hurls shot through roof during my time blinx , reaching near-marvel vs . capcom 2 levels its unashamed , excruciatingly cheap hits , especially later levels . i no idea how i acquired willpower finish level eigh t.t he game adequately lengthy , offers some replay value , hidden cat medals each stage eventually unlocking production sketches , promotional materials like . once you start hunting floating cat heads those super-tough later levels , though , you'll remember why you so happy finished them first place . unless you feel like pulling your hair out clumps ( i shaved my head after experience part cleansing process ) enjoy self-mutilation , i'd recommend you stay far away	-1
i used my remote all 8 times before it stopped working . even proprietary dongle inserted into controller slot you cannot control this thing controller , you must use remote control . when you take dongle out dvd , screen come up telling reinsert , so if either dongle or remote get slightly injured or malfunction , then you've just wasted thirty bucks . i feel quite ripped off . low cost dvds nowadays , it much better idea buy standalone imho , you get good progressive scan $30 or $40 , which comes out same price . side , it also extremely annoying you can't turn , or off device remote , you must go up box it yourself , especially annoying if you just want watch dvd your bed crash afterwards . all all value proposition offered this product very low considering similarly priced alternatives	-1

this game , simply put , not good . i got bored tears playing it , then ended up giving it away because it robbing useful space my desk . it slow-paced , predictable , not suspenseful all . fact , these characteristics probably why it so mainstream , even though it laughable comparison real first-person shooters , which way don't even belong consoles . owning this game means you average player . any true fps gamer knows what childish , pathetic garbage this , while rest just go hype . many successfully deceived themselves into thinking it worth anything all . it isn't	-1

i start off saying if you own 06 version , then dont bother updating , you may not notice many updates/upgrades . this awesome game ? yes , but it few holes even still ; 1 ) too much sacking your qb cpu . 2)the cpu run ball so darn often , it joke . 3)the game might strain your ps2 it loads so often , 4)if you want play all-madden level , you forced play qb vision , which we all know stinks ! basically , they tossed few more options so you play blocker or etc offense you more advanced defensive controls such match-ups , assignments , etc . also , franchise mode still really great superstar mode quite enjoyable well . what this game really good ? well , it safe say graphics quite good commentary solid once again . crispness passing great running game big part this years focus . it still really fun running qb strong arm , it easy way dominate game ! btw , new kicking scheme actually really easy after test it out time or two , now i am making 90% fg easily ! you fully tinker ai change all other settings well . rosters also accurate but personally , if you own madden 06 , wait 4-6 more weeks then buy this one $19 ps2 best game	1
fable easily one greatest games ever released . story boy who grows up become hero still wants revenge tragedy his past , it compelling very entertaining . gameplay excellent , it not your typical rpg since this plays like action/adventure game . i love how you choose good or bad choices you make reflect what your character looks like . game also plays like real life . you get married , divorced , sex buy houses , even decorate them ! game so real you choose straight , gay or bi-sexual depending who you sleep . only thing missing you can't children , but should change future installments . cool thing game more evil you get , more people afraid you . but , more hero savior you become , you greeted praise clapping every town you go . overall , this game must !!! replay value extremely high . i played beat game many times i'm still not tired it ! if you love rpgs or hate rpgs this still fantastic . i can't wait until fable 2 released , which currently completed . get this , it simply amazing !	1

i just finished hl2 xbox thought some my observations might helpful other prospective buyers . my review primarily concerned my struggle getting hl2 pc or xbox . i bought hl , hl opposing force hl blue shift pc when they came out thoroughly enjoyed them . due hl2 xbox price horror stories i'd read online use pc version hl2 , i decided go xbox version . i make right choice ? hl2 very good game $20 xbox version , represents excellent value money . great graphics , great sound engaging game play . however , i think hl1 pc better game than hl2 xbox . why ? first , original hl much more open ended there often more than one way something or get somewhere . hl2 , i found there only one way . second , controls hl1 better configurable . hl2 xbox , i found some controls really awkward difficult use . example , there air boat drive direction throttle same thumb stick . i assume throttle direction separate keys pc version ? third , when there lot going , example , several combine soldiers firing you , explosions fair bit scenery display , xbox slowed down almost halt ! it just couldn't cope amount processing . i never problem hl1 pc assume suitably equipped pc could cope hl2 just well . lastly , others mentioned you didn't go very far hl2 before you saw `loading ' screen . frequency which you saw this become distracting annoying after while . one plus hl2 there no weird psychedelic alternative dimension like there hl1 . remember all hopping floating platform floating platform plants light up when you went near them ? all nonsense gone away which relief ! reflection , most my gripes hl2 more xbox version rather than game itself . if i choose again , i'd buy hl2 pc certainly get any hl2 spin off games pc if they appear like they hl1 . if not , i'll wait hl3 which ending hl2 leaves open .	1

i always hear these things , mainly point it unrealistic , noone uses teamwork , people too preoccupied their stats , etc , etc . may true many public servers , though there quite few aren't filled morons , actually people who play teamlike fashion , complete their objective over killing off enemy time given . i am one those people who actually go objective . actually , i am admin server , if terrorist last , camping out round , then i slay him warn him stay task . onto point- many people claim this so unrealistic , it may true points like m249 slow shooter , very cumbersome , too good aim standing up , fact you die 2 shots toe awp- those all unrealistic points , but if you think it , how much fun would it unload 5 clips half killt he enemy ? * cough halo cough * yes , i just insulted halo , because enemies too damn strong , it drives me crazy , multiplayer so annoying you shoot enemy 3 shots sniper kill ... my final point there people who aren't just preoccupied their stats , there servers dedicated fun- yes , fun , counterstrike . they whole slew crazy maps , ways make it even more insane , things such . if you interested try custom map servers . all-in-all this game peak perfection- not even mentioning huge amounts customization involved this game , weapons player models	1

xenosaga : episode 3 ( also sprach zarathustra ) brings back magic episode 1 fixes vast majority problems occurred episode 2 . story here , rich complex ever , brought appropriate moving close shion company battle uncover deep-seated conspiracy unlike anything else they've ever encountered . fabric story itself , voice acting , cutscenes all truly superb - it remarkable makers namco/bandai managed pull all loose ends together make story finally make sense . boot , it pleasure watch listen -- who could ask more ? battle system , it finally regains its fun episode 3 . i simply wasn't fan episode 2 system , so return " basics " blessing my mind . characters still battle their unique ways , each his/her own customizable skills obtain , but long gone days ridiculously long battles against painfully weak enemies . here , both ground e.s. ( mech ) battles , your ability strengthen customize your party shines through you always rewarded your hard work . replay value moderate-to-high well , since your party consists all familiar players most game ; if you habit using same three or four people ( like me ; yay chaos ! ) , you always play through again different group . shops return this episode , making buying selling your merchandise once again possible . only thing lacking this game little more " extras/side quests " department , which this game only offers handful . while some these take longer than others , few more side quests would nice , particularly since this last series . i can't rave enough how impressed i this title . it rivals episode 1 every way possible , trilogy epic story outstrips other rpg competition without question . if you're looking fun battles , fantastic story , beautiful graphics , then look no further ; xenosaga : episode 3 you . i only hope someone changes their mind decides make one -- after this exceptional closing episode , it hard not wish game come future . very highly recommended . summary : story : a+cutscenes : agraphics/rendering : abattle/skill system : aextras/side quests : a-replay value : moderate-to-hig	1

i love this game i it snes it one my favorite	1
simply put , xenogears + xenosaga 1 absolute best storyline , best role playing experience ps2 date . i strongly believe xenosaga 2 best storyline any rpg i ever , ever played , including final fantasy 7 , xenogears , hundreds others . because rpgs strongly reliant storyline gameplay , i consider this pinnacle role playing ps2 . final fantasy comes close , star ocean , but terms storyline , this game beats them . however , i mark down few other minor flaws . this game highly niche game , only those who enjoy style , sci fi setting . it also very short ..... 20 hours if you play straight through ( no leveling up ) . maybe 38-42 hours if you take up side-quests want strong character . gameplay : first xenosaga highly relied cut scenes narrative . fact , i absolutely could not stand battle system . xenosaga episode 2 still relies heavily upon storytelling through hours cut scenes , but it fixes battle system . battle system , simply put , one most fun turn-based systems i ever experienced . while xenosaga episode 1 battle system seemed slow unwieldy , episode 2 fast paced , action packed , highly challenging battle system . you 3 characters screen just all times , these characters switched off manner much like ffx , but it costs turn this game , causing it more tactical . each turn you many options ; you attack ( more various attacks later ) , stock ( save turn next turn order get combo ) , use ether ( read : magic ) , or change your battle party . if you choose attack , there whole slew options here well . most importantly learning weak points enemy . every enemy , including bosses , certain attack combination most effective against them . when you attack , you press either square , which zone attack , triangle , which zone attack , or circle , which zone attack . certain characters also zone attack , but this only against flying opponents . you must expierament enemies order learn zones they weakest . sometimes , you may required ' stock ' turn order attack enemy its weak zone . " what advantage attacking weak zones ? " you ask . well , it allows large scale , damage pounding comboes absolutely essential this game . once you hit all enemy weak zones , you " break " them . this involves circle button . once character ' broken ' , they tossed into air , or attacked while prone ground . this add up tons damage if you plan your boosting right . boosting integral part combat system . pressing r1 button brings up 3 slot meter which sometimes empty , but it may feature character potraits some your characters . if you press r1 , then button ( square , triangle , or circle ) character potrait , they boost forward , immediately after acting unit taken its turn , this new character turn . enemies , however , take advantage all these systems well . if you not plan well , or randomly attack without comboes , enemy break you , boost ahead several times , easily destroy one your characters one short , brutal assault . countless times my entire party destroyed simple enemies should no problem , merely because i not plan ahead . you get very , very used seeing game over screen . plus side this difficulty you feel real exhiliration when you win , it great accomplishment . note even power levelling , it won't help you much some situations , believe me , i tried . finally , there ether . ether skills basically magic , if you know anything rpgs all , then you know basically what present here , healing ether skills , attack ether skills , nothing big . i forgot mention e.s. units . these basically mechs , called a.g.w.s. episode 1 . many points game involve you using these move around fight , now they independant battle system . it basically same one your characters screen , except you only one attack turn , no comboes or anything like . it just added piece fun already awesome game . there skill system place . after every battle you earn class pointss and/or skill points . these spent getting new ether skills , or new upgrades your characters make them more resilient when you equip them . every character same skill set , this minor flaw slightly brings down gameplay score , but not overall enjoyment least . finally , one other flaw gameplay there no weapons , no armor . both these rpg standard fare , it seems kind odd not either . this may just something developers decided not i disagree , but it still seems little odd . note this really not detract game any way . xenosaga 2 , they also opted add lot more puzzle solving than episode 1 . interesting thing these puzzles , while challenging , don't take away gameplay expierience all . fact , i found many very enjoyable . storyline this game simply incredible . but , keep mind it basically required you beaten xenosaga episode 1 if you want understand it all , or least acquainted story some manner . if you haven't played it , best way get bonus dvd came game , there probably some somewhere around , maybe even ebay , allows you see 4 hours cut scenes original . this substitute those who dont want spend 60-80 hours required xenosaga episode 1 beat it . anyway , i digress , xenosaga 2 storyline more space opera fun . often times i got very emotional , game tug your heartstrings . ending sequence game , spectacular event lasting 15 minutes , i seriously tears . this game you , storyline good . it also filled entrigue , betrayal , new discoveries , new secrets . it truly incredible . i seen certain reviews say storyline doesn't solve everything , it doesn't solve all mysteries . let me tell you something : it not supposed . xenosaga going 4-8 part series , storyline continuous . it makes no sense all story complete only episode ii . i see no reason why anyone could possibly complain it . graphics : graphics xenosaga 2 basically same they episode 1 . no real improvements all . they still great though , cut scenes gorgeous . my one real complaint here lip sync sometimes off ( problem just every rpg voice overs ) , some environments little dull . this made up environments simply breathtaking . sound : soundtrack xenosaga episode 2 godlike . opening theme battle music catchy japanese sounding tunes ring your head forever , this music incredible . voice acting also absolutely superb , i zero complaints , this rarity . sound effects also very appropriate , very well . value : game hurt value department only because its length . put it perspective , first playthrough took me 28 hours , but more like 30 if you count all times i died go back point i got killed . after you win , you use your game clear file access even more goodies like some bonus bosses , dungeons , side quests , this helps make up shorter length . personally , i think its best $50 i ever spen t.t ilt : finally , overall enjoyment . this game simply most enjoyable game i played ps2 . i completed it after several all-night gaming sessions , it most likely keep you up too . role playing experience here superb , storyline possibly best rpg history , battle system incredible depth . there virtually nothing not like . avid rpg gamer , i recommend this game highly possible . however , there few things consider : you handle challenge , you like space opera/anime feel ? if you answered yes both , get this game	1
if you liked vice city , you'll love san andreas . more missions , car character customizations rival gang territories take over , what could better ? games biggest downfall familiar feeling you get after while , however , new improved options easily make it winner well worth cash . note , i no problems running this game pretty much all options high . i run dell 8300 3.0 ht , 1 gb ram , radeon 9700 pro it flies ! strap up get ready defend your ' hood	1
i decided try this game because it listed similar game customers purchased other games i really like . i am fan longest journey , syberia , gabriel knight , broken sword , etc . etc . i wasn't expecting whole lot when i started keepsake , but i looking kill time because i love pc games . very start , i swept into story , setting , characters ( i love it when there fun mascot sharing your adventures ! ) . voice-overs some graphics really pretty unrefined , but also makes game more endearing . these factors could reasons this game not listed way up there some other titles i mention . i added it my list favorite games , i play games alot	1

i wanted this workout " game " get back into shape after baby . it great workout including cardio , combat , isolation abs , arms or legs , mind body including yoga tai chi-type exercises . i love it tells you what day work out ( if you don't you fail day ! ) it increases intensity workouts based your previous performance . there several different workouts each segment so each workout truely unique help prevent burnout . your workouts assigned letter grade based your performance so it motivates me get allusive " " , which hard achieve ( it should ! ) . i am week 8 12 week program i definintely feel my muscles more toned firm after not working out year . i love nike helped produce game . i recommend this game anyone ; however , i issues eyetoy camera . you would think i would get how camera works after 8 weeks but i still problems . sometimes it indicates i touched something i nowhere near , sometimes it takes me 2 or 3 tries it register i touched something . you're still getting workout , but i'm working towards getting good letter grade . i want credit what i'm doing right . combat exercises frustrating i hard time believing i'm not punching hard enough often receive 0 score . i've started working out night sunlight windows makes camera less responsive . there couple times i've walked left screen my body triggered " try again " button after cardio workout ... so i 10 minute workout again history shown when i try exit out it , game fails me day quitting . all all i'm happy workouts , but just know camera takes some getting used . i hope others better luck it than i . my husband 12 week program also he lost 10 pounds i've lost 9	1
after sixteen long years , final fantasy iii finally sees official release outside japan . however , unlike previous games , final fantasy iii completely reworked . this more than just port enhanced graphics . final fantasy iii includes some new secrets side quests addition its graphical overhaul . final fantasy iii may just enough please some hardcore fans , but wait really worth it ? well , yes , but game isn't perfect . storyline final fantasy iii entirely too simple . crystals losing their powers there only four warriors come forth save world falling into darkness . sixteen years ago this pretty standard story , but when compared your average rpg today , current final fantasy games , storyline final fantasy iii joke . there nothing this story screams epic , characters involved aren't developed very well . luckily , we let it slide because its sixteen years old . gameplay wise , final fantasy iii pretty similar most rpgs today . you'll go roaming through dungeons towns getting into random battles . there few quirks game ds utilizes . you'll find moments where you'll zoom into certain objects you examine . it should also noted you use touch screen almost exclusively game . using stylus you make your character run direction you want him , gliding it across screen . taping things makes your character examine it , ultimately this how you open chests talk people . it works out , but it feels really clumbsy times . if you're looking get through dungeon little hassle , just stick directional buttons . its credit , though , using stylus makes menu navigation much faster , but most part , stylus controls just feel tacked . combat traditional turn based combat . there no atb gauge like later final fantasy games . each round you choose all commands your characters , then watch round battle take place . it simple , but isn't always fun . mainly because final fantasy iii challenge . if you began some later final fantasy games , then this installment may little too difficult . sometimes combat unforgiving , especially when faced bosses attack twice per turn , power take out character single shot . even worse , encounter rate pretty high running away battle often wasted effort because you'll fail so many times trying so . you'll probably get wiped out just trying run battle failing so many times . there several moments when you'll forced battle hours just leveling up . this fine those used old school rpgs , but many rpgs today not put so much emphasis leveling up , it may try your patience after while . it great people looking challenge , least , but some it may bit too steep . job system interesting . you go through game you'll get crystal shards allow your characters use certain jobs . each job its own set abilities learned it . example , white mages specialize healing arts , black mages attack magic red mages little bit both . you've also got other classes like warriors who take damage other party members , thieves who steal much more . there 23 jobs all , possibilities nearly endless . jobs you choose your characters also impact your stats . mages , example , don't lot strength but they excel magic . also , you gain levels , you'll also gain job levels . so it not only important make sure your characters good level , but also good job level . game looks absolutely stunning , least nintendo ds . it far one best looking out there . there some moments where it looks pixilated , but you can't deny game just looks good regardless . movie sequences also really pretty look they run surprisingly well . battle also fantastic . your enemies sport some amazing detail so backgrounds battle . whole , game just looks good . perhaps only fault graphics how restricted animation characters enemies combat . your characters won't physically go up strike enemy . rather they just step forward swing . very similar how final fantasy games nes worked . it strange see , but you'll quickly get used it . thing seems kind strange , though , top screen throughout most game remains blank . all action takes place bottom screen . there few moments when top screen actually displays anything . you'll see world map you travel overworld while you're towns . there certain moments where top screen text , or shows important story sequence , but that usually it . other than , when trumping through dungeons ( you often ) battle ( you also often ) top screen remains blank . there nothing wrong it , but it feels very awkward play nintendo ds game where top screen blank . they could've used it display dungeon maps or enemy information or something . top screen no impact gameplay whatsoever . music game pretty good , though . it not good other games series , there some tunes just aren't great , but music no means bad . there no voice acting game , really , but we let slide . audio wise , game good . final fantasy iii pretty satisfying experience any final fantasy fan looking good challenge , see how far series come . however , it may also shed little too much its old school charm some areas , particularly its unforgiving challenge . still , it worth it final fantasy fans who want see just how far series come . good+finally chance play final fantasy iii+great visual look+good music+the job system interesting+it provides good challenge+a fair amount secrets sidequeststhe bad-the story not all great-for some game might provide too much challenge , point frustration-high random encounter rate-throughout most your adventure top screen just ... blank ... nintendo ds game this just feels awkwar	1

i bought 2 these controllers my kids , because i didn't want cables middle our family room nor i want them sitting too close tv when they played . this controllers excellent . they work perfectly , they easy store because lack cables , weight fine small children , range signal more than enough they aren't battery eaters . i use them well they wonderful . they much better than ones comes playstations	1
santa brought this game , i don't think we've stopped playing since ! it such blast , really brings family together . we all so excited when my husband finally beat platinum " brick house " ( it our last one left wasn't platinum ) other day . it great variety songs ... new old . reviewer said there weren't enough new songs , i disagree . my friends ' daughters ( 21 16 ) even commented how many new ones there ( but they still chose sing " take me " 80 . my 8-year-old my husband gotten perfect scores " material girl . " fact , my daughter loves all old 80 tunes . only problem we've this game arrows don't show up dancing . we don't mat , but we tried it someone else house . anyway , i'm sure we'll get squared away time we get mat . i cannot recommend this game enough ! don't get headset , regular mics better ... sure get two duets	1
i played through fable lost chapters several times . all all , this very fun game . classic rpg elements leveling up , buying or finding new better weapons armor , choosing focus magic use or hack slash , choosing good or evil all included fable . graphics superb its time , voice acting top notch . addition , storyline quite good , more complex than average rpg ' save world ' tale . i heard some complaints fable too short , but if you take all quests max out all levels , game length should just fine ( unless you expecting 50+ hours morrowind experience ) . where fable loses some points controller setup . button configuration overwhelmingly complex , so much so finding yourself using item you not mean use frequent occurance . addition , you may find yourself using magic inopportune time , simply because you pressed trigger mistake . bow aiming feature might pop bad time ( like when you attacked 4 creatures ) , while rotating camera view , map pop-up might fill your screen you midst battle ( thus obscuring your view ) . also , fable tend some save problems . you may complete some quests save , upon reloading , quests may recompleted , or worse , may not saved not offered again ! still , these rather minor complaints . while fable really doesn't live up its advertising all-immersive rpg , it quite good , blast play if you like dd styled rpg . if you like zelda games but wish they more adult , definitely check out fable	1
headset awesome . fits very snug your ear not irritate over time . crystal clear 2.4 ghz channel . 9 hours game time only takes most , 1.5 hours charge . gaming lot more fun !	1
this game out while . i playing it long time now . i ever boring moment while playing gta : sa ? no ... i honestly cherished every moment gameplay . why ? because this game so much content capability , it not possible dislike this game if you actually sat down play appreciate it . people giving gta : sa low ratings must joking . control - superb . when i want my character something , he it , no questions asked . if i want fire gun enemy , i get fire gun without put up errors or jams . if i want hop car take off , i get just . content : this game vast improvement over even gta iii . there so much , it impossible ever get bored . every second entertaining ... there always something work and/or improve . challenging missions everywhere ; if you don't want missions you go lift weights , build up your muscles ... or you go put some neat features/colors your personal cars . radio : good stations songs cover just any genre . graphics : course there always room make graphics better , but graphics this game very good , despite there so much disk . this game covers everything , there never really let-down . if you haven't bought/played this game , i suggest you . it worth every penny , keep you entertained accumulated weeks time . good luck	1
it great game featuring awesome engine , single player campaign really good , multiplayer ok , totally recomended	1
this great controller , it rumbles ( unlike wireless one ) . yeah , it wear down time , but it far one better controllers because it doesn't ruin your gamecube it more durable third-party ones ( aka those not liscenced nintendo ) . i first third-party gcn controller some reason , it stopped my gamecube reading discs . i get it repaired . if anything , if you want good controller , don't go third party stuff . go original like this , one : they last much longer two , they don't ruin your hardware . it may look plain , but it would better plain working controller rather than quickly defective pretty one . also , official wireless if good , if you don't mind lack rumble	1
when blinx first came out , all reviews didn't really know what make it . they said this one most innovative titles come out past few years , but then they started going how hard it how it gets repetitive you go through each stage , clearing enemies proceed . well , what game isn't repetitive ? you could just easily say " all you tetris line up blocks " or " all you mario 64 collect stars " . reading time controls sounded so confusing . i didn't think i'd able handle 10 minute time limit each level while controlling time . so just week ago , i got blinx couldn't wait see how it played after countless " love it or hate it " reviews numerous people . after watching cool little intro breezing through first 2 worlds night , i saw -nothing- wrong this game . only people much trouble this those who only play rpgs or sports games , don't give platformers try . time control nothing worry either , it very simple understand , actually , you don't use time controls often . main story blinx short point . which good because i'm really sick games spending 15 minutes intros just tell you " this what going " pointless fmv . blinx quick 3-5 minute intro showing you he part millions time sweepers , time custodians clean up any problems time different planets . but suddenly , something goes wrong one them , princess kidnapped . blinx sees her gets determined save her , planet . you go through 9 worlds ( each world except last , there 3 levels , one shop , boss end ) get her back . each level , you collect time crystals gain time powers sweep ( use your sweeper/vaccum cleaner ) garbage take out all enemies level proceed next . it actually very fun i never got tired it . sweeping up different objects deals different damage enemies . garbage or flower pot won't whole lot , but beat up jaloppy , piano or even 16 ton weight , now there real damage . time crystals all over place , you gain time power collecting 3 or 4 same type . getting 3 one kind 1 any other gets you one power , but getting 4 same time crystal gets you two power . powers you use rewind , fast forward , pause , record slow motion , hearts gain you retry . if you haven't figured it out other reviews yet , it kind obvious when you need use some powers . like if you see bridge fall down , use rewind watch it rebuild itself cross . if you can't walk up river that pushing you back , rewind it so you walk up ease . if there two switches you need activate , record yourself jumping one while you jump other open door(s ) . main ones you'll using though pause slow motion , mostly because these work anything , even bosses . yeah , people go how hard bosses ... i guess they didn't figure out how use time powers . but last boss ... oh man . guy took me least total 9 hours beat . i just beat him this morning 2:59:49 am ( yes , i got exact second ) flipped out . i proud myself . he up there pocky rocky snes last boss . it like developers got mad something put all difficulty into him . because rest game pretty easy until part . side note , i love how ice levels actually ice . not magical non-slippery ice they other games . here , you pretty much skate floor if you go too fast or hit wall , you fall over get back up . it small things like make me love this game even more . graphically , blinx stunning most part . remember 10 years ago when you saw screens donkey kong country impressed models ? that what i got here . blinx himself some best graphics i've ever seen . see how he looks box ? that exactly how he looks in-game . you see fur him when he up close , they got every single detail down perfectly . every level also just much detail , there no bare areas all . there always something going . course , i can't leave out water . everyone seems impressed no matter what they think actual game . try slowing down time running through river/canal . or pausing it see trail left behind . developers fantastic job . unfortunately , some enemies don't much detail blinx . lot them just one colored shapes didn't really require much effort create . but then there some really cool design . so it little mixed bag there . last boss man , i won't even start thing . there no slowdown unless you're blasting tons garbage enemies without stopping . only other slowdown when you make it happen . it appears run 30 frames second , there nothing wrong . i really enjoyed music too , would love get soundtrack . main theme if fun enjoyable , first level contains most magical music i've ever heard . rest game good music , always fitting mood setting . final boss music really puts you mood take ' em out , it full energy concentration . sound effects cartoony , but that not bad thing . when blasting garbage enemy , you get zany little effect sounds like something tom jerry . voices however , i'm confused . they're not bad . fact , blinx great delivery voice acting not much personality ( he platformer character . he doesn't need personality ) . but i could've sworn they spoke japanese beginning . i know fact i translated some words meaning what text screen meant . but end , i didn't understand single thing . i guess they made up their own language here just like they panzer dragoon orta . but there isn't lot language going , just belts blinx most time . though he say some things english once while . i noticed " yay ! " " burned kitty food ! " when he got knocked out into lava pit . keep ear out what pigs say when you hit them garbage whenever they show up level . i swear one you fight most time goes " you suck ! " when he gets hit . it pretty intimidating hear even if you're winning . blinx didn't disappoint me all . it tons replay too . you get rank when you complete level , if you get all a+ or s+ ranks , you get cool treat . plus there cat medals each level add little bonus clips . first few pretty lame , but you get more , they turn out great . going back figuring out new ways beat bosses always fun too . i just can't stress how much i love this game . my shelf , i put this above knights old republic jet set radio future . but right behind panzer dragoon orta . what i've heard , demo sequel ( i'm amazed this thing well enough get sequel ) even better . blinx 2 probably first xbox game i get full price when it comes out . so get this if you're looking little bit " old school " feel superb graphics quality ... course fun . that all matters games , fun	1
basically if you like 04 , 05 06 you like this game nothing but rankings really changed . its same commentary , gameplay few new graphics . i like it its lot fun . im glad they didnt change it . remember old saying if it aint broke dont fix it . this great game play close there you ge	1
this game enjoyable enough , but doesn't really hold my interest enough go back it . it lags bit my gamer pc , some minor errors , but all aside , it just wasn't interesting me . game good quality , may perfect other gamers , so it still worth good rating	1
there really not much say this kit , however i think it unfair it received such poor rating considering only other reviewer complaint , kit too expensive , inaccurate because one he suggests actually more expensive . however , this truly passport amazing gaming experience . xbox live experience truly something innovative relaly really fun , i would recommend buying xbox 360 despite next playstation nintendo stations coming out . however , i also recommend waiting til after christmas . rush get these now ridiculous , i seen some consoles sell over 800 dollars . why not wait til after christmas when there almost certain price drop enjoy what this xbox live pack offer	1
star wars : jedi knight ii - jedi outcast . third game star wars dark forces series . introduction : i've pretty much always fan star wars , you may guessed , i'm fan many games based series . although star wars games often hit miss , when one succeeds , it usually succeeds beautifully . one most interesting ideas star wars game dark forces , released playstation one pc . although game itself horrendous , terribly-choppy framerate very poor level design , it something world never seen before - star wars first-person shooter . sequel , jedi knight , cleaned up lot problems , added some new innovations . now third game series , jedi outcast , arrived . like previous games this sub-series , it gotten multi-console release . read see how it fares ! overview : jedi outcast star wars first-person shooter . game one-player quest , well several different multiplayer modes . review : put it simply , this game everything original dark forces should . while not perfect , this game huge improvement over its predecessors . once again you play role kyle katarn , agent other dark forces titles . second death star destroyed , but many imperial forces still fight , so it up you infiltrate their hideouts exterminate them . graphics , most part , solid . i impressed how good they this kind game . nothing state-of-the-art , but they're still pretty damn good . control also given overhaul rightfully so , since this game lets you use force powers wield lightsaber . single-player mode extremely entertaining , fact game offers multiplayer options only adds overall value package . you save whenever you want single-player mode ! but , course , game isn't perfect . like earlier dark forces games , level design just not good . too many areas look alike , there too many instant death spots just too easy fall into . likewise , many cases your objectives unclear , some puzzles pain - i don't know you , but i buy first-person shooters shoot people , not solve puzzles ! because imbalanced puzzles often poor level design , it took me over hour just beat first level ! huge problem availability . lack custom control configuration also plagues game . this huge problem , since game limited control selections often clash what you're used this sort game . this game wasn't released gamecube very high quanitites , so you're gonna shell out full new price just get used copy - my mind , it not worth price . sad but true . i recommend this game star wars fans , just warned it not perfect , it hard get copy . edition notes : this good game , but some strange reason it just wasn't available gamecube very long . because this , even used copies fetch close original new retail price . this extremely annoying people like me who want get every star wars game . still , you should hunt it down if you're into this sort thing . overall : overall this best game dark forces sub-series thusfar . where game succeeds , it succeeds beautifully . i am impressed game , it just shame gamecube version not made readily available all would-be players . i strongly recommend this game if you get hold it - i doubt it disappoint any star wars fan .	1

this game great . both missions things you your own ( like extortion ) make this game awesome part anyone collection . i only found one thing wrong game . when you reach rank " don " , everyone still talks you i you bottom barrel . instance , when talking one corleone men , they still say something like , " hey kid stay outta trouble " . this game , although great , still use little fine tuning .	1

i using basic linksys wireless game adapter my 360 , it worked fine . however , it needed connected pc firmware updates ( making it impossible mac users ) , generally more difficult set up than " official " adapter microsoft . i ended up getting this adapter sale , setting it up snap . it gets decent throughput , saves some energy over external adapter , because it only uses power when you xbox 360 . it also nice see this supports wpa networks . if your time valuable you , this probably worth extra few dollars over similar products . you just snap it , enter your network password , you're off .	1

my kids really like memory cards because they keep playing there game once they get off andthey save it	1
i've counting down until i could get this release couldn't wait play all these great games again . when i got it started playing , it fun but disappointment kept mounting . little things like no manuals ( you open file and/or print them yourself ... not big deal itself , but come vivendi , quit so cheap ) no case cds ( you just get twopaper sleeves ) make package look incredibly cheap low quality . yes , these computer games 80s early 90s , but this package could put together better . graphics same originals , so i didn't expect any " update " there . i completed kq6 1 no problems , but kq5 annoying because you can't go back text ( or least , i haven't figured out how ) . " music " overpowers what characters saying . any problems you previous games , such difficult maneuvering , remain same , which expected . overall i guess my disappointment comes fact vivendi could made really nice package this , added some extras , beefed it up , included more information , stuff like . especially how long it took get this going . how many times release date pushed back ?? but no , it bare minimim cheapo production . i know it only $20 , but still ... could lot nicer . still must any kq fan tons fun play , but i am ultimately disappointed this product	1

i hesitated good while before picking this game up bargain price . based upon various reviews player feedback , i assumed this game would like 10 hours long , bit buggy , dumbed down . fortunately , none this case . i some good fun this over weekend ( yes , it finished over weekend ) didn't come across single bug . fable not same league morrowind , oblivion , gothic 2 , or some other great roleplaying games ( rpg ) out there , but it provide enjoyable diversion . gameplay : controls typical wasd keys mouse commands found most single-player rpgs . game fairly easy learn navigate . story traces hero childhood through adulthood , when he'll , you know , save world . there no character classes per se , but you roughly play warrior , magic-user , or stealth/archer character , or some mixture these . much story centers around main quest line , but there number side quests available . unlike most rpgs , quests assigned quest cards you pick up heroes guild ( lol ! that what it actually called ) . it rather artificial-feeling system , but it functional . progression game quite linear . most instances , you not able even leave beaten patch , since fences , rocks , invisible barriers won't allow it . compared more open-ended rpgs like elder scrolls series , fable seems restrictive light weight this regard . overall , it decent story , but it rather force-fed you . game includes several interesting touches . people react you based upon whether you've performed good or bad deeds . if you roleplay like saint , you'll eventually halo butterflies floating around . ladies ( guys ) worship you , you option buy home marry ( multiple times if you'd like ) . if you play evil character , you'll eventually grow horns fall out favor polite company . nonplayer characters game , least towns , jobs schedules . they work during day sleep night , though only quest-related characters anything say interest . although you only play game same guy , you customize him tattoos , facial hair , haircuts , ( small ) assortment armor . you control how your character skills develop , but not deeply you game like morrowind or baldur gate . there other small things you , such fish , play games chance , treasure hunt . overall , this game takes 20-25 hours everything it offer , so it rather short rpg . things i didn't much care not major , but simply underscore light-weight nature this particular game . game certainly designed appeal adolescent crowd , hotkeys burping , farting , so forth . various tattoo styles haircuts further highlight this point . there nothing really offensive game ; it just feels bit immature places . also , save system based mostly checkpoint model . you can't save just anywhere ( least your quest progress not save ) , but game autosave important junctures . graphics : game looks quite good . character models convincing ( though bit cartoonish often repeated ) , natural environment screenshot beautiful some places . since pathing fairly restrictive , much scenary noninteractive . it not like oblivion or gothic 2 , where if you see it then you probably travel it . sounds : voice acting pretty good , usual british accents invariably seem accompany such games . music particularly well appropriate various atmospheres . ambiant sounds also decent . replayability/technical issues : game probably worth playing twice : once good guy once bad guy . it play similarly either way , but there different ways perform certain quests depending your moral disposition . technically , game perfectly stable my computer -- no freezes , crashes , or other problems . manual decent explains much game , in-game tutorial . if you like rpg games get this one cheap , go it . it well-polished , though simple , rump through fairly well rendered world . don't expect same character depth , engrossing story , or exploring options you'll find some games i mentioned above . however , fable : lost chapters good several hours entertainment .	1

i rarely rate or write reviews video games , cds , or movies ... but i feel this game deserves all props it get . honestly when i first saw ad it i thought it looked interesting but none my friends or family heard it , so i reluctant buy first . however , my roomate i decided buy this game play it through together , it ended up even better than my favorite final fantasy video game series . sotc unique story line , decent music , but most all most beautiful innovative gameplay i encountered . idea just fighting giant creatures throughout free roaming world amazing , able climb up them use terrain best your advantage . no " trash mobs " each colossus relief too , because i feel though it would made game more cliche unenjoyable . i could talk all day this , but sake listening me rant ... go buy this gam	1
