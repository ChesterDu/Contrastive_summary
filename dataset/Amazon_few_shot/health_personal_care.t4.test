you could get same info " percentage " body fat going online . think it : how scale " measure " your body fat ? good question . so i went website manufacturer ... surprise , surprise ... there no details how this worked . it , however , note what it supposed detect how might connect body fat . scale supposedly measures something called " electrical impedence " which sounds pretty complex but really isn't all hard understand . all it means more fat you your body , more " impedence " you higher body fat reading . electricity doesn't flow well through fat scale supposed detect . but here catch - getting accurate body fat measurement not possibly just stepping scale , especially if consumer ( buyer ) scale doesn't understand factors vital accurate measurement . what you your body when you step scale one vital factor . here just one example how easy it would get bad reading : if you dehydrated not drinking enough water or , conversely , you overhydrated drinking too much water or you haven't measured your body fat within certain amount time after exercise or you've standing too long or you've eaten recently ..... you very likely get inaccurate reading you'll confused variation readings one day next , not knowing what factor or combination factors affecting your reading . even worse , you'll no real idea your body fat . what i've seen , these scales provide accurate weight measurements . but when it comes measuring body fat , ads or website not seem indicate you get inaccurate reading if you step scale wrong time day , too soon after exercising , if you thirsty , etc . so save your money . if you working out regularly , eating right , getting shape , etc .... odds your body fat dropping you'll see signs this . you don't need this scale prove it ( although you might consider it worthwhile discover your actual body fat some other way ) . signs reduced body fat firmer muscles , looser clothes ( often ) more streamlined figure . your metabolism likely more efficient , assuming you don't overeat too much . if you absolutely know your percentage body fat , just ask your local physician , trainer or gym director how get accurate assesment when so . if you workout regularly suggested or peak training level , your body fat should go down , assuming you don't compensate eating too much . so don't count this scale give you consistency or quality detailed controlled body fat measurement . it won't .	-1

you shave anything without putting future fatherhood risk , though it takes some patience get things really smooth . i've used it repeatedly over past three months without any major problems . my skin little sensitive after first time , but no terrible pain or anything , there none all now i'm accustomed using it . it possible nick yourself if you press too hard while shaving , but if you read instructions first you should fine . couple very minor drawbacks : it rather noisy , more so than regular electric razor , if you use comb attachments , it tough remove them without also removing foil screen same time . but pops right back , so not big dea	1

well , let face it .. short any procedure invasive(botox , cosmetic surgery , etc ) , there really isnt any magic cream going reverse aging process , but there number products aid improving look , feel texture your face . i've trying out several products out there , i found " olay total effects night firming cream face neck " one best ones around . i really like this one alot because many benefits it all one jar . after using it pretty generously little over month(i've used 1/2 jar so far ) , i found it worked wonders improving look feel my skin . it minimized appearance fine lines , really hydrated my dry skin , improving firmness , absorbed deep into my skin , so using it every night , i could still feel softness next morning , left my face feeling very smooth touch . i especially felt saw visable result around my neck throat area(where i am really starting get over 50 look ) . it nice , very light scent , here best part ... price here amazon 1/2 what i paid when i purchased it my groceries market(and it even sale store ) , so around twelve dollars here right now , it real bargain . there 7 benefits listed box , some i mentioned above , others include evening skin tone , minimizes appearance pores reduces appearance blotches age spots . give this one try any these aging signs . don't expect miracle . wrinkles not vanish , but nice improvement look feel your skin , healthy glow leaves you feeling just little better yourself(and great price ) . formula includes fast absorbing skin strengthener called vitaniacin(vit b3 , vit pro-vit b5 ) , wheat protein hydrators . i like it recommend it ..... laurie	1

i say i converted . over 15 years now i lived razor . i pretty thick beard it grows fast too . i am kind guy gets 5 o'clock shadow noon . i used every single type razor out there disposable battery operated vibrating type one blade 5+1 blade . i tried all brands ended up feeling gillette brand best type razor , but now i find it not best shave . i used electric shaver several years back , it one top line norelco incorporated gel . it gave me pretty bad razor burn not get all hairs ; i ended up shave normal . -- true story -- i am manager my job my last annual review only item i marked bad my personal appearance . not i dress bad or not wear deodorant , but they felt i didn't shave often . ( i shave very least every other day , usually every day ) . so i felt i so something it . i researched electric shavers thinking i could get quick shave during my lunch hour my car or least my way work so it would last longer . i found panasonic seems leading pack moderately priced all features expensive models . instruction manual explicit saying it take 30 days get used any new shaving method they assure you love panasonic shaver once your facial hairs get used way it cut . i using it almost 30 days now , i not live without it . i never this close shave before . i actually go 2 days without getting shadow . my fianc� found new love touching my face , i seem getting more kisses too ! during first 2 weeks i get couple missed hairs my old gillette , but today officially i able through my gillette away good . ( my boss even asked what i am doing different when i told him , he went out bought one too , he also loves it now . my fianc� said she would leave me if i stopped using panasonic , it good thing panasonic around decades ) so , i am raving his product , but every good its bad ... what bad ? well , it gets couple weeks get used shave , but amount time i am planning use it money i am saving buying razors every month , i handle . cleaning system very good , but it takes very long clean ( 2-3 hrs ) it noisy since base turns shaver off during cleaning cycles . cleaning cartage said last 3 months whether you use it once day or one week . i not gotten point yet , but it very very easy clean shower some body wash . i just end up using base drying cycle , which option . batter very good . month i used it , i charged it twice but it really didn't need it it said charge good . overall ... excellent product . could there better shaver out there , maybe , i ever know ... this time , i am not worried it , i am very satisfied this panasonic , don't think it get any better . this product not include cleaning base . i recommend it even if you don't use it clean razor , you use it dry it , it help keep your blades newest condition prevent them rusting when air drying . but , if you looking save money get excellent razor , this it !	1

i not buy this product amazon , but through retailer ( cheaper ) . i my research first came across all reviews this product amazon . since it less than $40 , i decided give it shot . i own this product roughly two months now . i am stationed overseas decided cough up $40 vs . $8 haircuts once week . it more than paid itself no time . i give myself simple haircut once week ( just one length throughout ) . some user comments amazon not affect me i felt compelled tell it : 1 . binding . just keep your hair short trim often it won't bind . what else you expect cordless trimmer . they not put out power compared corded electric one . even trimmer plugged , it still bind . i found this out very first time i used it . my hair 1 1/2 inches long . yes , it bind ( first time ) . after keeping my hair setting 8 ( roughly 1/4 inch ) , it not bind anymore . 2 . setting dial gets accidently turned . i never problem . besides , way i hold shaver my thumb permanently planted dial anyway so it prevent it turning . other reviewers who this problem may holding it wrong way . it require little finesse , but you'll get hang it second or third time . 3 . ease cleaning . description not lie when it says submersible . easy clean removable blades . water not affect this trimmer all . very good water-proof design panasonic . 4 . comes little oil bottle small brush . i clean thing every single time i use it so it ready go next time . just oil blades after every use ( panasonic recommended oiling before after ) . i found too much oil make it harder clean because hair sticks more water can't simply wash it out . 3 . overall this trimmer good go . save me lot $ during my 1 year deployment . plus good thing i don't wait line anymore get 5 minute haircut !!! hope this helps	1
after reading lot reviews here , i decided try this dryer . i dryer i love , but i thought i should try find back-up inevitable time when mine dies . one i vortex dryer(with bell shaped end ) lifts hair it dries wonderful ! anyway , i can't find same model , so i tried this revlon model . oh my ... i shoulder length color treated hair , kind medium thickness i ended up fuzzy mess ! i gave up before it quite dry went back my other dryer . i wish i would time start over , but i would late work . ugh .... hate bad hair day . thing .... on/off switch bad place . i kept turning it off i using it ! my thumb kept hitting switch . so .... its not me , but ymmv(your mileage may vary )	-1

i using various shavers over 40 years . i tried most major brands . past , i preferred remington because it powerful fast . but remington irritates my skin . braun less powerful less irritating , but still irritating . i previously used norelco rotary , perhaps 15 years ago , but it too slow not close enough . however , although most shavers remain pretty much same over years , this norelco giant step improved above prior models . it shaves faster , much easier clean . old norelco difficult clean . this shaver cleaned very well just hot water . however , i use soap lubricant . ( if you use oily stuff , marketed various pre-shaves , which basically puts film oil your face , there tendency gunk accumulate under blades . i recommend just using ordinary soap . ) this new model norelco larger blades , better shape , allowing closer faster shave . also , it much quieter than back forth models . think inefficiency ramming blades ordinary shaver back forth . rotary energy here more efficiently quietly goes shaving beard . i aged , my beard become less dense . if you tough beard , thick beard , you may prefer alternative . however , if you want close shave , quiet mechanism , which relatively easy clean , i recommend this norelco . you may not need well designed cleaning bay , may prefer just shaver charger . i hardly use cleaning system because just hot water works so well , using soap lubricant . interesting , brochure recommends just clean , dry face . i found soap works better . anyway , i would recommend this shaver one best available . long trial period suggests manufacturer own confidence its product	1

this great item . i purchased one each bathrooms my condo i love them . installation breeze , took all 5 minutes . plus directions give you option take out " low-flow " filter areas ( such area i live ) already low water pressure . old shower heads i didn't give me this option so i low water pressure plus low flow filters - which meant virtually trickle shower . so nice take real shower again !	1
some pens fat , some thin , most people preference . if you like fat pen , this handsome black-and-chrome item good candidate . it satisfyingly heavy reasonably wel balanced . i think cross great job satin black finishes generous chrome appointments give this pen bold appearance without becoming gauche . writing quality good , though you find better higher price . consider this pen audi a6 writing instruments , entry-level luxury may not compete mercedes but certainly fun drive	1
i can't use this bracelets , it makes them too big they slide off my wrist . also , clasp really heavy so if i use it necklace , it always hanging front , it not attractive . waste money , i never actually used it .	-1
i'm guy , this review coming guy point view . i absolutely loathe cleaning . i live studio apartment really shouldn't too hard clean , but it me becuase how much i love ie : hate ) cleaning . anything could make this easier great thing my opinion . so i got this magicreach kit , figuring it'd ok , maybe little better than my swiffer . i say i really like it . very simple , easy put togehter , overall just nice device . kit i got came mop pads tub tile pads . tub tile pads need moistened prior use then soap needs rinsed . mopping pads pre-moistened left dry . reading instructions helps you figure this out quickly , but i guess its easier skip step then get angry write one star reviews . maybe that more satisfying . its true mop pads drip few drops you put them device . somehow getting few drops cleaning solution surface you're mop doesn't seem like problem , but what i know ? i suppose those drops give away plan attack , taking away element surprise . my guess your dirt won't able run fast enough , even advance warning . if your dirt outrun you , then i suggest you find cleaner place live , consider changing few personal habits too . if you take few seconds read instructions use little brain power before using this thing i think you'll find you'll love this device	1

i experienced some tooth sensitivity this product , but much less than crest whitestrips . read other reviews - sensitivity vary person person . i like this product better than strips because it covers more teeth . no , it not cover all them - you would get zoom treatment your dentist or some other full treatment . however , this kit fast cheap . i noticed difference tooth color after using it twice two weeks . so , you may need buy multiple kits more effect . also , avoid getting it your gums rinse thoroughly after use . i burned my lower gumline little first time because i didn't wash it out well enough .	1
i purchased this shaver gift my husband he submitted following review : i older norelco not pivoting head extra shaving slots . i thought new shaver would one-up my older norelco so i ordered 9160xl . well , my opinion , there no difference quality shave nor reduction shaving time . so i returned shaver continue use my less featured , older model . i would , however , ordered very satisfied 9160xl if i didn't already norelco i feel it best electric shaver market --- i've tried most all them	1

there no 100% accurate scale . so you just get best one money . i've used different scales i'm happy taylor . i've seen this scale $50.00 most websites . i know lot people rated this scale kind poor . however , it not this scale only , all scales get rated poor . scale offensive object . it tells things people don't want know . people complain inaccuracy measuring fat . it approximate , all scales work same way . so wether you buy plus $100.00 scale , or this low price taylor , it same accuracy . one thing you got ask yourself although measuring fat approximate , approximate amount help you lose weight ? my answer would yes . so spend extra few dollars get fat analyzer scale . finding scale lifetime warranty very hard . scales wear out use , so i'm surprised this company offer . negative : it took me 10 minutes program scale reading instructions 4 times . so it not easiest instructions follow	1
