i agree person who said it hard chew here why . disect your slim jim length ways ... there , you see hair ? it ( allegedly ) all made cow hair ... gross ! beef part i guess . trans-fat ( partially hydrogenated veg oil ) some really long word chemicals make " mechanically separated " beef chicken what looks like hair taste " good " ? no thanks , glad i not buy 100 ! my dog really likes it but then again she eats other dog .. peewww !!!	-1
really strange cardboard mushy texture . flavor sickening times , but you get used it . i won't buy this again . i am not sure this even beef , strange taste . not sure where other reviews came ??	-1
i avid senseo fan year . however , i getting bit bored drinking same dark roast every morning ( i found other flavors too mild ) . so i very happy when i saw new flavors ( sumatra , colombia , kenya brazil ) . sumatra columbia two i liked . i found kenya blend mild sweet . even my wife , who previously used hazelnut not like it too much	-1
won't ship hawaii . hawaii state united states . some seem think it forign country . damn fools !	-1
way too sweet beef jerky . it similar drinking soda	-1
terribly waxy chocolate pieces all sunk bottom bowl while flakes floated top . flakes seem chocolate flavoring added enhance experience but those disgusting chocolate pieces made me gag i wondered what i eating ...! alone they nearly tasteless i'll never purchase again . yuck	-1
last time i order this sort thing online . i realize ' raisins ' first ingredient , but they weren't even * good * raisins , raisins outnumber everything else good margin . it basically raisin banana few other things thrown . coconut afterthought completely tasteless . sunflower seeds settled bottom . it edible , but it doesn't taste especially good ' tropical ' definitely misleading	-1
may expresso grind , but if you expecting lovely dark aromatic coffee your espresso maker : think again . bitter when drunk own . marginally better when combined milk cappuchino . i shoulda known betta	-1
it odd my taste buds reported me opposite reviews here . i'm disappointed , i paid this premium price based 5 star reviews . i'm old enough remember " old time " licorice sold 1 cent ( even 5 penny ) flavor consistancy i looking forward when i purchased this licorice . i some anise spice my cupboard baking , i just tasted it make sure i didn't my spices mixed up . based comparison ; my verdict this licorice tastes strongly anise ( not licorice ) . i thought it much too soft . there no " chew " it . it mushy . only thing i think compare it soft cheese , such havarti . it even softer than mild chedder . sorry ... only 2 stars me	-1
these apples coated sugar other gunk ( like sunflower oil ) which gives them strange taste . i very disappointed when i tried them . i wanting nice dried apples taste like apples instead oil , sugar preservatives . now i'm stuck two bags product not very good . i also got stuck dried strawberries which even worse . i not trying any more stoneridge orchard products . aware !!, these products cannot returned amazon so sure before you order	-1
my own fault not reading ingredients - but marketing info this product extremely misleading . basically , it $10 bag blueberry candy . high fructose corn syrup second ingredient - oil flavoring also added . i don't anything against candy but this stuff left my teeth tingling hours after i ate it - i actually brush my teeth twice . this product should not natural organic category - don't waste your money	-1
these far best tasting spirulina bars market . whole line more desert like concept , so course they sweet chewy . people ibs probably should not eat finely chopped raw nuts should read ingredients before buying !! food safe celiac , most food allergens ( again read label based your dietary situation ! )the bars travel very well although they may bend mush , because they naturally moist chewey , melting ? never . all bars this line travel great sit months hot or cold . these particularly good athletes people run . oh , price , come , there nothing else even comes close size quality	1
my whole family love these crackers . it nice they organic no artifical ingredients or hydrogenated oils . only thing i wish they whole grain !	1
i find this coffee very rich flavor yest strong enough my taste	1

i got into various oolong teas great new york importer . they really know their teas ! but this year , numi ti kuan yin available quality price bests experienced importer . i dunno , maybe they got lucky auction or somthing . but we've enjoying this tea ! you spend 3 times much get better tea . but then it too expensive drink every day . buy this	1
we first bought these crackers local store , loved them . nutritionwise they really good , great flavor oh so crunchy . never attempt conversation while partaking , you'll never hear other person :-) after our first purchase we bought directly dr kracker . then they told us great deal we'd get buying them thru amazon . that what we've doing ever since . aways good meals snack butter or peanut butter . then we'll something more substantial them our lunch time time	1
very nice wooden tea box . make nice present . i not tried teas , though	1
so these basically ritz bits , but three differences : 1 . crackers better ; they taste more buttery flavorful . 2 . cheese better ; it actually tastes like something that met cheese passing , maybe even shaken its hand . 3 . they're all organic ' ' stuff , so make you feel ever so slightly virtuous , less like slave big food . if you're packing lunches kids ( or snacks yourself ) , these great	1
i really like these they lot less sweet than other brands	1
mocha java almost good going starbucks cup coffee . i recommend it anyone who likes mocha flavor coffee	1
you can't tell this rice nooles . it tast just like regular pasta !! my celiac husband loves it he doens't feel like his missng out .	1
good texture , good taste ahi tuna . almost good beef jerky . avoid salmon jerky . most strips hard brittle . some so tough they barely edible ... more fit my dog . also salmon too spicy	1
they give 1% all profit off top charity activism . truly awesome company .	1
one reviewer writes these oreo crackers without creme -- they right ! these thin oreo crisp wafer type cookies nabisco easy pack when you're run just need quick sugar infusion . they also make snacking anytime day -- or night -- they give you great oreo taste without actually using creme ingredien t.t hese crackers cholesterol free trans fat free -- hooray ! there only 100 calories serving serving contains only two grams fat . they baked crackers which helps make them healthier than other snacking choices including greasy french fries . these crackers somehow manage give you full oreo taste experience while omitting creme fair amount calories , too . excellent ! these oreo thin crisps come six smaller packets which inside box you buy . this makes them even more portable both children adults . advantage cookies coming smaller packages inside box you know each packet pre-measured contain only 100 calories . this way you can't accidentally eat too many take more calories than you wanted . i notice these crackers made cocoa . please consult your doctor if you any concerns caffeine . chocolate cocoa could contain too much caffeine you if you sensitive . i recommend these crackers persons go who want quick snack . they should provide you sugar boost quick energy . they make healthier alternative other snack foods loaded fat and/or cholesterol . buy some enjoy them today ! smiles	1

these yummy vegan treats , but they kinda small 120 calories 4.5 grams fat . but they good snack	1
it so good taste popcorn tastes if it taken right out pot boiling water , buttered salted taste . smell corn cob runs throughout house . great summer smell all year long	1
these cookies not taste like they ever saw inside box . they taste like real butter fresh ingredients - they just melt your mouth . i'll buying these again	1

i'm french i love these galettes . they typical kind cookies you find brittany ( " bretagne " )with light salted butter taste .... i like tin too , you keep it store whatever you like ! make great gift french cookies lovers	1
these teas ( both raspberry blueberry ) priced lower than grocery store ( $3.49 per individual box ) , where they usually seasonal item . this frustrating since my husband i hooked them probably brew drink full pitcher per day . they best tasting cold ice teas great antioxidant benefits . this seller shipped them promptly they very well packed . we repeat buyer sure . a+ !!!!!!!!!!!	1
this dream ! quick-brew _and_ blueberry ! it slightly slower brewing than plain lipton quick-brew tea , but it brew up three minutes . it definitely blueberry flavored , it little red color . we impatient flavored tea lovers , this great product	1
i recently decided give these diedrich k-cups whirl . years , i've dedicated green mountain coffee roaster customer , their k-cup varieties excellent ; however , even their " cafe express " discount rate , their coffees more expensive several dollars per 25 count pack than current price amazon offering diedrich blends . i'd traveling southern california few months ago tried some diedrich coffees then . although coffees i tried tended exhibit starbucks/west coast tendency roast beans too darkly -- point effacing some original regional characteristics beans -- they fine dark roasts preferable what i've starbucks . coupled keurig brewer , this makes decent cup medium-to-dark " west coast " style coffee	1
if you ever mood summer sausage but don't feel like cutting piece off large log , these ticket . they great taste perfect snack ! highly recommended !	1
this best home style sushi kit . you get basics , excellent rice , sushi wrap sheets , soy sauce . i made these added thin sliced cucumber smoked salmon rolls i assembled them . best !!!! possibilities endless !!!! try it you'll see . sometime i all thumbs , but this very easy quality food excellent	1
thse best lollipops i ever tried- organic or not . flavors delicious , honestly . i would highly reccommend them anyone !	1
so delicious so healthy . fresh crunchy - much better than peanuts . i love these soy nuts	1
i love these crackers several reasons . they absoutely delicious , begin . they not use ingredients like " partially hydrogenated soybean oil . " they hard find stores . it hit or miss thing , here northeast . so i ordered amazon . propmpt delivery , ease purchasing keep me coming back	1
i love my coffee machine but i normally not buy t-discs gevalia due price . but found this amazon = wow 2 1 ! price great , even when you add any cost shipping etc . still beats " bead bath beyond " coupon ! service delivery excellent	1
i am addicted wasa crispbread multi-grain you too . very crisp hearty flavor . healthy product no saturated or trans fat . only 60 calories per portion . other wasa products also worth try - especially sesame	1
that all matters me . i can't always find it stock local store , i want my husband able enjoy it . i'm not real coffee drinker , but this kona blend seems lack bitterness first turned me off coffee years ago first place . so i enjoy some it too occasionally . , whatever blend he drinking , my husband likes millstone brand . i know it always smells wonderful	1
i very pleased these dried cherries . they delicious -- not too sweet , not too tart . healthy , too	1
nice flavor aroma . i like darker blends , this little light , but still flavorful .	1

i've eating cacoa nibs few years now other stores . this one just same quality 1/2 price elsewhere	1
if you ever trouble leg cramps , sure drink zico . it relieve your cramps almost instantly probably because it so high potassium . i recommended it others it always works . pat rampolla	1
these crackers best i've found , my husband tried them all . i'm organic nut i've slowly converting him conventional organic . i'll compromise , but he won't , so whatever organic products i give him good or better than what he accustomed , late july crackers fit bill	1
these wonderrful ! i get up real early when i get my breakfast all i grab one pour milk eat . no mesy bowls worry . 5 am morning great	1
it not get easier : become addictive so many only 25 min . away	1
i don't know how it someone took rice made it taste so good , but i eating these several months now . they extremely addictive . sometimes i find myself getting up middle night just eat them . not too sweet , no stomach reaction someone like me , who can't tolerate gluten . i tried all flavors , they equally satisfying . course , this processed food no live nutrients they say , but its only snack i eat really when i buy processed foods	1
like ingredients taste , it just little bit thick " flatbread "	1
some products better dozen , but i think i would rather opted variety pack if i buy 12-pack zataran . if you reading this review , then you probably already tried dirty rice , since you buy dozen packets it . so you already know it decent mix ( we add our own spices it give it even more kick ) .	1
i bought this add variety my diet , tried teff pudding recipe back - delicious , i think . my family didn't agree , but they like bread i made teff flour . hmm ... perhaps if i soaked grain overnight first , would make smoother pudding . try pudding , or add grain mix breakfast or side dish - it healthy it tastes good .	1
taste good spiced well , but it really dry hard .	1
these 1 " squares low fat sugar , so parents feel good serving them their kids . i wouldn't say they deep chocolately taste , but healthy snack they're pretty good	1
i just received my box sun crystals i not rave enough this product . i never tasted low calorie sweetener close flavor sugar my life . i am big time splenda fan , but this smoother taste it ... although not quite powerful splenda . i use 2 packets coffee normally it perfect amount sweetness without overpowering . using one packet tea just enough sweetness take bite off stronger teas , but not ruin flavor high end teas . all natural , i feel like it must healthier me my family than other low calories sweeteners . this only one i actually feel ok giving my children . i recommend this product highly anyone who uses low calories sweetener . don't forget type $5 discount code	1
spelt pretzels fiber hard come . organic boot ! my family used eat vita spelt until i realized there no fiber them they weren't organic . much cheaper amazon than whole foods	1
this cereal absolutely delicious ! it even tastes good if you eating it chips ! multibran high fiber content good your health , too	1
my search non-bitter ( stevia ) , non-artificial , non-refined sugar sweetner over last ! i hesitated buy this because requirement buy 12 . boy , am i glad i buy whole box ! we use this everything , including baking , find it really good taste . most sweetners ruin taste our fine coffees , but agave simply supplies sweetness . we'll trying amber agave next hopes heartier sweetness winter baked goods	1
after illy espresso bars italy , well , no other espresso tasted good me ! illy tastes great made good pump espresso machine . it also tastes great made steam espresso machine ( e.g. , low end krups ) moka ( italian poor-man espresso maker ) . rich flavor isn't burnt tasting like many espresso roasts . everyone i've made illy espresso raves over flavor compard espresso chain coffee stores . tip when brewing espresso using steam espresso machine : shut off valve before any steaem comes through coffee . high temperature steam leach unwanted flavors into coffee . i used buy illy local stores , but prices over $11 per , sometimes $12 . i happy see amazon start carrying it even lower price . if you can't find illy good runner-up lavazza , however , its flavor isn't intense illy	1
we love these crackers . my kids all eat them , i keep bunch my backpack emergencies . they crunchy nice aftertaste . they smell really good too	1
great product --- what else i say ? while i lived caribbean , i ordered food since it too expensive buy good quality food there	1
weird after taste but over all it good way better than even diet soda no sodium . i'm not sure what previous rater talking i read all ingredients soda my book usally mean it all natural ingredents . already bought couple different flavors tr	1
this best jerky world !!! sooo good . juicy flavor . i eat it all one day . all gone !! spices kinda hert comin out though	1
i order several bags this hot spicy . it grit texture like it sand it . i wrote company found out some bags manufactured larger grain sugar than they intended . this caused grit texture . they sent me replacement bags , replacements wonderful . excellent flavor texture . give them second chance	1
my all-time favorite flavor pop-tart , but no stores my area it . thank you amazon !!!	1
baxters soups usually very nice , but lobster bisque especially good . it tastes authentic , it good flavour , creamy , just enough lobster bits make it interesting . add some fresh black pepper dash brandy or sherry it rivals soup served very good restaurant . it also surprisingly low calorie . though nutrition info here says 130 calories 8oz , label actually says 120 calories , so even if you ate whole lunch you would consume only 220 calories	1
unlike other reviewers , i not like fruit rollups or leathery fruit bars any kind . these bars soft chewy very satisfying . they great snack keep handy . i would highly recommend , especially if you person who doesn't usually like other types fruit leathers , sticks , rollups , etc	1
i like way this tastes , but it not fantastic . it fills you up ( fiber expands ) keeps you regular . honestly 2/3 cup your set breakfast . i don't know what wrong last guy who posted . i'm pretty sure he some dude who thought it would funny write post some old guy unfortunate run bran . nothing goes through you fast . bran not laxative . its bulk forming fiber . i wouldn't really care except this good product	1
this keeper . best i found , so far . light airy . make peanut butter jelly sandwiches .. doesn't need toasted like others ... makes " mean " french toast ... my daughter ( who pretty picky ) eats this bread lot .	1
i loved blueberries raspberries , but not cherries . i thought fruit ( all types ) bit too sweet . they added lot sugar it . otherwise , it healty snack	1
love these granola bars . they healthy you don't force your children eat them . these two very good reasons buy them	1
not most economical way buy this , but packets convenient cheesy garlic delicious without overpowering	1
if you like peppermint then you love this tea . it one celestial seasoning superb products . very warming relaxing	1
ok , i'm eating this stuff , i don't eat cereal . what tell you ? it tells you it pretty good . it organic , so i tell myself i am helping out my body eating it ( which probably not true . ) $3 per box delivered , i don't think i'd buy this , but amazon deal i got them $2 each , now i am considering loading bazillion ' em . this prime member find . maybe i'll mix rest flavors , 6 boxes time . comes $ . 40 per bowl , not counting milk half banana	1
they great , my groom huge cashew fan my mom both more than pleased . they not heavily salted all , we pleasantly surprised , salt more fine powder than what you would expect salted product . they always live upto best peanuts va , we send them people all over country they all hooked	1
my kids(3 4 years old ) just got finished this lunch , i say it instant hit ! they loved rolling their own sushi . i few rolls too , it very tasty . i ordered this whim when it " gold box " special , i am so glad i	1
i love these filling snack . they also satisfying if you craving something crunchy . i keep few bags my car trip home work or if i am running late morning can't get breakfast . they also nice flavor , really natural not artificial tasting	1
i buy baxter soups case because i am disabled can't get grocery store . these soups restaurant quality dollop sour cream , you real treat . smooth velvet , they you either gulping them down wanting more or savoring every spoonful	1

i wasn't sure this tea first because i tried several other teas contained licorice just too sweet me . however , i'm pleasantly surprized light , tangy flavor this tea . sweetness there , but it not overwhelming . i'm not certain it much me relation " detox , " but i certainly like taste , especially after lunch . it seems settle my stomach help me digest	1
these crackers bes t-t asting saltines we've ever . we love them ! they light , not too salty , delicate smattering olive oil . ingredient list short -- only four items ! i buy them case our family four they don't stick around long enough get stale . they great take party if you're serving crackers cheese . i strongly recommend them .	1
if you judge this snack packaging , you might never try them . baked pea pods don't exactly sound like most appetizing ( or satisfying ) snack , but these guys really deliver . one other reviewers said , they crunchy light , texture similar cheetos , possibly little more dense . they taste lightly salted snow peas , only light airy . while they might not healthy raw or steamed vegetable , they're good alternative if you don't want all chemicals sugars most packaged snacks . these guys no sugar all ingredient list wholly recognizable . i usually buy two bags time because they tend go so fast . both flavors delicious , though i prefer original . since it appears amazon no longer carrying them , you might try wild oats , trader joes or whole foods , if any those nearby	1
" cubicle commando " pringles often find their way into my bottom left drawer . they staple food this environment . i suspect dibert would derive almost 30% his nutrients these ! i love pringles ! however , i've come conclusion i need buy them traditional tube because whenever i buy them " convenient " snak pack , i'm lucky get half them aren't broken or crumbled . what point pringles if you can't eat then whole ? packaging makes difference . maybe you'll better luck than me , but my take it	1
