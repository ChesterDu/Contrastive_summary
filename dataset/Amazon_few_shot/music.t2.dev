this one most dissappointing debut albums come out mid nineties g-funk heyday . warren . didn't even produce one song this sorry attempt making hard/soft gangsta rap except title track already used his album year before . skits ridiculous , music halfass , lyrics amateur . there absolutely nothing keeps listener attention whole album . this similar other west coast rap albums play it too safe such w.c. madd circle debut coolio " it takes thief " . one star hit single " summertime l.b.c. " .	-1
this cd worst " comedy " cd i ever heard . yet reviews here mostly claim it hilarious ???? ok , i've come conclusion , only people writing positive reviews amazon must people trying sell junk . i've seen this guy some tv shows , comedy central , he somewhat funny guy , but it painful listen this cd . you feel awkwardness crowd , not knowing if or when laugh . it continues throughout entire cd . there don't seem any jokes cd all . it all disconnected negative rants bitter angry human . don't believe me ? then go ahead waste your money this horrible piece junk , see yourself . like my review title says , not read positive reviews . just read negative ones , decide how credible they seem . then make your decision buy or not buy	-1

my wife got this cd me because i like music movie cast away . she saw words quot ; cast awayquot ; large prominent print . she saw picture tom hanks , very large . she assumed it soundtrack movie not just 10th track 10 cd . hindsight she should read entire panel cd . i guess producers this cd didn't think rest music could stand its own so they deceptively packaged it this way figuring most people wouldn't waste time returning it . if you it listed rate column , i would give it negative rating instead just one star	-1

band , byrds one greatest certainly one most influential bands rock roll history . adding legacy , " mr. tamborine man " status one greatest debut albums rock history almost without question . this band could it all ; country , folk , rock , jam , psychedelica , etc , etc . this debut perhaps pinnacle their achievements . though they would venture into much more adventurous territory ( " notorious byrd brothers " ) , this where band most solid , most tight collectively . dylan influence everywhere get-go ; 4 his songs span album , including title track which byrd turned into his only #1 hit . elsewhere , there two other covers , but songs best longevity originals , mostly penned gene clark . witness tortured romance " i'll feel whole lot better " " here without you " tell me he wasn't great songwriter . roger mcguinn ( or jim , if you like ) quick finding his signature nasally croon would go influence tom petty , among others . obviously , not everyone found their place ; songs chris hillman david crosby nowhere found . but " mr. tamborine man " stand today every bit tall early works dylan beatles . this album set standard folk-rock then , buffalo springfield rem toad wet sprocket most current emo bands . overall : 10 out 10	1

my only real frame reference movie sinatra brando . maybe not best campare , even so i say , exception nathan lane faith prince , performances cd lacked life i would expected . maybe it effect he going suave , worldly gambler , but peter gallagher sky masterson just came across bored . his voice also not quality i would expected broadway-caliber performer . i almost hate admit it , but i even prefer brando rendition " luck lady " over one this cd . movie version " sit down , you're rockin ' boat " also far superior . some " sky " songs ( complete songs , not snippets/samples ) also found peter gallagher web site . i found cd my local library , so i avoided pay disappointment . i would recommend you try borrow copy before deciding whether it actually worth buying	1
this impressive effort . this cd played fairly constantly my car past 3 weeks . what impresses me i consistently find new bits stand out depending my mood . there some great grooves , brilliant fills , rocking riffs classic eric johnson style first movement , ' prelude ' . opener ' bloom ' ' good me ' probably highlights there . mr. johnson then turns it down bit during ' courante ' , second movement . ' sad legacy ' ' my heart ' both great introspective songs . ' sad legacy ' builds sense urgency ' my heart ' mellower , rb feel nice jazzy runs . these two probably my favorites off album . last movement , ' allemande ' starts off nice old-school style jazzy number , ' hesistant ' . ' magnetized ' gets things rocking again , before very good atmospheric classical guitar piece , ' ciel ' ends ride . eric plays wide variety styles this release manages keep it all together one cohesive piece , one small exception . tribute jerry reed , while nice bit picking doesn't fit this cd me , especially after sitar ' cruise nile ' . i'd recommend this cd anyone who enjoyed ah via musicom or venus isle . or , if you aren't familiar eric johnson already , then yourself favor pick up cd . this one good any his studio albums start off .	1
i fan sting ever since i college . i actually got see him person late 80 . i just every cd he ever put out so when this one i ran right out bought it . every song it great it one my most favorite cd i own .	1
this actually first lp album i ever bought over thirty years ago . i listened it again after very long time when this remastered version released . i think some hype said this album way overblown , although it very good record one seventies most notable also-rans . some ian hunter dylanesque dylanisms overly dylany , " ballad mott " " i wish i your mother " , but overall strength songwriting outweighs his croaking out his sometimes clumsy lyrics . worth owning immortal " all way memphis " alone , but rest album fun ride .	1

let me start saying after endless exposure karl jenkins ' most famous work ( " diamond forever " commercial theme ) , i doubted i'd ever like anything he wrote . i am glad say i mistaken . jenkins ' requiem without question modern work , although its mold probably bit closer britten war requiem , or even herbert howells ' " hymnus paradisi " , than other modern requiems , such those faur , durufl , or rutter . jenkins ' use haikus japanese -- his intertwining haikus text near end -- add extra dimension work , even though those movements substantially different sound than rest work . even " dies irae , " its unusual orchestration ( i won't spoil surprise ) , success . fact there no well-known names here doesn't matter ; orchestral choral sounds both excellent . better still , rather than making this sole work cd , emi adds " these stones horizons sing , " work sung partly welsh , which rounds out this disc more marvelous melodies , particular , ending third track , " gray " . [ please note track listing above incorrect . ] fans jenkins ' music definitely want this disc . i look forward hearing more his music myself	1
this album , several jarrett other albums completely improvised . you imagine how difficult it must just sit down piano play 26 minutes render something this exceptional ? problem some reviewers casting negative comments based repetitiveness absurd . many parts this work not even melodic . i highly recommend i 0:00 - 16:00 , iia , iic . there many parts these works melodic -not- repetitive . trick this sort improvisational music transitions . jarrett able create logical transitions sometimes flounder bit ... you think , " oh boy , i think he lost it here ... " then he starts something completely new rescues piece , blazes new trail , but still succeeds maintaining original thematic element or melody piece . i literally probably listened i 100 times , i learn something new every time . it actually possible sit down piano play some song ear , except crazy runs here there . i've read this bestselling all jarrett work , it easy see why . you imagine stepping into concert hall koln germany one night , not any idea what this pianist going play or if you invested your money well ticket ? no idea what he going play . yet he pounds out this collection music ? this type improvisation what i would liken impressionistic art . when you try paint photorealistically , you stay lines copy something exactly ; just classical or some jazz music . this album collection notes splashed canvas order unplanned , chaotic , -beautiful- .	1
human beings this wonderful opportunity because suffering . instead constantly resisting dissatisfaction , trying sweep it under carpet or lament grieve it pained it , we should grateful it . it our very best teacher . ~ ayya khemathe soundtrack elements wicked sense humor darker elements plot , like suddenly first track ; playful music stops scratch record turns more ominous . times music lullaby qualities or mood child room music box playing background . sense peace quiet presents moments great beauty , but there always ominous element lurking beneath notes waiting create those nagging feelings doubt . reptile room track beautiful exotic , while unpleasant incident track sounds like track horror movie or someone running danger . you may start see movie running through your mind various points even if you only seen it once . sheer cacophony some pieces takes angst entire new levels . it all quite wonderful if you enjoyed movie you might enjoy soundtrack its own even more . ~ therebeccareview.com	1

his unique blend folk , bluegrass americana very soothing . some his song titles kind strange , but when you listen actual songs they all make sense . he one my new favorite artists . i like him because he his own signature sound . music today all phoney bands carbon copies . banjo interesting sound , i never really listened it other albums before listening this album . i don't see this music mainstreram , but thats whats so good it , hopefully it never get played out loose it indie charm	1
arguably their greatest album ever . it so many different musical styles it unbelieveble . many consider check your head better effort but this good they ever go t.t his album gets my personal vote best album 1994	1

clapton god : this grafitti time . no other guitar player called god ... except maybe jimi hendrix ... importance record , reviewer chuck voellinger says it all . anyone who ever laid hands guitar should study this record first . it essential , although i think album layla clapton his best ever .	1
i little suspicious ensemble so hiply marketed boac , but this really enjoyable recording beautiful piece riley . it striking think while europeans producing such moving ( often beautiful ) pieces angst alienation , horror war-weary self-loathing , riley came up this piece so inventive yet so sunny simply beautiful . easy connections glass reich , course , but it also reminds me various kronos quartet recordings ( oddly ) mccartney experiments sound textures fireman : rushes . recommended curious those arriving contemporary chamber orchestral music way pop rock	1
i made my way sufjan stevens way iron wine . this cd suggested me friend , i must say it some most hauntingly beautiful songs i've heard quite while . i am not big fan sufjan newer work , which evidently puts me minority . i wish he wouldn't abandoned intimate , acoustic style dominates seven swans . he lot say , says it very well just acoustic guitar minimal arrangements . i would suggest this cd anyone who enjoys artists such iron wine , elliot smith , or . ward ...... good acoustic guitar , strong songs , lyrics go beyond jack johnson 5th grade drible . i only hope sufjan makes his way back this style , least once while .	1
i honest . first time i heard they're only chasing safety , i only liked one song , i said myself , this screamo crap , it all felt like it same . only song i liked boy brushed red ; it . some reason i started listening it again , some point album just clicked me . i started like more songs each time i listened it . me least , when i actually listened it open mind , i found something amazing something i missed before . this album just pure engergy . its not best album ever made , its not groundbreaking or totally original , nor it music look deeply analyze . what it tho , crack music form . its full energy , catchy hooks , great riffs , raw power emotion . believe me , this energy music if there ever any . it pumps me up , i love listening it my car . it music you just feel , you don't think it . it really gets under your skin you can't stop listening it . you give album credit when it you . kudos . i havn't got sick it yet , so says something it well . i'm not really into hardcore/screamo , but this really well record , it hit you hard . believe me	1

owned this album well over two years i figured it time finally write review . if you don't know who dave attell , you must living under really big rock or don't cable ... which i guess same thing . attell portly alcoholic host comedy central ' insomniac ' also one , if not , funniest standup comics working scene today . now , dave attell isn't really everyone . some people some reason feel need politically correct attell most definitely not pc . his humor somewhat focused following topics : poop , midgets , ugly women , alcohol , sex , child abuse , homophobia . covers it . he not political . he not trying make any social statements . he just very funny(and vulgar)comic who timing , delivery , subject matter make you crap your pants laughter . ' skanks ... ' flat-out single best comedy album ever released . it simply hilarious beginning end . attell riffs how defensive women , his midget buddy , getting lonely bug personal favorites . but entire album consistently hilarious . go buy it right now . man brilliant you won't disappointed . i've listening it over two years its still funny . i'm just waiting second album ..	1

" neruda " one most creative interesting albums released 2004 . among other questions , it raised this one : what luciana souza possibly encore ? same question raised 1969 who " tommy " , first popular " rock opera . " encore , course , consisted who going back its roots one greatest rock albums ever recorded , " who next . " , same way , luciana souza gone back her roots this , her second album brazilian duets various brazilian guitarists . like " who next " , this one not disappoin t.t his album recorded ms. souza ( sans percussion , voice only ) four guitarists : romero lubambo , marco pereira , swami , jr. ( yep , that his name , fellow americans ) guilherme monteiro . every cut sounds heavenly . this album remind you laurindo almeida astrud gilberto , only it better -- basically because ms. souza far superior singer , imo . special note four tracks . " trocando en mudos " same sense longing desire permeated " neruda " disc . but lest you think ms. souza only " moody " , listen how she clips guitarists " sambadalu ( para luciana souza ) " " chorino pra ele . " ( fact , great vocal exercise vocal jazz ensemble would all singers double try keep up ms. souza latter ! )and then there last track , " voce . " rather than acoustic , mr. monteiro swithces electric guitar , pedals , creates this vast , open sound similar creations bill frisell or ben monder . vocalization it tremendous . terrific end terrific album . highly recommended .	1
i over 50 boxed sets , far this best packaged i ever seen . i shown all my friends all very impressed . it comes conventional sized women hat box carrying rope . you remove lid open box , 4 cd individual cardboard cd cases centered box black felt cardboard material filling round box . round lid listings songs artists , top 4 cd 200 page booklet pertinent information each artist song . there pictures almost every artist , well pictures original 45 labels . bios artists songs informational entertaining . each cd many familiar songs many never heard before , including songs big name artists released before they became successful . 2 examples : song cher , written sonny , released 2 years before they released " i got you babe . " pop song released 1964 dolly parton before she became country star . there 120 songs 4 cd most ignored totally radio . there only one song out 120 i absolutely hated ; rest not only listenable , but most cases very good excellent . this definitely worthwhile purchase if you're into sixties music .	1

although i loved-loved clash ( saw them ' 82 ) , i admit , after initial brief orientation joe strummer solo work mid ' 90 , i mistakenly put him aside . big mistake . then , joe tragically died few years back . year ago i friend place party i caught music playing , which sounded like joe voice but music so friggin ' hip sounding . wow !, i said when i told it joe strummer mescaleros . much music connaisseur i am , point i felt very inadequate . then , streetcore , x-ray , go-go permanent staples my cd player . remarkable thing they never get played out no matter how many times i hear them . combination acoustic electronic instruments punk style vocals various rhythms beats greatest thing i've ever , ever heard last , oh , 20 years . i get little older , i welcome mellower sounding music , especially if it punk soul great lyrics . streetcore other mescalero recordings best both worlds also totally versatile . they good parties , chilling out , driving , cleaning house , or just spacing out . i typically give cd i like 5 star ratings . well global go-go , rock art x-ray style , streetcore , all masterpieces music deserve their own category beyond ratings . rip joe . this music never die .	1

catherine wheel ( ) one my favorite bands , so i'd like guide new listeners toward what i consider their greatest album ( despite opinions certain ferment fans this forum ) -- chrome . best songs chrome ( particular , " broken head " " pain " ) reach absolute pinnacle " shoegazer , " known its sensuous walls atmosphere derived primarily mutated guitar textures . ferment contain cw signature song blueprint things come , " black metallic , " worthy underground hit still one their best songs ever . but most other songs this cd not represent their best songwriting , perfectly honest . while " i want touch you " " she my friend " good songs , " shoegaze " sound underdeveloped these tracks it most ferment . i consider ferment evolutionary step toward majestic brilliance chrome ( see my review , if you so choose ) , not good but still worthy addition my cd collection , considered whole , more consistent album than chrome . however , you should note my opinion may rather unorthodox according your typical cw acolyte . unorthodox view : i like actual songs happy days more than ones ferment ( overall ) even though they largely abandoned shoegazer sound happy days . therefore , you might want take my opinion grain salt ( you should all opinions , really ) . .	1
dance styles combined flirty overflowing empowering " filled attitude " lyrics make this total smash ! when listening this album , there no moments feeling down since confidence shines throughout ! soulful singing , back disco sounds , musical accompaniment make this more than pleasurable experience . above all , tracks get one feeling liberated , free , happy take anything . overall , there great dance beats , catchy hooks , positive vibes , much more enjoy ! words , melodic dance beats , romantic moments cause empathy many who through spiraling roller coaster vast lovers . while long ride journey wild tough , songs prove you what your experiences make you : special hot ! there many excellent selections take pleasure but among top songs recognized hot dance club singles " don't cha " ( featuring busta rhymes ) , " beep " ( featuring will.i.am ) catchy " wait minute " ( featuring timbaland ) . aside those excellent songs , my other favorites would " i don't need man " attitude lyrics souful singing , " hot stuff ( i want you back ) " since it reminds me disco donna summer days , " tainted love/where our love go " " bite dust " fast paced , energetic dance styles .	1

hey , i love west coast , well california ( hope live there one day ) . i believe they come most creative hip hop game , try support anything they . but you not know how mad i am this album ! when i heard dogg pound comming new album , i couldn't wait cop it , because comming some veterans west coast ( my favorites i might add ) , i high expectations this . this very dissapointing album . i guess flaws right my face . i really don't want accept fact west coast fell off , i keep beliving they're going get back their feet , but this keeps sending me few steps backwards . basically spotlight reviewer " constant " made perfect statement this album . this trio rhymes skills kinda bad lately like song " sittin 23 " . it like each member tries rhyme , they okay some points , but fail most time . songs like " hard hoe " " fake***hoes " just horrible . album name " cali iz active " you'd think they would bring many west coast artists this album , but they didn't . lady rage , rbx , nate dogg , ice cube appear this , but fact david banner , . diddy , pall wall this damages albums image . also many reviewers stated , they're rhyme style hasn't really changed since 1992 . now thats huge problem . there some good tracks this here , when i say " good " , i mean they barely pass listenable . i believe self titled track " cali iz active " good one well how they brought all artists west video shoot , i hoped it would like album . although many beats not west coast like , they still little nodding like " keep it gangsta " although lady rage outshines kurupt daz . " it all hood " one those " good " songs here ( i meantioned what i meant " good " ) . overall , this not good album . me this huge dissapointment . i denied my self kept believing this good album , but i heard it over over again , it got worse worse . if anyone remembers when west top rap game , knows this not way you bring it back . new listeners , who unfamiliar it domination might like this album . i can't accept this all . lyrics : cproduction : c-guest appearances : c-musical vibes : doverall : c-favorite tracks : cali iz active , slow your roll , don't sweat it , honorable mention tracks : keep it gangsta , throwin up da	1
i just love lead guitar work " desolation row .

" like rolling stone " rocker extrodinaire it goes six minutes , which big deal when it came out , because most hit records never when over something like three minutes , ten seconds . dylan really broke mold " stone " , opened up scene others record long songs . this super cd . one you just own	1

i admit , i am very sceptical some music when i first heard goo goo dolls i thought what sissy name laughed . wow i wrong thinking . i love goo goo dolls their music . dizzy up girl my favorite ggd cd . my 3 favorite songs dizzy up girl , what great fast paced song keeps you moving through whole song , slide iris , which my favorite song whole cd . very mellow track it very relaxing . give this cd try you not dissapointed	1
i opportunity get early glimpse cd found it fairly good session . i say because it not gerald best work , but definitely not his worst . i am true fan gerald music eagerly wait anticipation each release which seems come every two years after several years back back projects . what you like this project title track `new beginnings ' featuring patrice rushen which brings back fond old school memories grover washington jr. also , `last but not least ' catchy beat you tapping your feet ( i see this one getting some radio air time ) . but gerald really shows his sax ability his rendition `georgia my mind ' . `i need you ' `all love ' puts little modern day vocalize rhythm cd . he gets somewhat funky `big shoes ' `we got groove ' which turned out quite enjoyable deserves radio air time . other selections ok best . cd good mix , good enough add your collection , but if you looking " live birdland west ' you may wait couple more years . ~ jazzeone	1
i pleasantly surprised how good this album . every song its own hook , its own sound . not all songs fast hard ( although ones , good ) . good melodies impassioned singing . one best albums early ' 80s	1
soundgarden my favourite band but i never decide what my favourite soundgarden album it really just depends my mood but non soundgarden lovers it probably depends more your taste music because each soundgardens albums very different . if you like heavy dirty grunge you'll like this album , something cleaner more arty superunknown , something more 80 ultramega ok or louder than love summer psychedelic feel get down upside . every soundgarden album great so get them all because you can't judge them one album	1

i am huge fan psychedelic furs early work . i believe sleep comes down , love my way sister europe absoletly flawless . despite brilliant musicianship unique lyrics dark , brooding cinematic feel , reall draw furs best work richard butler inspired rasp . many compared him bowie , indeed two men share some vocal similarities . however , while mr. bowie unafraid jump latest production trend or bandwagon when it comes his latter day records ( few early ones ) butler pretty much stuck his guns far guitar , bass , drum , keyboard configuration his output . all changed , what change it ! glorious atmospherics mixed his usual brooding lyrics order day . but wait , high end register his voice ? rasp buried underneath sweet , almost plaintif vulnerable lilt ? who this creature where he hiding so many years . standout album one modern musics most influential under-appreciated singers . but whole album - every track standout !	1
i've reading over reviews , i'd say most them completely miss point . i don't think too many people buying this album care whether these songs pieces musical genius or not , they're meant entertaining kids ( kidz even title ) . if you're going complain who they get sing these songs i'd say you're probably already over age range this album targeting . play this kids , they'll love it . they able dance sing , both which great because we should getting our kids interested music . furthermore , you don't need go scavenging clean versions everything or pay bunch money tons albums . now all you older people , unless you're idea great musical talent what found radio today , then i'd call these better than originals ! let face it , most stuff radio joke ... really these kids terrible singers ( they're mostly shouting ... just like all kids ) . so i'd say they're making songs originally bad worse funny . which much more entertaining than just bad . :	1
new punk rocker peter hayes now rich , thanks dude brian jonestown massacre who hooked him up brmc !!!! what great transition hayes !! now he leads way !!! brmc writes catchy , fuzz-scratched rockers get people jumpin ' clubs . suits industry like these guys cuz they sell records truckload , but kids like brmc more pure reasons - namely , da music !!!! if you like warhols you'll also dig brmc - it deal !!!!!!!!!!!	-1

i'm sure there very little i say this double album hasn't already said . this pure masterepiece -- elton john his absolute best . elton 40 some lp releases over past 37 years , goodbye yellow brick road his top work my opinion . there some come close -- madman across water , honky chateu , rock westies come mind -- but they can't quite touch this gem . songs here not only musical but visual -- if crating movie blind . list song titles here incredible . it basically consist who who elton john songs . many familiar funeral friend/love lies bleeding , benny jets , harmony , candle wind , title track . there also wonderful lesser known songs . one which comes mind funky rocker , dirty little girl -- one my favorites years . if you could own no other elton john album , this would one choose . easily par beatle white album or stones , exile main street , goodbye yellow brick road remained one rock most valuable creations past 33 years	1
this collection mixed bag . biggest problem i title . i am unsure how they decided these 16 songs " biggest " hits , but it obvious many other worthy johnny cash songs left off cd . if you looking more comprehensive collection , i recommend either " essential johnny cash , " which 16 tracks , or " legend " boxed set , which more than 100 songs . best this collection introduction johnny cash . many my favorite johnny cash songs included this collection . " i walk line " made famous anew recent movie same name . note how bass guitar used this song . " don't take your guns town " more spoken than sung , classic country there . " ring fire " classic cash song , written june carter merle kilgore . " folsom prison blues " seemed ever-present radio 60s . carl perkins song " daddy sang bass " late 60s hit cash . " boy named sue " mega-hit cash 1969 both country pop charts , seemed every it combined light-hearted humor cash down-to-earth style . i am unhappy this version song because one portion bleeped out . funny song nearly impossible learn radio " one piece time , " story how auto worker built cadillac parts procured piece time over more than 30 years . course this collection includes many more songs . many these songs received lot airplay helped secure cash early entry into rock roll hall fame , country music hall fame , songwriters hall fame , one very few people who inducted all three ( hank williams , sr. jimmie rodgers others date this review ) . difficulty singer such cash , who received numerous country music awards , grammy awards other awards , there so much music choose meets requirements " best . " thus , this cd should never called " best " because it not . if you really looking " best " real justice johnny cash , try either " essential johnny cash " or " legend " boxed set . price both makes either worthwhile , particularly if you looking something more than just tantalizing introduction one most influential singers music history .	1

after enjoying 2005 model dave grohl band so much , i thought i'd go back listen again his debut cd foo . it holds up really well after ten years , our first chance hear winning blend melodicism punk power . some slower tunes slightly preview acoustic disc 2005 foo album your honor , especially " big me . " other places , " weenie beenie , " grohl rocks out harder than anything this side probot . best songs all ones bit both worlds - slower verse harder chorus - cuts such " all cows .

i always heard godspeed you ! black emperor certain friends mine record critics hailing their brilliance , but i didn't really give them much listen until few months ago , when i downloaded songs " east hastings " " dead flag blues " off internet . i amazed what i heard : slow , mournful almost classical musical pieces haunting violins heavily reverbed guitar , giving way repeated melody until it climaxes into powerful burst sound , then simmering back into beauty it started . i truly impressed . i then bought their first album , #a #oo , it one finest debut albums i've ever heard . after i listened it few months , i decided get their most recent album , yanqui u.x.o. , it one best albums i heard long time . starters , it very different gy ! . older material very basic idea ( build-build-release ) , it always worked , but this time around , gy ! decided play around their formula . there no found vocals album ( where older material sound clips various movies interviews ) , some material doesn't repeat much early stuff . opener , " 9-15-00 " closest thing early godspeed . slow mournful guitar melody gives way more instruments varying melody , then repeating central hook until song explodes noise , then simmering into long ambient section . song divided into two tracks , which great if you want hear particular part . " rockets fall rockets fall " new step collective . spooky sounding echoed guitar begins song , followed sad violin heavily phased guitar , not sounding too far wendy carlos ' evil soundtrack clockwork orange . after long section scary bleak chords , we treated simulation bomb falling down clarinets tubas providing descend . then , timpani plays slow harrowing beat , all members slowly play very eerie sounding melody , very much like soundtrack 1960 sci-fi movie end world ( planet apes , perhaps ? ) . then , song explodes out nowhere , we back apocalypse , all bombs rockets bursting , signalling end human race . pretty bleak stuff . " motherf***er = redeemer " quite different anything gy ! past . droning xylaphone begins song , sounding lot like sigur ros new album , there , song begins . we treated lot fragile guitar work , song once again gets louder , but then real treat comes . song become quiet long long time , fragile guitar beginning slow bass lines coming through speakers , lulling you sleep . then , amazing second part comes , funky ( very suprising ! ) bassline coming , gy ! playing very sad deafining music funk groove playing background . it quite different anything they've yet , i applaud them new risks they took album . this their best work yet , i cannot wait next album come out , though i'm not sure when it come out . if they though , i hope it step right direction this album shown . gy ! can't wrong ever	1

i bought this cd 1995 , it great friend these past ten years . i'm not dance music kinda guy , but i make exception new order ( or future sound london ! ) , their music not devoid substance vast majority music exists make us shake our rumps . there hard-to-define melancholy running through much this music , almost mystical feeling . i often find myself quietly singing these songs am not surprised when they conjure up some strange emotions , or longing ache solar plexus . " vanishing point " always reminded me william blake .	1
one those albums you cannot stop listening . beautiful melodies , crunchy beats - really nice amalgamation electronic acoustic instrumentation .	1
this one first dark ambient albums i ever exposed , but remains my current rotation albums its incredible textures balance ominous beautiful . pairing robert rich brian williams ( lustmord ) somewhat odd one , robert rich ambient stylings always leaned more towards ethereal worldbeat genres execution ( though final product fortunately strays quite far confines those genres ) lustmord built his name sort proto-industrial sound engineer creator dark , abrasive musique concrete . however , their pairing make incredible textured dark listen . what album lacks abrasiveness , it makes up its ability instill feeling foreboding listener . this isn't quite lines most dark ambient , but nonetheless fantastic album surprisingly great pairing . admittedly , i've fallen away robert rich style quite bit late , this album his strata collaboration steve roach remained two favorite albums mine i discovered myself last year	1
i found this band looking music resembled bravery , depeche mode , few my other favorite bands . while ' i love you ... " different band altogether , i very happy add this album my collection . music very dreamy even though song start strong bass or drum riff , you surprised how song descend into calming soundscape . me , this band perfect listen when you mood relax . not gym music . newbies band should check out their first single " according plan " . me , i don't particularly favorite song because album blends together so well i simply enjoy it whole ( although one would pleased check out " we choose faces " ) . this one album you happy say you own , band you proud say you started listening before they hit it big .	1
i bought this cd , almost immediately after i saw " dance me , " theaters , back 1998 . though , film left me cold , songs continued sizzle my memory , resonated my steps dance floor . some best songs this album include : " magalenha , " great sergio mendes tune utilized dance competition sequence film . it lively samba , gets you up your feet moving . " atrevete ( no puedes conmigo ) " dark latin groove awesome , sizzling salsa , combining fiery vocals huey dunbar , salsa/reggae elements fragancia james " da barba . " what shame those guys broke up ........ overall , this cd combines soft ballads up-tempo dance numbers . it great background music party . only reason i didn't give it five stars because luke warm bonus cuts ( " suavemente " remix elvis crespo -- which sounds too repetitive " pantera en libertad " monica naranjo , which just sounds like she screaming -- no real melody ) . you definitely need get this album , well , because it just too flavorful resist !	1

metalheads , this album classic ! there absolutely nothing like this when it came out . even though band last two albums heavy their time , this album kicked heaviness up notch . several notches fact ! exciter metal classic , perfect opener . rob wails like there no tomorrow solos here rule . gotta love double bass les binks throws here . this old school speed metal , no kidding ! white heat red hot slows things down , but still stays heavy . this track pretty darn catchy , i love rob vocals here . better you better than me catchy tune , but it cover spooky tooth song . i love guitar here , sounds like classic rock rather than heavy metal but it still rocks ! savage starts off some high yells rob this song just smokes , chorus definitely highlight . how heck man reach those notes ? heavy riffs here too ! invader starts off some cool guitar effects ( sounds like ufo landing ) goes into kick ass song darn catchy chorus , i know you sing this one yourselves ! even guitar solo catchy ! saints hell heavy song . riffs here so heavy , i mean they practically beat you upside head . i love it when rob shrieks " wake dead , saints hell ! " you know you love ! heroes end some killer riff-work , just flat out rocks . stained class famous galloping riff we all know love some notes rob hits here amazing ! guitar solo here very melodic , i love it when , towards end , song gets heavier . back then , those probably some heaviest riffs ever heard ! beyond realms death f*cking masterpiece . acoustic work beautiful , when song picks up rob begins his yelling , your mind blown i guarantee it ! no one convey emotion rob during slow parts ! glenn solo breathtakingly emotional , while . . ' fast paced crushing . it all ends rob brilliant shriek " beyond realms death " . very nice . bonus tracks include cool live version better you better than me fire burns below . it nice keyboard playing very experimental . too bad it wasn't released earlier ( i hear it meant turbo or ram it down , i can't remember ) . i am sorry but you need this album if you want metalhead , this pushed metal light years beyond what it time . no one else played these heavy riffs all . so buy this album enjoy what these guys gave us	1

i met jim saint peterburg , fl , several years ago , he one most gentle souls comedy . his act combines sarcasm self-deprecation even little multiple-personality disorder thrown good measure ( he constantly reviews his act while he doing it voice bewildered audience member ) it simply hilarious . he just big goofy doofus genius iq ability find humor just any situation . if you've never heard jim , yourself favor buy this cd . it gem . even better , listen his appearances opie anthony xm radio channel 202 . unlike some comics only work off their material , jim funny when he just conversation his xm appearances radio gold .	1

this album largely underappreciated when it first came out . but truth it improves springsteen first record , " greetings asbury park , " practically every aspect . bruce vocals stronger more confident . street band rhythm section improved . this especially noticeable funky , upbeat numbers like " street shuffle " " kittys back " , where you vividly imagine crowd getting into groove bars clubs band likely playing time . slower songs better well , example " sandy " blows away " mary queen arkansas " - draggy ballad first album . lyrics also grew , words became less derivative dylan more uniquely bruce , especially his ability convey beauty ugliness life jersey boardwalk . finally , " rosalita " comes roaring through best song bruce written up this point . here all romance , adventure courage youth bruce calls out rosie leave her overprotective family join him highway , where they escape " swamps jersey " seek out " pretty little place southern california " he dreams . course , this search freedom escape powerful theme which continues resonant springsteen future music . this record also marked transitional phase , bruce began leave behind flowerly words experimental sounds create tighter , more precise lyrics music his later albums . but , bruce " glory days " jersey shore this record highlight	1

face dances should never made . townshend , who chief songwriter , put all his best post-moon material empty glass , leaving table scraps this album . music pop-synth oriented , uninspired bloody boring . " don't let go coat " " cache cache " ( " ... there ain't no bears there , cache cache ... " huh ? ) embarrasing . other than " you better you bet , " songs forgetful best . poor kenny jones target who fan anger 25 years , but this lackluster album not his fault . he just drummer . face dances lousy because songwriting , not drumming . live act , who good enough mr. jones skins , it makes sense they tried jump start their careers him . understandably , band shaken after keith death , but why even bother putting out new material this bad ? least next who mach ii album , it hard , some great songs . even bonus tracks , face dances bargain bin album . don't waste your money this ; go out get empty glass , all best cowboys chinese eyes it hard .	1

late-seventies early-eighties , foreigner one top bands , placing 12 songs top 40 1977 1982 including three million-selling singles . what puzzling why rhino released this latest collection which technically simply abbreviated version rhino 2000 2-disc collection jukebox heroes . earlier release contains all 30 tracks found definitive collection plus nine additional tracks including album cuts , minor singles couple spooky tooth tracks mick jones ' previous band . so math . how deleting nine songs anthology that still print make it " definitive " ? answer : it doesn't!if you're looking most comprehensive collection , stick jukebox heroes . sure it few dollars more , but it tells foreigner story more thoroughly , it only anthology include tracks their 1995 release mr . moonlight . music definitive collection certainly first rate , but when you look other choices ( including 2002 excellent single-disc complete greatest hits ) , this latest release unnecessary	1
holy toledo this album absolutely amazing . all yoko kanno stuff cowboy bebop , most her stuff general , mind-blowingly varied , creative , engaging , but this jewel crown . it pinnacle seatbelts music collective , it features deep wonderous sampling all group capable . when playing this disc friends , i feel need say , " this same band " every track , because they're all so different . album -- which soundtrack " cowboy bebop : movie " -- opens " 24 hours open , " strange circus-esque carnival chaos which both amusing , disturbing highly forgettable . but there album takes off . " pushing sky " aggressive , echoing anthem rock . " time know " flute-tinged waltz what appears japanese rapping end . " clutch " some best freeform jazz i've ever heard . " musawe " sounds like arabian folk . " yo pumpkinhead ! " big band extravaganza ( martian halloween parade , those who seen movie ) . " digging " bluesrock . so . nearly every song different genre ( " 7 minutes , " orchestral techno metal number 7:4 time , qualifies several ) nearly every song masterwork said genre . " fingers " flowing piano/fingerpiano dub . " butterly " gorgeously subdued ballad . " gotta knock little harder " awesomely crafted pop anthem reminiscent annie lennox her very best . that just first disc . bonus second disc 11 more songs , which range ambient electro ( " chapter 23 " ) stomping scavenger pop ( " ask dna , " which might owe its existence beck " where it " ) . few songs , particularly disc 2 , show , not movie , but these all so good they fit right you won't care . i cannot say enough this album . it one greatest triumphs music i've ever heard , tribute 100 years american musical tradition fair amount japanese music well , outstanding release its own right . it worth whatever you pay it	1

unfortunately , only people who listen stooges type people who concerned history rock music more than music itself . type people who've spent more time reading rock music than actually listening it . kind people who organize their record collections relevance . other words , rock snobs . first , i'll get rock history surrounding this album out way before talking why this such great rock roll record while attempting not confuse two subjects . proto-punk category tough define since nobody knew what punk rock music going . further confuse matters , punk doesn't really universal definition . purpose this review , i'll define punk loud , raw nihilistic rock music . velvet underground largely recognized beginning punk rock . lyrics dark hateful music some raw moments . if you listen very closely , you may able hear those elements . however , surface they sound much closer bob dylan than sex pistols . mc5 definitely loud , aggressive raw enough musically qualify punk , but lyrically weren't nihilistic . they preached left-wing politics which certainly shock value most people time . people who feel clash definitive punk band should check out mc5 since clash owes quite bit mc5 both lyrically musically . new york dolls shock factor most people equate punk they played sloppier than most `77 punk bands . lyrics trashy sleazy enough considered nihilistic . only thing held them back annoying piano made their sound too large . stooges every element place fuel perfect punk rock fire " raw power . " describe their music loud raw just doesn't it justice . it sounds like destruction their instruments through overdrive . nihilistic lyrics ? it not possible get much more nihilistic than lyrical content this album . top , iggy pop delivered it all absolute sincerity disturbing emotion . it actually much more raw hard than many `77 punk albums . punk unquestionably began this album . it preceded new york dolls 1973 debut album few months . punk bands 1976 - `77 almost universally influenced " raw power . " when ramones kick started punk movement their debut album , only other things they added punk sound created stooges faster tempo they eliminated all other instruments besides guitar , bass , drums . remixing remastering album `90 , it depends whether you value actual sound instruments or history . most people realize you listen music hear instruments like you remix . it really tough hear history unless you've read or heard it , which completely unnecessary enjoyment music reality . there isn't any re-recording or anything else new mixed here , so don't fear " raiders lost ark " type tampering . most record reviews this album include word " primal . " that accurate , but it goes even further than . rock roll yet achieve such physical experience this album provides 1973 few albums able since . tapping into human drive sex violence provides enjoyment all parties involved . it entertainment sense power instigator euphoric experience recipient . stimulation those instincts leads break false reality materialistic society . other words , living instinct leads true freedom . over-driven guitar certainly dominates sound record which accounts violence people associate this music . " search destroy , " " your pretty face going hell , " " raw power " riffs qualities slash , burn , rip every touch . rhythm section more than keep time rhythm . it gives music heartbeat keeps it breathing heavy . bass lays down sweaty grooves throbs which demands much attention guitar songs like " penetration , " " i need somebody . " say drumming drives whole thing understatement . songs like " shake appeal " all but take control everything song feeling like rest musicians no choice but play . through whole album drums pound snap like stampede wild bores . iggy vocals style lyrics compliment everything perfectly . sleazy , sick , hateful , strange , wild , insane . whether if he sounds subdued or frenzied , he always feels menacing . fear incited through vocals heightens this experience beyond audio stimulation . " raw power " rock roll its peak potential . it just essential all other rock roll greats ranging hendrix led zeppelin ac/dc . it too bad album only known underground music fans , but it hard imagine any these songs any radio station .	1
i find it hard believe this same ray parker jr. played guitar barry white hits ' 70s . he really benefited hits he raydio solo artist . i still love funky catchy you can't change ! i could play 50 times never get tired it ! jack jill i still love . funk beds those who like groove i still loooove ! i still like macho sounding bad boy -- shame you ray lyrics funky groove ! he makes lovely smooth ballads woman needs love , let me go , two places others . some songs like jamie girls more fun don't age very well their dinky keyboards . i still can't get over sounds little like lionel richie me . but i still love ghostbusters its driving , funky groove ! it huge pop hit , movie huge hit just made ray well received artist . but it just clicks fact ray played most music musicians like martin page song too ! he one ' 80s best artists musicians this album proves it !	1
first foremost , not frightened slightly bling-like nature album cover depicts . saying goes " don't judge book its cover " , same this cd . nowhere here canibus acting jiggy or throwing us life-less garbage microphone like most mainstream artists . this cd sorta like canibus crack going mainstream again , but keeping it grimey enough not alienate his long-time fans . production handled nicely nottz other producers , but not every beat blazing , some fall ' average ' pile not stand out . majority negative reviews this album received because they unfairly comparing it bootleg wasn't supposed released . they just upset not every song ' new material ' . this album spoiled early bootlegging beginning 2005 . album originally supposed released may , but 14 tracks ( 6 which appear altered formats this album ) leaked through unreleased ' virtruvian man ' mixtape ... honestly , virtruvian man slightly better than this album ( probably because it supposed pressed hiphop sale - exception freestyled tracks ) ... rather , some tracks virtruvian man released hh4s some newer unheard tracks ... tracks *' appeared virtruvian man ( i unbiased possible song reviews)its no other than * ( 5 out 5 ) --- this album first single this joint banger . nottz produced really funky track bis triumphantly screaming over it . this version remastered virtruvian man extra vocals added into it . back wit heat * --- ( 4.5 out 5 ) nottz track , but much grimier feel than its no other than . here bis showcasing his ability craft some menacing rhymes over darker production . this version remastered its original one . benny riley --- ( 4 out 5 ) beat real funky grimey , although bis vocals way too raspy over this . still good track though . show em how * --- ( 4 out 5 ) this really funky beat nottz . bis spitting comical lethal rhymes listener . dear academy * ( 3.5 out 5 ) --- this track everyone loves hate . personally it not crazy other tracks , but it provides cool introspective canibus he talking all people he worked past who've blown up since then ... i gotcha * ( 3.5 out 5 ) --- this track original version virtruvian man better . dmp this version though , but their vocals too quiet . mixing this track ruined what otherwise hot song . so into you ( 2.5 out 5 ) --- interesting , pretty much sums up review here . canibus spittin love ballad , oddly enough its still pretty decent although very unorthodox . he gets points versatility ... da facelift * ( 10 out 5 ) --- this track appear virtuvian man but different beat . production this version godly . canibus old 100% present here . absolute banger track !!! hip hop body rock ( 5 out 5 ) --- like ' so into you ' this side canibus i didn't see coming , however , this representation shown much better . very funky crazy track ! take dat ( 3.5 out 5 ) --- two very lackluster tracks close off album . production this track very lacking bis vocals although its not bad beat . main problem after first minute track bis spittin you get 2 no-names after . punchlines ( 3 out 5 ) --- i want like this song but i cannot . lyrically its hot , but beat just eeeeehhhhh depressing ... all all this still decent album , but overall hotness it comes random times . complaint its only 42 minutes long . i want hear more !!! i just wish virtuvian man never leaked because i garauntee hiphop 4 $ale would've much hotter!!!i'd still cop it though	1
perpetual complaint j.j. cale he always records same record . i'm happy report charge may true . bright side , end result mr. cale never recorded bad album , his songs always soulful beautiful passionate no matter how simple or laidback they . emotional core his music what makes songs/albums appear all alike , this consistency makes him artist unlike any other . or , okey , like very selected few . album front you , " 5 , " perhaps one his best . ( many fans - many personal favorites you'll find . ) it certainly high my list , i'll admit it . it pure j.j. magic : mix bag blues , country , soul , subdued funk , traces early digital life ( simple rhythm machines echoes synths , remember , this 1979 ) suggestions what would later defined " americana , " - mix makes mr. cale sound so unique . never taking himself very seriously , j.j. created opus serene colorful life west , mixing effortlessly bits sadness humor earnestness joy paint mini pictures life simple pleasures ( or troubles , depending where you stand ) . songs make you smile your own blues , justifying feeling while making it bit ridiculous . what makes this album stand out whole opus one track - " sensitive kind , " which i like define perhaps only song ever presented cinemascope old fashioned technicolor . if you imagine . it simple love song preaches better understanding promotes patience everlasting battle sexes , but it so touching it'll make your skin crawl . strings horns mellow solo guitar rhodes piano ... ah , pure beauty . if record worth , anything - it this track . i'm not saying rest bad - i love " friday , " " boilin ' pot , " " mona , " " don't cry sister , " name just few - it just " sensitive kind " such standout track , it towers over whole mr cale lifetime achievements . pretty much makes this album one . bit warning : although listed , latest universal pressing this cd doesn't contain " katy kool lady " if track you crave , you may end up disappointed ; instead , there mysterious track it place which bonus hardcore fans but some could upset if they want exact replica original lp . ( i'm lucky , i original vynil so i'm not complaining . ) also raises question : why universal music group so cheap ? i'm not even sure they properly remastered . . ' catalog they own , reprinted covers so poorly designed i'm thinking i'd better job converting my vynils into digital tracks just xeroxing covers . instead , why not expand existing albums outakes and/or some rare tracks - i'm sure there some lying around , one included here mistake living proof - maybe add liner notes fan or cale opus connoisseur , or even some musicians who admire him so much , why not make it worthy such great talent mr. cale ? unless happens soon , stick this edition , you not regret single note music here	1
wow i just don't know where start this album . well , album itself : i think this best explained band , so here what they think- " how strange , innocence " our first attempt album . we recorded it january 2000 austin : recording took two days , mixing one day , mastering one day . altogether we pressed 300 cd-r copies this album ... we band seven months when we recorded these songs . lot feelings ( excitement/confusion/glimpses visions/waking dreams/inability play instruments ) went into this record , but we didn't quite know what those feelings , none us even really studio before , it shows recording , songs show it , too--it young record . there no tricks it . there lightness few songs we probably won't reach again . it sounds strange say instrumental songs something , but us these songs were/are such things couple walking through park winter day , child playing 70 shag carpet , story boy hero leading revolution against tyranny coal mines . we've bit love/embarrassment relationship record . certain points way several us wanted buy back all copies burn them . listening now this album , it almost seems like different band composed four different people . we finally feel okay re-releasing it , probably because we've now made couple records recorded better closer our visions them . anyway , we truly appreciate anyone who interested listening . thank you . " cd itself- hope you found helpful . i like this cd two reasons . 1 . wonderful way explosions sky tell story through their instruments . 2 . this album distinct sound- one all its own . if you didn't like explosions sky before , you once you listen this album . -sherman .	1

it amazes me material artists like sonny james so poorly represented todays marketplace . quot ; gentleman southquot ; still holds record most consecutive #1 hits billboard country charts ( 16 ) charted over 20 #1 hits . so where they all ??? his years capitol records ( covered this disc ) would fill 15 disc box set . these all great tunes but there just aren't enough them	1

if that exaggeration , it not big one . this thing went my ipod shuffle soon i got it , i can't stop listening . sound quality unbelievably good , song choices practically " best " their early work . if anything , i'd say lot songs sound even better than their studio versions , especially green manalishi ( where halford delivers hellishly haunting wail reminiscient original peter green version ) , victim changes ( much faster heavier ) . four (!) additional live tracks apperently same concert (?) make already spectacular live album much better . if only ever buy one priest cd , make it this one . it just good	1
cheyenne kimball sure rocking it her first album ! it took me 25 days listen it , but it consistent effort . this succeeds far beyond mtv show she making this album . all numbers full energy , solid melodies rhythms , heavy guitars ! her guitar playing dynamic all numbers she good songwriter . sure , she people like kara dioguardi , greg wells , eddie head , raine maida , chantal kreviazuk , billy mann , scott cutler anne preven produce songs , but this album all cheyenne . course she new , but her approach gives kelly clarkson run her money rock end . you don't even think outside help 7 producers this effort , because you all into cheyenne own sound musical vision . one more exciting refreshing debuts i've listened this year	1
dylan authentic sounds so this acoustic guitar voice cd . songs great classics , but recording weak insofar lyrics not clear . this album would so much better if you could hear great classic lyrics these great songs . so , 4 stars instead 5 , weak recording detracts what otherwise would classic .	1
i'd known gits while ( seattle underground music scene great until nirvana broke big oversaturated country its own brand quasi-grunge ) , but i hadn't heard gits ' music very long time . i recently saw updated episode ae cold case show . it reminded me give gits listen , but most all , it reminded me how much talent world lost when it lost mia . thankfully , mia murder solved ( albeit just few months back ) . i must say gits definitely special band , most unique frontwoman . mia gravely , emotion-tinged voice conveyed alienation , loneliness , introspection way art-poseur junkie like cobain never could . it total shame mia isn't around anymore .	1
i owned all albums buena vista social club veterans this one i waited great anticipation . i'm proud say i am not disappointed . all selections this album superb guajiro mirabal playing trumpet simply superb , most specially , if you aware he more than 70 years old . trumpet sound very annoying because its inherent loudness but hands(or mouth ) guajiro mirabal , it simply intoxicating . i played album any time day it never failed amaze me . you listen it any kind mood you . morning . late afternoon . late night . i highly recommend this album , all albums buena vista social club members . let enjoy this music . this kind music you not get tired listening . why ? because they made real musicians . all sounds you hear coming real instruments all recorded live studio . if you tired listening " manufactured " music , this kind music surely give you entirely different experience	1

i just imagine excitement this set must generated among dylan fans when this set released . biograph so much more than retrospective because all unreleased material it . set opens " visions johanna " sixty-six tour draws you right into music . just imagine , dylan fans wait two more decades finally get whole sixty-six show legal bootleg series . " quinn eskimo " third song record recorded mr. d isle white show sixty-nine curiously enough left off " self portrait " where you find more songs show . " you're big girl now " " tangled up blue " out takes " blood tracks . " " i wanna your lover " " crawl out your window " both songs left over sixty-six . " percy song " one true gems this set earlier acoustic period . there more , so much more . this one fine five star bob dylan set if you don't own it , you should . reviewed stephanie san	1

this great compilation , but i never pay close $90 used copies . before i saw these highway robbery prices i dead set against record piracy . too bad i'll never get own it , unless it reissued resonable price . i thoroughly despise remakes great songs , so his greatest hits album no good either . 5 stars cd , zero price tag	1
i like album more than loveless . don't get my wrong , loveless great , but it very calculated every song shares same sort sound dense layers voice turned down . isn't anything pure shoegaze . this album rocks funky songs like soft snow seven girls galore , bleak " sueisfine " " you never should " , this really great album worthy its follow-up worth listen	1
warren really missed boat . he go down hip hop history introduced his cousin snoop dogg dr. dre , semi-hit michael mcdonald-sampling " regulators " . " regulate- funk era " quite possibly single most overlooked album all time . these days , dr. dre universally regarded number one beatmaker , warren hold his own against doc . " chronic " considered one greatest hip-hop albums all time ; " regulate- funk era " should regarded similarly its funky parliament-influenced production streetwise sermons ( some things catapaulted chronic " classic status " ) . what i'm trying say , era g-funk , when dr. dre , d.o.c. , n.w.a. , snoop dogg , eazy revered kings game , warren criminally overlooked . he most likely never get respect he deserves making this classic album . fans every artist album i've mentioned . standouts include " regulators " , " so many ways " , " this shack " .	1
i am no means expert loreena mckennitt works . i own just this album her most popular album book secrets . although book secrets made ms. mckennitt popular because song mummer dance , which received air play even some popular music stations , visit contains some wonderful songs . all souls night quick song ancient celtic holiday samhain . pagans believed october 31st , last day summer , spirits dead wandered landscape looking bodies inhabit . living lit bonfires , sang songs , dressed scary costumes frighten away dead . if you let your mind wander , this song almost transport you ancient ireland . historians know so little certain ancient pagan beliefs , mckennitt well-studied songs lyrics help bring this lost culture back life . lady shalott masterpiece this album . adapted poem alfred tennyson , mckennitt sets it music brings poem life . over 11 minutes long , mckennitt deleted hardly word original poem , yet music intonation rivet listener attention . poem spirit or elfish woman drawn ancient mythical city camelot beauty castle sir lancelot . even way mckennitt pronounces word camelot song conveys sacred nature this most important legend english mythology . poem song touch your heart . me , i watch modern england quickly losing it historic culture , this song serves reminder england once . mckennitt adapts long poem english literature her later album book secrets . mckennit faithfully puts word alfred noyes ' highwayman into heart-wrenching song . again , over 10 minutes long , this formula mckennitt very well . if i choose just one album loreena mckennitt , it would book secrets . but it would cruel choice make . i look forward someday owning all her works anxiously await her next recording .	1
i wasn't ry cooder fan but i've discovered respect him after these associations . previous posters seem think ry cooder only guitarist , which would surprise manuel galban . ibrahim voice amazing his story . bvsc film basically film sessions this album . i think ry deserves ' props ' bringing this music much wider audience than expected . i'm sure people read ' whiter ' audience well . lighten up , shake off ghost dance . i would also like mention production this other bvsc incredible , much better than other productions modern latin music	1
they've pretty well captured some problems this particular album , which rare wonderful event . if you've listened paul simon songbook , you know , while he could occasional good job ( kathy song ) , his early twenties , paul simon not much songwriter . this relatively direct , unnuanced , pretentious record what essentially direct , unnuanced , pretentious time . times , it sound like angsty teenage girl private poetry collection . these all correct valid assertions , if sort thing going bother you , you might better advised stay away . what album also , however , number quality musical efforts . kathy song april , come she both good indicators what come paul simon his later work . while this may among least simon garfunkel collective output , worst their five records still better than large body other music . regarding bonus material , this also one those happy instances where i actually recommend buyers interested getting newly expanded cd they buy it . rather than mess demos mono mixes sound essentially same ( policy columbia pursued much other paul simon rereleases ) , this cd actually four previously unavailable , mostly good songs its credit . i could personally lived my life without hearing simon garfunkel interpretation barbriallen , but fans happy all additional material . other listeners , if you're just looking " best " simon garfunkel record , or start duo , it might better try bookends or bridge over troubled water first . fans , well , you probably already own this record i'm not sure why you're still listening . more casual listeners just search good overview , you'll probably satisfied best simon garfunkel ( twenty song collection - rather than greatest hits - gives more thorough overview ) . people who just like good music , however , while i can't recommend this their best record , it certainly worthy listen	1

reason i bought this cd track " remedy . " it would play often local hard rock station every time i heard it i knew i wanted check out cd . i finally jotted down many lyrics i could search found seether . i loved first two tracks right away but wasn't sure rest cd . i recently purchased " one " three days grace listening constantly several weeks . i think i immediately compared two cds didn't think " karma effect " measured up . more i listen seether cd , though , more i like . booklet very creative . pages artwork or strange photographs , , matted , semi-transparent , plastic sheets lyrics printed silver . i thought cool first until i tried read them . even paper underneath , they're difficult read . oh well , least they're trying different . there photo band behind cd holder . now tracks : " because me " : awesome opener ! energetic explosive catchy hooks chorus . like " remedy , " it grabbed me right away wouldn't let go . " remedy " : reason i bought this cd ! verses sound lot like nirvana " come you " ( it almost sounds like kurt cobain singing , too ) . this track flat out rocks ! " truth " : slower verses picks up into hard rockin ' , yet catchy chorus . additional guitar during final chorus awesome ! heavier than other tracks here . becoming one my favorites . " gift " : beginning offers slow verse nice guitar accompaniment followed accessible , power chorus . almost country flavor ( it not country , don't worry ) . it nice but it tend drag . it 5:34 sounds every bit long . " burrito " : one heavier tracks here . it very dark sound like tool . " given " : this more accessible track than " burrito " but incorporate some korn/ill nino-like screams . " never leave " : slower , power song really sticks my head better or worse . " world falls away " : rocker ! guitar accompanying verses highlight . then some korn/ill nino-like screams build intensity . one line end " i'm just like you , just not cool " ( line throughout track " just not fool " ) so mundane . " tongue " : track begins line " well tongue inside my mouth not sale " ( uh , ok ) . slower , power song but this one excellent chorus . " i'm one " : now we're rocking ! this may my favorite this cd ( it right up there first two tracks , anyway ) . check out these lyrics : " here she coming she drunk again / she only seventeen / here daddy said `well that enough come my little queen ' / now he touching her wrong again / he going give her disease / he never wanted it anyway / he only he please / won't you tell her i said i'm one / i couldn't hurt her like everyone / tell her i said i'm one / i don't deserve her . " killer ! " simplest mistake " : heavy track . some bursts intensity but lighter , catchy chorus . " diseased " : this different-sounding track . it soft , dark , mysterious guitar-work . like " burrito , " it very tool-like . " plastic man " : kurt cobain-sounding ballad . i checked song credits see if he wrote it lyrics not included booklet . he didn't write it . anyway , it gorgeous track beautiful guitar-work . hidden track : just some quirky guitar singing language . not really worth 5 minute wait	1
i tend think fa one-hit wonder -- which they -- though i always liked one hit : quot ; western unionquot ; fine , fine pop song . this disc , however , brings light other , surprisingly enjoyable music followed , band struggled build their commercial momentum . they shamelessly repeated riffs motifs song follow-up singles ( quot ; zip code , quot ; example ) , but they also delved into rich lode melodic pop , this generously programmed , 25-song retrospective gives nice , balanced view their work 1965-69 . course they eventually shed their clean-cut image got all druggie psychedelic , that certainly half fun . recommended	1
well , i'm not " drunken frat boy " one reviewers suggested . i've life long love rock roll music . however , growing up i heard my mom country music , what they call now " old country " . me it true country sound , only one i knew growing up . i got turned onto hank iii , when looking online my mom old song hank sr. when i saw hank iii listed - i curious - course . went his web site got hear straight hell online listened entire 1st cd ............. it great , hooked ! this country my mom listened back 60 70 before , country my gpa listened 40 50 before ............. but it here , now very much alive . this cd great - if you can't handle it , well , your not country music lover . nashville country different ..... bad different ..... if you can't hear it , your tone deaf ! rock hank iii - just fan illinois . jbradford5775@cdnet.cod.edup . . if you come back illinois , my mom i want come hear you ! keep creating your great sound	1
this cd captured songs i fondly remembered carmen miranda ( aka , " samba queen " ) . my almost-forgotten favorite songs her , " man lollipop , " " chica chica boom , " " tico-tico , " more , nicely restored this cd coming drabby non-stereo , analog-to-digital high-digital techniques . amazing . but what more amazing these songs first recorded 1930 , 1940's!! it vintage history ( document ) , which we should never ever forget insatiable carmen miranda her work art , nonetheless . this must item those who also like song " mama eu quiero " ( remember bugs bunny stage performing singing it during 1970s cartoon bugs bunny ; he performed chiquita banana woman song , also known carmen miranda ) . execs this cd , thanks capturing ( fun ) history !	1
i bought this cd 1991 still play many tracks it , especially " valerie loves me " , " diane " " very first lie . " all songs i used listen early 90s , " valerie " still holds one my all time favorites i used know someone name many , many , many years ago . it too bad rest material issue mercury catalog gone out print because jim ellison his band ability write record fairly wide variety musical styles . if you ever find copy " destination universe " buy it because it some best power pop ballads i ever heard 1990s . mercury should reissue this well " freak city soundtrack " put out greatest hits compilation feature cover tracks " bus stop " , " bad time , " " cowboy song " " blockbuster " long out print	1
i love prince music . some looked this album step down purple rain but complete b.s. it more creative artistic move prince revolution . my personal favorite track ladder . back up vocals superb wendy , lisa , susannah , taja sevelle . i love it .	1
when this cd came out , i like ... " okay , this going new wave 21st century ! " plantation lullabies " so far ahead it time its not funny ! but fact mainstream success continues elude this truly original genius beyond me ! if you like delving into new , now , future , beyond all boundaries genre ho-hum radio ga-ga .. then this album quench your thirst like no other	1
bring family one most easily likable records 80s , probably most instantly accessible hiatt career . he still featurs couple songs off here his live shows . band ( hiatt , nick lowe bass , ry cooder guitar , jim keltner drums ) would reconvene 1992 overlooked gem , little village . here cooder gentle sweeping guitar perfect compliment hiatt " lipstick sunset " " tip my tongue , " two most exquisite songs you're likely hear . course big hit " thing called love , " although not until bonnie raitt put it out following year . quintessentially american record , probably best one our true masters . place where rock , folk , country , blues converge form real , authentic american music . i'm calling it classic	1
this album perfect pop album . everything album brillant . number tracks , length ( 38 minutes ) , production , lyrics , voice , not mention every track catchy , only thing i complain there not booklet lyrics but minor thing . you huming these songs days . every track great . it my top 10 list this year right now it number 2 behind chili peppers " stadium arcadium . " only two albums coming out may beat it ( i think ) jayhawks related release golden smog , tom petty . if you enjoy jayhawks or good pop music give this listen , you won't disappointed . favorite tracks : " that game , " " ivy , " " girl/world , " " just like you	1
travis tritt one most unique ( stylistic ) singers arrive " modern " country music scene . while not nearly traditional dwight , not gifted guitarist his cohort , marty , travis tritt one most recognizable , original , true-to-form artist our genre ; his voice , although original , beckons back glory days early hank jr conway twitty .... throw little greg allman while we're it . personally , i prefer traditional country sound , but admit occasionally dabbling southern rock ; travis taken over where bocephus left off early ' 90 . this album combination his more rolicking " southern-fried " boogie numbers well some true honky-tonk classics . not many artists ability include hard driving rock-induced numbers " t-r-o-u-b-l-e " " ... drive your country " such traditional songs like " help me hold " " sometimes she forgets ( song written much thinner literate steve earle ) " . course , there standard ' 90 fare : " drift off dream " , " anymore " , " tell me i dreaming " . , if wasn't enough , his duet marty " whiskey aint working " also included . overall , good album	1
cowboy bebop o.s.t. 2 no disk great soundtrack brings out all little songs make bebop what it . most these songs recieve short treatment show but . never less , make it just so much better . some people may not like songs so this sound track serious fans	1
isley brothers featuring ronald isley a.k.a. mr. biggs - baby makin ' music ( def soul , 2006)maybe introduction ronald isley alter ego , mr. biggs , wasn't so bad after all . it got young people buy isley brothers music ( their new albums ) it revitalized ronald himself . besides , it eleven years since mr. biggs attacked . kelly " down low " it seems if he here say . but after you listen this album , it may seem like ron trying let it go . baby makin ' music may corny title this album ( it better suited isley love ballad compilation ; besides , very few these songs " baby-makin '" persuasion ) but album itself gold major improvement over 2003 body kiss . biggs character brings out some interesting music " forever mackin '" . before you cringe title , song really player until woman he really loves comes him . also , he approaches girl club " pretty woman " . sure , it death but uptempo beat pleasing enough . better songs come form " just came here chill " . written gordon chambers ( who never seem wrong ) ron himself , ron says , " i'm not mr. biggs/tonight i'm just ronald isley . " fast-forward " you helped me write this song " you'll hear him trying dismiss mr. biggs altogether while he proposes his girl . although destined get lost shuffle their more classic albums ( 3+3 , go your guns , eternal ) , this album still great . ernie providing more guitar riffs , . kelly only regulated one song ( " blast off " ) fewer trendy references ( which all opposite what happened body kiss ) , this truly return form isleys . -ej	1
best cd(s ) i own , far . i bought this 2003 blown away . i am not big fan live cds not big fan his before this , just joined music club thought i would get it . needless say , i now seen him live 3 times am amazed each time . his guitar playing beyond amazing this cd . singles he releases not show this . trust me , get this you not sorry .	1
i'm not going tell you how much i loved song reptilia because lot people already , even know it great song . i this cd long time , infact this my first strokes cd . now i listened first impressions earth this it whole bunch , i find myself going back listening this one most even know i own all three . i absolutely love part love hate when " never needed anybody " sung catchy yet mellow twangy guitar follow through . 12:51 one most styled songs this cd . i wish strokes would go back writing couple more songs sound more similar 12:51 . this cd makes me look forward next strokes album more than any others	1
first , i won't go how great this 3-cd set . there plenty other fans here offering conga-line superlatives i agree wholeheartadely . all tunes great much cheaper than paying therapist . i think tom easly one top ten musical geniuses performers last 50 years , certainly one few left hasn't sold out . you won't hear tom music beer or car commercials . orphans definite must-have . however , completists out there , there few songs , most collaborations others , didn't make orphans , nor they elusive ( illegal ) factory-pressed tales underground five-disc series ( must all rain dogs , if you find ' em ) . so if you want tom other orphaned tunes didn't make orphans , following tracks found cds here amazon ( perhaps exception hold 4-track bonus disc , which pops up ebay once awhile ): - i know i've changed ( this * not * same version orphans ; it john hammond his album wicked grin)- kitate ( los lobos ride)- going fetal ( eels blinking lights)- big face money ( short but fun mule variations-era tune paired buzz fledderjon ' hold ' bonus disc)- go tell it mountain ( blind boys alabama go tell it mountain)- i'll tell you why ( dan hicks beatin ' heat)- saw sage ( c-side , coffee cigarettes soundtrack)enjoy ! p.s. tom , if you read this , remember you still owe me twenty bucks gas .	1
anthony hamilton third album entitled " ain't nobody worryin '" . twelve beautiful songs this album produced : mark batson , raphael saadiq , christopher pottinger , james poyser , andre harris vidal davis last but not least kelvin wooten . it necessary mention these producers because together anthony they great job . there variety subjects anthony hamilton addresses " ain't nobody worryin '" . besides loves songs-sung different points view- you'll hear songs critical note towards society some deep comtemporary gospel songs . we know anthony his soulful rnb-songs but there high quality reggae surprise called " everybody " included this album . throughout album you'll hear anthony hamilton singer who born raised south he his roots church . he'll bring you joy , drama , love , hope consolation . " preacher daughter " featuring his wife tarsha ' mcmillian hamilton , it like you hear vicar speaking . anthony hamilton voice gorgeous . it dark , clear so full apparently real emotions which lifts him up far above level average good singer . his lyrics so cleverly chosen combined everyone feels what he singing . example this title song which critical towards society but yet hopeful individual person . song like " pass me over " feels so good soul . two smashing old school beauties " ain't nobody worryin '" that'll take you right down memory lane " never love again " " change your world " . " ain't nobody worryin '" excellent album big southern country boy .	1
this album broken love . there so much sadness here . but there also best cowboy ballad this record since marty robbins ' " el paso " " big iron . " " lily , rosemary jack hearts " just goes , seemingly without end , then poof , it over jack hearts gotten away all cash . you need refreshing , uplifting song like this balance out all heartbreak . once again , bob dylan proven he absolute best whatever he attempts . once again he turned out record once listened , becomes part you . it seems he lot , still doing it	1

momeries 80 . cd all ages , even my 6 yr old loves it	1
i really enjoyed first two books albums , i bought thought food almost immediately after lemon pink because i enjoyed it so much . i found their sound quite original interesting balance emotion humor balance electronic acoustic music . so i really disappointed when i heard their new album . this record clearly intended their breakthrough , far more vocals regular song structure less expirementalism . record even reuses some samples old albums which really annoying . this album lacks interesting , unexpected twists their previous works , result comes off generally bland sometimes even cheesy . if you want books album , please check out other two first	1
well , here we . one true works electronic genre 90 , " lifeforms " true sonic adventure . this obviously some best work fsol ever . " lifeforms " double album electronic ambient moments spliced together , interchanged meshed . ambient work , it lot randomness bright detail thrown rapid pace . there lot energy terse grab songs , despite their ambient . it very original , i praise originality music . give it try , put some " flower " " bird wings " or some " elaborate burn .	1
some people say it mindless racing all , but drifting takes so much skill it not even funny . don't hate , appreciate btw anyone know song scene where han enter his little " club like " place this crib start making out girls	1
after incredibly popular late 80 she some problems regain same popularity 90 when " confide me " " put yourself my place " some few hits i recall . when " lightyears " released she eventually found new image again making disco influented songs . this first three albums this kind sound , although this album got more retro disco other one more modern electro inspired neo-disco influence . this album kicks off " spinning around " biggest hit this album also floorfiller . i prefer " night like this " it neu disco sound happy melody . songs 3-7 typical disco songs , " your disco needs you " sounds like village people . " please stay " pop-disco song , reminds me belinda carlisle " circle sand " bit hook , but it one my favorite songs here just same . " bittersweet goodbye " ballad . not good really . 10-11 also disco songs , " im so high more towards pop . " kids " robbie williams highlight only rock inspired song , but it good alot energy good hook too . it ends neo-disco song " lightyears " also sound she adapted her next album . overall , this great album hence 4 stars . many highlights floorfillers fresh sound . perhaps bit too many retro songs included . i would liked some more rock perhaps one or two decent ballads . but " new " kylie sound sold millions it re-launched her career again . good album nonetheless	1
receiving this album like opening christmas present mid summer . if great songwriting your thing you love sweet melodies , then daniel wylie what you need . this album filled beautiful songs sound like his cosmic rough riders work enjoy melodic sunshine . it more same disc . you love ' define love , ' move me ' especially ' i wouldn't lie ' . tthis stand out song among many great songs . please buy enjoy . i enjoy it	1
while i bought both this cd quot ; telewackerquot ; redd guitar work , my favorite part both cds vocal numbers . redd chooses semi-obscure but classic honky-tonkers his vocal workouts his every-guy voice ( there actually some similarity junior brown ) suits them just fine . standout vocal cuts this cd quot ; big big lovequot ; swing number quot ; end line . quot ; these two cuts alone worth price cd . guitar work this cd , course , excellent . unlike some other guitarists turning out solo albums these days ( scotty anderson comes mind ) , redd doesn't shy away pieces emphasize tone taste over flash notes per second . his instrumental take quot ; i forget you every dayquot ; merle haggard makes some really great listening without resorting needless pyrotechnics . i especially like redd liberal use steel guitar breaks both his cds . this cd he features norman hamlet ( formerly merle haggard ) who adds plenty solid steel . this really enjoyable cd anyone who likes straight ahead country music swing . some original instrumentals nothing special , but there always seems killer cut just around next bend . keep it up , redd ! keep including those vocal numbers	1
all trouble world today , listening this guy you just know everything all right	1
i discovered this album because song , " aguas de marco . " each two artists talented his/her own ; but , combination greater than sum its parts . elis regina sings effortlessly , bringing authentic emotion each song . her voice sexy , sad , joyful , even playful . tom jobim voice music complement elis regina . their music transports listener back simpler time ... even if simplicity mere illusion ( i.e. 1974 wasn't " simpler time " ) . ps -- those who like printed lyrics , this cd all songs ' lyrics portuguese , they all translated into english	1
although always praised critics , lindsey solo album never sold same arena his band , fleetwood mac , or his female counterpart stevie nicks , which shame , because his albums always inspired , never created sake commercial - they his heart soul . this album would my personal favourite buckingham album , because songs like " someones gotta change your mind " " down rodeo " some best songs he produced , fleetwood mac or otherwise , recent years . other stand-outs this collection amazing title track , " shut us down " amazing rolling stones cover , " i am waiting " . fans fleetwood mac amazing guitar work should not look this album .	1
i've listening gypsy kings since i kid now im 21 i still listen them . i these group friends who also listening gk music since their childhood days . it practically our theme song whenever we go beach soak sun . we can't get enough songs ' cause they bring us new world where life just so relaxing . we even put songs during any our dinner parties . it makes us feel like we all spain relaxing glass sanggria just good time	1
this one best power pop albums ever made , great songs like " oldest story world " , " inch inch " , course classic " million miles away " . little history : 1976 band called nerves , made up peter case ( later plimsouls ) , paul collins ( later beat , a.k.a. paul collins ' beat ) , jack lee , recorded 4 song ep . one songs jack lee " hanging telephone " , which became famous 1978 when cover version blondie became hit . this time nerves broken up , various members each gone their separate ways . jack lee released solo album , " greatest hits vol . 1 " , 1981 obscure label , maiden america records . paul collins ' band , beat , made 2 albums 1 ep . peter case band , plimsouls , made ep followed 2 lps , best which this album , " everywhere once " . both case collins subsequent solo albums , plimsouls reformed later album late ' 90s , " kool trash " . so there wealth material fans track down their collections . much it never issued cd , some it very hard find . now good news : 2001 spanish label , penniman records , reissued original nerves 4-song ep , combined 2 other nerves studio tracks , 10 " vinyl-only collection called " 25th anniversary " . only 2000 copies issued , i don't know if it still available but if you find it , i highly recommend it - great stuff . there also french reissue late ' 80s , now long since out print , same 6 nerves songs , plus 4 more live tracks . anyway , i searching those nerves songs years before finally finding penniman records release just few weeks ago . if anyone reading this searching nerves like i , i hope this helps you find it . beware , though , recordings different band also called nerves , which made few albums recently . check record label or personnel info carefully . further collecting , paul collins stuff still not too hard find vinyl , but jack lee album very rare	1
vast majority ( handful ) people who gave this soundtrack less than 4 stars either put off some or all rock bands or out usual ' if they're weird , but enjoyed more than roomful people , they suck/overrated/sold out etc ' . yet , after almost decade , it remains best reason give soundtracks half chance . you're bound skip around , but this absolutely essential album any ' real ' music fan , , able appreciate dark , popular , dark but still popular . like lynch films it conjure all sorts self-conscious meanderings round ' i cool/weird if i like/hate this ' miasma , but make it through enjoy , enjoy more .	1
ok , before we get this album , let clear up few things surrounding ol ' max cavalera lot critiscism that leveled him since beginning soulfly . 1) " his lyrics gone all christian " so guy beliefs don't match up your own ? so what ? why going stop you enjoying his music ? i adore emperor , even though faust neo-nazi homophobic nutjob - nothing music . besides , max lyrics aren't strictly speaking christian . they suggest max believes some kind higher power deity but they also hint strong belief oneself , idea which far more common romanticsm , paganism , even some traditional strands satanism other beliefs incorporated bands like bathory rather than strict , narrow-minded monotheistic belief systems favoured artists like james hetfield dave mustaine ... but that never stopped you playing ' master puppets ' ' rust peace ' million one times , now , it ? 2 ) " he keeps messing around tribal elements pointless instrumentals " tribal element important part sepultura day one . granted , it wasn't always so blatant it soulfly , but these rythyms part all max work ( possible excpetion nailbomb , but even then he still brings little ) . instrumentals , well , i personally love them , think it awesome relatively mainstream metal musician this day age willing broaden their pallete experiment such things . 3 ) " he dyed his dreads pink brought stupid ammount guests ! " again , like first point , fact he anything his physical appearance irrelevant . you know those toddlers enjoy pop bands purely based their image ? if you're refusing listen max because anything trivial colour his hair then there nothing seperating two you , don't so ridiculous . yes , number guest appearances get bit silly during primitive , yes , this produce some terrible music . but lot them worked sounded really cool , lets not forget sepultura began collaborating lot various different tribal artists after while , very impressive results . 4 ) " he song fred durst ! " ok .... you've got me there . i see no way justifying , but hey , everyone makes mistakes , right ? need i remind you limp bizkit nabbed house pain dj ... you going stop listening house pain because ? so , you gonna ignore all max astonishing work sepultura all great music he went make because one poor collaboration ? i'm not saying you listen this song ( i've only able listen it once or twice without wanting wretch myself ) but don't judge artist based one song . 5 ) " he doesn't write thrash anymore ! " enter ' dark ages ' ... without doubt , this best soulfly album max ever written . it much better than new sepultura stuff , even . after hit-and-miss sludgery debut , below-par ' primitive ' no t-t oo-hot ' 3 ' , you'd forgiven maybe thinking max past it , but then ' prophecy ' began pick up pace again set songs not too similair sepultura ' roots ' but definite soulfly feel . well , this soulfly ' chaos ad ' . epic , triumphant thrash successfully married tribal rythyms , eastern folk , dub reggae amongst others . if you ever sepultura fan , you owe it yourself check this out . very impressive .	1
beautiful sound , montana skies flawlessly combines cello guitar into melodies depart ordinary classical . one feel passion they their music . music resonates within one , long after last note . i find myself humming tunes all time ! there something everyone this album . these stressful times i use it work car relax detach hectic day-to-day . aptly named " chasing sun " brings some sun into my day every time i play it .	1

all-time quarterback ! shows what potential your kids could . death cab cutie ben gibbard plays around kid instruments comes up warm charming low-fi masterpiece . half this 11-song , 28-minute disc originally recorded walkman many songs previously released part 1999 all-time quarterback ! cd-ep home-recording cassette-only envelope sessions . whole , all-time quarterback ! feel album hidden tracks or studio outtakes . " plans get complex " simply sing-song its toy guitar broken casio underpinning . previously unreleased " dinner eight suburbs " jaunty " untitled " sound like early pet sounds demos while gibbard employs toy piano seriously alter mood his cover magnetic fields ' " why i cry . " unfortunately , despite this present collection , gibbard hung up atq mantle writing it off fun one-off side project . all-time quarterback ! fine example songs stand their own merits , recordings haven't seen pro tools , combination both into darn good album	1
this tough one call . admittedly , sound quality erato recording rostropovich performing dvorak cello concerto tchaikovsky rocco variations still better than deutsche grammophon digital image bit remastered version rostropovich accompanied karajan berlin philharmonic . certainly both recordings , rostropovich gives warm , passionate performances these works ; his interpretations erato recording may sound more vibrant than these deutsche grammophon cd , but this may more sound quality than his splendidly lyrical playing . however , without question , deutsche grammophon recording offer karajan berlin philharmonic its best . i doubt i heard better concerto recording them ; most noteworthy lush , warm tone created strings , sounding almost warm any i heard vienna philharmonic string sections . you certainly won't go wrong acquiring either deutsche grammophon or erato cds ; i own both enjoy them immensely	1
anybody who regards this album disappointment feels it not quite live up its predecessor ' morning view ' clearly knows nothing incubus ' music . real disappointment infact ' morning view ' , which closest incubus come ' selling out ' or moving into mainstream . much i liked album , i expecting something lot better following two classics ' science ' ' make yourself ' . ' crow left murder ' represents fine return form band . whilst ' morning view ' slow , repetitive boring , this album punchy , interesting , absorbing really shows musical talent each member . also , they seem matured greatly earlier days . ' science ' fun packed full-on angst ridden overcharged heaviness , but this album uses much more appropriate balance styles . anybody could listen it find something they could relate somewhere its journey . incubus what most bands fail ; take metal music make it appeal masses without toning theirselves down all . they simply matured their music . brandon really shows his melodic capabilities aswell admirable extent his vocal range ( see ' talk shows mute ' ' made tv movie ' ) , mike einziger finds true direction adds complex guitar riffs solos his work (' sick sad little world ' amazing ) , new bassist ben kenney adds not just solid basslines but also harmonies which perfectly accompany einziger guitar sections ( hear ' pistola ' ' priceless ' ) . unfortunately , turntablist chris kilmore doesn't quite get chance shine this record ; plenty interesting samples but there noticeable absense scratching comparison bands ' earlier releases . opening track first single ' megalomaniac ' probably incubus ' most impressive start album , politically charged lyrics really show brandon songwriting stature . ' talk shows mute ' , second single album , one softest tracks album shows this band definately capable writing calming songs . ' sick sad little world ' longest song album purely amazing instrumental point view . great riffs , energetic drumming , two-minute long guitar solo middle section this track astound any guitar players who buy this record . ' southern girl ' probably most emotional track album , brandon lyrics beautifully poetic . ' here my room ' shows off guitarist mike einziger true musical talent he incorporates piano first time incubus record . overall , this truly amazing album ... whether you're fan incubus or not i seriously recommend you give this one listen	1

projector dark tranquillity most experimental album date . dark tranquillity one founders gothenburg death metal sound . projector bands walked away typical sound . there still typical melodic death metal riffs harsh vocals , but musical spectrum projector much wider . whole album got more gothic vibe . especially clean vocals use keyboards give album gothic touch . clean vocals sound deep melancholic . guitarists use less melodic death metal riffs play more atmospheric distortion less parts . guitarists use more effects guitars , like flanger-effect . one only fast songs " sun fired blanks " song still rather mid-tempo compared songs earlier albums . song " undo control " band gets little help female quest vocalist . song one my favourite songs . strangest song " day end " , which atmospheric song , without guitars . song consists clean vocals keyboard-sounds . album could heavier parts , but because songs varied well written i highly recommend this album . if you like melancholic metal some melodic death metal elements you like both clean melancholic harsh vocals , then check out projector	1

there particular scene movie " crash " literally left me breathless when i first saw it . this soundtrack , it scene goes track 10 , called " really good cloak . " those who seen film probably already know which scene i'm talking . listening mark isham score itself , months after haveing seen film , i ran across track again found it same effect me . just listening music , i became short breath , i got chills down my spine , one particular point , i felt sting tears first welling my eyes , then spilling down my cheeks . i seeing scene film again , clearly if i watching it all over , feeling same thing before . all because i listening this beautiful , haunting music . after i gathered myself little , i tried imagine same scene different music , or even no music all . while i'm sure it would still powerful moment film , i don't think it could ever so affecting , so purely poignant , it particular piece . clearly , isham crafted piece meticulously scene , just right mix wonder , awe , beauty bring viewer ( listener ) right point where i . quite frankly , anyone listen piece not it affect them all ... well , they're made sterner stuff than i . thing , whole cd sort like . music excellent its own . it ethereally beautiful way we rarely hear anymore . vocals float up out sweeping electronic harmonies , singing words i don't comprehend but nevertheless feel glean meaning . strange , slow rhythms counterpoint dark ambience create rich complex moods . truly , just terms composition , this heady stuff . but when it comes down it , this still music composed film , this case , it music made film such good one . same film different music simply would not powerful or affecting it isham score . music married film story it tells , like any good marriage it manages elevate film something higher than it might otherwise . what mark isham music " crash " nothing short remarkable . he created music which evoke moods feelings all its own , but once brought together visual medium film , it suddenly takes more depth meaning , while adding depth meaning film well . music made because movie ... but end , it music made movie good it	1

it too damn good . dark side moon , perhaps more so than any other album rock roll history , tends liked because certain cool factor ( possibly tied nevermind zeppelin iv ) . every stoner wannabe stoner put this their top 5 say things like " it trip , maaaaan " , while making sure wear dark side t-shirt let everybody know they cool status . nevertheless , i must give credit where it due , this truly one most innovative pleasing works past 50 years . fact , only pink floyd album tops it imo wall , which i would rank single greatest album all time . anyway this album which absolutely must listened straight through , whole greater than sum parts . fortunately parts pretty damn great their own . evidenced fact half these songs heard regular rotation every classic rock station english speaking world . those hits include " breathe " , " time " , " money " , " us them " , " brain damage " , but sweetest slice this pie may " great gig sky " , where piano vocals complement one take you emotional ride thought impossible means mere music	1
i actaully made point not re-reading all reviews because all i remember them quot;' then something ... ' much better , quot ; short , i don't agree . i found electropura more emotion , songs seemed grow me more , but once they they really stuck i didn't get sick them . track 2 , 4 , 6 , 11 best my opinion . course , yo la tengo their worst , least , still yo la tengo ..	1

no need elaborate many excellent reviews precede mine . this among best performances this work ever recorded ( if it not best ; i believe it ) . reviewer hsu below intimated he almost cried upon first hearing this ; i tell you after almost 30 years listening mehta work his magic this symphony , i still cry every time i listen it . zubin mehta responsible number excellent recordings decca/london during his tenure los angeles . this recording comes us help even finer orchestra nothing lessen maestro work here iin states , though : his equally splendid holst planets one most collectible vinyl records there .	1

this second album , bates could very well become barry white country music . opening " long slow kisses " seductive style kix brooks , but lowered couple notes infuse white bedroom power . throughout his sophomore release bates displays level vulnerability emotional nakedness that uncommon among nashville modern male stars , harkening back provocative works conway twitty charlie rich . tone turns tender romantic playfully salacious " hands man " cover billy " crash " craddock " rub it , " album takes wry turn human foibles " good people " challenging daily choices " that'll get you ten . " bates original voice -- both sonically lyrically -- producer blake chancey makes most each backings include guitar-and-fiddle-driven twang , steel-lined weepers sophisticated modern country ballads . this fine example how nashville contemporary without losing its country ethos .

i just saw " little women " last night boston , opera house , incredible theatre , built 1920 , judging audience reaction , this terrific show much better road than it broadway , where it unfairly ripped ny times critic , ben brantley , didn't get attention respect it deserved . simply put , music wonderful , overall , several standout numbers , including " days plenty , " " some things meant me , " " astonishing . " wonderful number , beginning , which binds four sisters together , " our finest dreams , " lovely spirited . it very difficult take classic book make it into musical . certainly some depth characters taken out , but enough there carry story across , what more , show i attended , there many teens children audience , theatre offered free child ticket every adult ticket bought - what struck me how beautiful this story female empowerment - sisterhood . every time sisters seem coming apart , they remind each other their love support each other . what courageous , wonderful message ! mother , played beautifully maureen mcgovern , instrumental keeping home hearth together while girls ' father away war . real war going iraq , this production much more moving . i disagree many negative comments - music lyrics high quality , often moving , sincere , literate , emotional . this may not rodgers hammerstein , but what these days ? this closer old-fashioned musical than many - it heart class . it certainly better than something like " hello , dolly ! " which really bogus story only couple decent songs . here , you involving story , terrific protagonist jo , surrounded other compelling characters , whole world brought life ( production i saw stunning sets , costumes , lighting ) , passion clarity . fact i saw " little women " boston , just stone throw away concord , where louisa may alcott actually lived - where her home preserved - may something overwhelmingly positive reaction i this fine production , but listen yourself . music lyrics hopeful moving - it story our times reminds us innocence , sacrifice , good morals . it great show entire family - says something young girls positive life affirming . it all things really matter life it certainly worth few dollars - bargain , if you ask me - listen this fine cd . better thing catch show tour , where i predict it great success . you won't disappointed	1

alan vega martin rev waaay ahead their time . though their debut wasn't officially released until ' 78 ( even then , it predated debuts joy division , killing joke , cure , possibly even pil year or so ) , this guitarless ny duo around since ' 71 . anyway this album genesis post-punk/new wave , performed beat-up organ/synthesizer rev probably found back alley music shop , decrepit but chugging drum machine brings futuristic pulse eerie synths alan vega voice , which sounds like elvis detained guantanomo . very original , very creepy , very cool . material varies what would otherwise poppy tracks made slightly unnerving due their foreboding starkness ( girl , cheree , keep your dreams ) more haunting atmospheric songs ( ghost rider , rocket usa , che ) even one track sounds bit like primitive doors cut ( i remember ) . then there 10-minute frankie teardrop -- perhaps one most terrifying claustrophobic songs ever released , vega banshee screams punctuating narrative young factory worker who kills himself his own family out desperation wakes up hell . conclusion , its ominous synths vega sounding if he going insane horror around him , leave scar your mind . bonus material includes decent , if roughly recorded cbgb performance confrontational chaotic " 23 minutes over brussels " show which important historical reasons , i suppose , but isn't worth listening more than once or twice . first disc all you need know . bit primitive dated places , but still vital , influential , amazing fans genre .	1
most buyers aren't market complete mahler cycle one conductor , but if they , two bernstein contain many great performances . i've reviewed contents sixties cycle sony this later one eighties ( contianing many live performances ) dg , taking them one symphony time . but it worthwhile give sense strongest weakest parts each set . cycle #1 : general consensus performance sym . #3 one glories this cycle perhaps most inspired mahler condcuting bernstein disc . it all freshness discovery -- lb new mahler 1961 . sony 20-bit remastering makes original analog sound quite good -- fact , there no need comment sound quality these ny phil . recordings , none which bad . expect deep sound stage wide stereo separation columbia records favored time . bernstein also put his stamp sym . #7 such way no one would ever hear it same again . ' song night , ' this work dubbed , almost no life either disc or concert stage ( mahler champions prominent bruno wlater never performed it ) . not only lb prove this coherent music , he made unforgettable drama out seventh . this his signature recording work . two other great performances stand out : sym . #2 #4 , each rendered amazing imagination huge range emotions . accusation lb went over top second unjustified -- he often tender delicate -- but there no doubt he takes apocalyptic view finale . whatever you think his approach , he single-handedly revolutionized way resurrection sym . played . sym . #4 classic recording bruno walter , but lb added more depth , imaginaiton , excitement . lyric soprano reri grist come good deal criticism vocal finale , but i think she fits beautifully into lb overall conception . middle pack , it , we get lb readings sym . #1 #9 . he went conduct greater readings both works , especially ninth . person lb first real showpiece , but somehow sony sonics not up conductor vision . cse ninth , ny version would qualify outstanding performance if there weren't so many truly great ones karajan , bruno walter , james levine , barbirolli , among others . bernstein himself would add two greatest , both dg . i find few problems wiht sym . #5 , #6 , #8 first cycle . many critics all three great recordings . some reason , i never warmed up either lb versions sym . #5 , where once he manipulate exaggerate point spirit work seems lost histrionics . sym . #6 too brisk first movement let music expand its visionary potential , other movements bernstein seems less expressive than he could . eighth unmathced excitement joyousness part 1 , some listeners whole symphony remains exalted level . i find lb too studied part 2 , my attention wasn't held . he elicit very beautiful singing playing , however . it should noted this performance london sym . host fine english singers . end his life bernstein resisted deryck cooke completion tenth sym ., agreeing conduct only shattering adagio . which mahler essentially finished full score . bernstein reading ny phil . one most searing accounts this magnificent fragment ever received , equaled his later live reading incomparable vienna phil . cycle #2 : it should said right off dg digital sonics different league what lb got new york . even though several venues involved ( vienna , amsterdam , new york ) , many recordings under live concert conditions , dg engineers triumphed . they favor closer mike posiitons , solo highlighting , vivid sound stage compared their predecessors new york . interprettions , few exceptions -- most prominent sym . #6 -- bernstein not drastically change his views first cycle , some cases readings feel almost identical ( sym . #2 #7 , example ) . most interest centers works where lb clearly outdoes his younger self . top list i would put sym . #6 #9 . former he achieved one classic mahler reacordings modern era . his sixth slowed down 2 min . first movement , giving music room expand properly . andante heartbreaking heartwarming same time . finale explosion genius mahler part lb resonates perfectly . almost same said ninth , where conducting reaches deeply moving areas expression . finale drastically slow ( levine , similar devastating effect ) , which some critics find excessive . but it truism no tempo right or wrong ; everything depends upon drawn into world music . lb achieved great ninth but would surpass himself live performance berlin 1979 , also dg . almost great sym . #1 , which dg receives flawless performance packed excitement . i'm not sure lb reading actually changed , but superlative sonics spine-tingling playing concertgebiuw weren't matched new york . next thing ask where bernstein fell short his earlier versions . sym . #2 , #3 , #4 new york one kind , representing lb early most exciting explorations mahler world . their counterparts dg also strong , but i don't think they rise heights he achieved earlier . only sharp criticism i use boy soprano finale fourth ; musical he , boy too undeveloped capture what mahler intended . it should said , however , if earlier ny versions didn't exist , these would outstanding performances . i feel much same sym . #7 , where lb first recording set standard only two or three rivals come close , but his dg remake , which return ny phil . oncert lincoln center(as sym . #2 #3 ) , feels fractionally less overwhelming . it better sound , however . one symphony i can't compare fifth , which doesn't satisfy me either cycle . dg version vienna phil . convinces many listeners , some critics call unsurpassable , but i am not its wavelength . leaves sym . #8 , which bernstein didn't live record commercial release . dg reached into its vaults live 1975 radio tape vienna , although it flaws execution , including some rough singing part 2 , lb conducting superlative , more ocmpelling than his version london . paired this symphony 1974 reading adagio sym . #10 , also vienna phil . you'd expect , it inspired , searing reading , just like ny version . how ot sum up ? if money no object , i'd own both cycles pleasure bernstein unqiue inspiration . if i pick choose , i'd take sym . #2 , #3 , #4 new york , sym . #8 london , rest form dg cycle .	1
i got hooked beatles ' music listening my parents ' records child . i collected all their albums cd up through rubber soul . my opinion , i think rubber soul their best album . shows band height their career . their songwriting become more mature less teenybopperish . after rubber soul , their albums more drug-influenced less group effort their songwriting becomes sub-par , exception few gems here there . here those few gems , i recommend getting beatles 1	1

this album designed relax you . it very good job . doctors could prescribe this album releive stress ! it quiets down room , masking sound life outside . playing it causes your breathing slow , takes edge off cruel difficult world . environments produced least two " psychologically ultimate " albums including this one " psychologically ultimate thunderstorm . " i them ever since they first came out vinyl ' 70s . i lost my copy this album years ago , but managed find thunderstorm album vinyl . i then recorded it cd play it all night long sleep . i know ultimate thunderstorm not real thunderstorm , but white noise some sound effects top . i later found copy this album vinyl recorded it my computer , set up 10 hour playlist which simply repeats seashore play it help me relax , when i work home , when i go sleep . it more relaxing than thunderstorm because it doesn't thunderstorm sometimes intrusive rumbling thunder . accordingly , it gets played more than thunderstorm . it interesting see reviews below state psychologically ultimate seashore recorded night because there no gull noises . it my recollection it not actually recording or seashore , but simulation designed relaxing -- just like ultimate thunderstorm . this reason it self described " psychologically ultimate . " it sounds so good . comments show how good simulation it ! i've purchased actual recordings ocean thunderstorms they not relaxing . reason album works because it contains white noise . white noise sound contains every frequencywithin range human hearing equal amounts . this static type sound you get when radio dial isn't tuned station . pink noise variant white noise , except tonal balance different . this sound moving water makes . when used properly , it here , low level pink noise it very relaxing . because this album contains all frequencies , it masks noise intruding outside world . synthetic silence . they managed use technology record love peace ! it sounds better than real thing	1

brahms monumental piano concertos my very favorite piano concertos . therefore , i own many recordings same . nevertheless , this recording gilels jochum my absolute favorite ! it recording i've listened , least , once week many years . gilels jochum truly play these " monsters form " wonderfully capturing brahms fierceness well his tenderness beautifully . truth known , i slightly prefer 1st concerto-i know musical sacrilege . my god , gilels plays hell out work delivering those ( what i call ) " trills death " first movement such manner it still sends chills up down my spine no matter how many time i listened work . dgg superb job it transfer this " new " cd form . i owned original vinyl recordings ; however , i feel these cds give recording more depth sound far richer . if you want hear legendary sublime recording brahms piano concertos , buy these discs .	1
oh yeah .. music playing , isn't it ? i put this album listen it again so i could write review , then my mind started wandering . little later i remembered i supposed paying attention writing review .. i looked down cd changer , it five minutes into third track . might give you some insight into what kind music this . music that underwhelming enough you just randomly lose track it long periods time , even while trying pay special attention it so you articulate what you like dislike i t.t hat said , times when i remember it playing , i enjoy it . every song meticulously crafted creative sounds creative dynamics . understated vocal performance enhances handful beautiful collages mellow sounding synthetic instrumentation . few tracks border experimental side . but all creativity beauty caribou basic sound doesn't make up boringness emotionlessness songcrafting . die-hard indie fans who pray altar pitchfork love this album , anyone who liked his previous work under name ' manitoba ' . anyone else should probably skip it	1
i into explosions sky few years now they highly influential towards me my fellow band members writing . this album i find their most experimental ( apart " rescue " which isn't million miles off impossible get your hands actual copy , other than it free download off their site ) . this album my favourite alongside " earth not cold dead place " , every song this record extremely well written timed . song " you passed through this night ? " only song they recorded vocals extremely well placed dead centre album . classic formula progressive build up wall noise finally isn't better any other band , songs like " poor mans memory " back my point up undoubtedly . listening this album you see how it takes them so long write record each track/album ( sometimes taking up six months just write one track ) they composed perfectly beautifully . through my eyes what ever emotion you feeling before you play this record only added masterpieces songs , sadness , bliss , ecstatic ness , despair etc . this bands ability fuel emotions thought patterns quite astounding , i think every song personal effect everyone who listens it . album artwork sweet good use line , textures tone . ever person i recommended this band two come back me expressed nothing but glee towards their listening experience . so i say two you don't show hesitation towards purchasing this album .	1

i rarely write reviews music but feel i must share my impressions this cd . i long heard some my favorite singers praise songwriting prowess townes but somehow never got around buying one his records . i finally picked this one up because it two songs covered two my favorite singers -- lyle lovett- " lungs " ( among others ) steve earle- " tecumseh valley " . i blown away sheer beauty poetry every song this recording . other reviewers seem comparing this other townes ' records . i come different angle . someone who long heard townes sopken highest praise , i say this disk not disappoint influence me fill out my collection his recordings . i also say i am deeply frustrated i never took advantage chance see townes perform while he alive .	1
i originally heard many tracks ( more or less same remix ) best club hits 1 european party vacation . they sound just good here this amazing double-disk compilation . most tracks disk 1 lyrics making them more palatable mainstream dance enthuse while still keeping beat going underground clubber . you'll recognize vocalists like moby or disk 1 , track 13 , " i'll fly you " masterfully blended bleed into previous tracks . i wasn't tiered either disk or find beats repetitive or dull after party faded dawn . i liked it so much i took best club hits 1 downtown tokyo went 4-hour run . manic colorful energy this enormous city made unforgettable visual impact , perfected only its best club hits 1 soundtrack	1

auspicious title really say it all this collection trumpeter miles davis ' 1949 nonet dates . these dozen performances whole new school jazz created , former beboppers davis drummer max roach joined forces progressive composers , arrangers players such gil evans , gerry mulligan john lewis explore subtler moodier side genre vituoso standpoint . mellow results most part , there world complexity detail found here which no self-respecting jazzhead ( nor anyone else who really cares music ) afford miss . would often case throughout his long varied career , davis featured these sessions primarily player crafter atmosphere . despite brought sizeable combo ( which also featured such famed blowers lee konitz alto saxophone kai winding trombone ) together serving its nominal head , maestro takes only one half-credit composer these dates , bulk charts coming mulligan , lewis course evans , whose big band orchestrations provided miles his initial inspiration . these other gentlemen would also incorporate innovations realized birth cool sessions far more extensively into their respective subsequest careers than would trumpeter himself , thus marking this classic set recordings not only once-in-a-lifetime supergroup summit , but truly pivotal moment jazz history	1

just i walking onto my street school some guy passenger seat ford mustang leans out side yells , " happy 420 !! hey !! " ho damn i just cracked up knew england , approximately 1 square kilometer , there atleast 7 people smoking weed . anyways here almost unheard cd released sometime ago when green day just sapped up fame their-then newly released american idiot . however , order sap this review any shame , i won't talk green day anymore . what we treated here simply amazing . jari previously viking metal band ensiferum , but schelduled recording wintersun ensiferum tour during same date . jari forced choose his booked recording wintersun ensiferum . he eventually chose wintersun forced leave ensiferum behind . my case , smart move ... " beyond dark sun " comprised strong power metal drumming , melodic catchy riffs rounded out death metal vocals . guitar work jari pretty amazing . it flashy , technical , impressive without going over top . things really slow down better " death healing . " folk vibe well tact , but musically , things brought down several notches . jari guitar work really fantastic here because he shows audience he doesn't play lightning fast get job . it laid back you feel emotion he puts into it well . some tracks here tend get long , but because there so much going here it never gets boring . " beautiful death " just over seven minutes you would think this genre you can't or should go past four minute mark , but guys so talented composing there no time think boredom because tracks only get more beautifully complex multi dimensional . i think fans different genres music get into this because there so much offer . galloping riffs beats plentiful here . jari kai so talented handle each instrument great pride intelligence . there nothing lethargic or lagging here . this grade music . not too forget mentioning cover , which grabbed my attention way back late 2005 . view fallen man during winter unforgiving reign . sun shines brightly it , unable break void winter punishing atmosphere , wind , vibe . it very calm though , night fading absence life . one thing creeped me out most though orangish/brownish aura off right distance away snow corpse . something it just made we wish i wasn't night out woods if i saw it . i never liked too much black metal or very power metal stuff , but this cd emotion , skill , talent plundered within . two men handling responsibility create great music soul , mind , metalhead . not just any metalhead ... but one who appreciate culture mind eye represented not just this , but world only brings forth epic music	1

i am one those hard-core jazz heads really like footprints-live ! but ask most dedicated fans they tell you : wayne shorter great , music heavy - but its not particularly moving . not particularly energetic . i'll admit , footprints more than little cerebral . i went carnegie hall check out quartet live summer 2003 show interesting , but not remotely exciting . beyond sound barrier sounds like totally different band . while inescapable complexity still there , exciting forcefulness bubbles underneath everything . result effusive , rhythmically assertive sections overflowing action energy quieter more introspective section seem simmer potential energy . this wayne shorter we , who knew him , remember love . he leads this ensemble their radical sonic shifts plays beautiful throughout . rhythm section danilo , john , brian among best i ever heard live or record . they simply seem get it one . this album beautiful . its great see some musicians create such great music their golden years opposed usual sad story desperation lost skill . here wayne shorter - may he live long ( even still ) keep creating music we catch up	1

all fairness , i concede i late adopter sister hazel musical stylings . it wasn't until i saw them perform house blues hollywood back 2001 i found myself sold their brand rock roll . it wasn't long before i went out slowly collected all their cd . after purchased listened their album " live live , " i asked " lift " my birthday , thinking there no way they could go wrong . i mean every album i've gotten them , i've absolutely loved . how quickly i proved wrong . when i first began listening , i actually started wonder if cd case fact sister hazel cd . their sound totally watered down processed point where i haven't able find one track i like , all all , i feel little cheated . given their last real album -- " chasing daylight " -- wonderful , i'm loss words . while " chasing ...

first off , this great album . starting off album " one these days , " instrumental piece mainly showing off drummer nick mason skills , but also featuring catchy bass riff roger waters , david gilmour finger sliding guitar . next " pillow winds , " personally one my favorite pink floyd song ever . it very soft song features mostly pastoral lyrics . next " fearless , " sort southern rock , non-pink floyd sounding song , but highly listenable . then there san tropez , seamus . easily my least favorite off album . these two songs something you probably wouldn't expect pink floyd . then finally there " echoes , " 20 minute piece gives you taste what new pink floyd would bring . this song wonderful lyrics music . all together great album collector piece any pink floyd fan	1

i worshipped nellie birchmere 1/22 while she performed nearly everything " get away me " intermixed her new creations sony unreleased " pretty little head .

you really get full band feel throughout most this album they add horns many tracks well . only problem this album it their longest features most amount songs longer than their trademark under 3 minutes , even 2 minutes . there number songs here longer than 4 some just feel longer . certain point it just feels if album stayed past its welcome . i'm not sure if it . i like this album because it shows influence grunge few tracks while also staying true stylistic flipping song song they known . you might not make it through entire album one sitting , but it still high quality	1

early sixties there stir going musically brand new world pop rock music around area quiet cathedral city canterbury kent . catalyst all this , which wittily called " canterbury sound " , stemmed band calling themselves " wilde flowers " ( appropriate sixties misspelling like " beatles " " byrds " . ) formed 1963 band imploded 1967 , splitting into two major fractions , one side , more avant-garde jazz/rock fusion minded musicians , robert wyatt , hugh hopper , kevin ayers , going off form " soft machine " which later begat such bands '' gong '' , " kevin ayers whole world " , matching mole , etc . while other more pop/rock members richard coughlan , pye hastings , david sinclair , his bass playing cousin richard sinclair , went off formed " caravan " . four members caravan went off what every self respecting band much beloved era , went into retreat country " get it together " after year camping just outside nearby seaside resort whitstable , rehearsing every night nearby church hall , fighting off starvation , they became one tightest little musical outfits british isles without even playing gig . 1968 they snapped up american record label verve who released their first album caravan ( 1968 ) . which went completely unnoticed record buying public , which hardly surprising nobody heard them , there next no publicity verve went bust anyway . this all put right , when great enthusiasm giant decca records signed up our young heroes recording contract , not only prepared them their second album , but sent them out road get them public eye . this included not only playing any place would them , but such major events kraalingen pop festival rotterdam holland front 250,000 people same bill " pink floyd " , " jefferson airplane " , " santana " , " frank zappa " , admittedly " caravan " first second morning , so most people probably asleep , but some them must taken notice holland always stronghold " caravan " fans . caravan second album wonderfully titled " if i could it again i would it all over you " ( 1970 ) which released far greater fanfare critical acclaim . enabling band enlarge their following develop their natural talents . after six months road promoting album band ushered back into air london studio , under inspirational eye young producer david hitchcock record follow up album . when band came back out studio released results it waiting public they come out what many people consider seminal moment early seventies . " land grey pink " (1971 ) one most unique instantly recognisable sounds history rock , perhaps little whimsical some , but then lot its charm . those fondly remembered days innocence , anything written any member band considered band composition , songwriting royalties equally shared amongst band members , far cry today mercenary contracts . " land grey pink " , what you actually get three richard sinclair finest ever songs , one pye hastings ( according pye fair enough he written most first two albums ) , then side two vinyl album taken up one twenty-two minute opus " nine feet underground " which came five separate movements , four bridges , mainly written david sinclair , others linking all parts together , adding bits here there . album opens ' golf girl ' wonderful song love ( there no songs war , hate or politics ' caravan repertoire , just songs idealised life we all relate our happier moments ) richard sinclair future wife . this song should played regularly all pattaya many golf bars , no song could improve atmosphere bar more . " golf girl " followed richard sinclair song " winter wine " song fairy tales dreams which weaves perfectly feeling well laid down first song . next up pye hastings composition " love love you ( tonight pigs fly ) " . lyrics this very hummable song extremely naughty , not smutty , or crude , just enjoyably naughty . title track richard sinclair number nursery rhyme set music if sung children , including one most beautiful piano solo ever put down tape , lyrics would soften most jaded soul , " not leaving your dad out rain , those nasty grumbley grimblies , cleaning your teeth sea " songs final verse sung bubble you would sing six month old baby , quite delightful . albums epic " nine feet underground " stunning display exactly how well members caravan mastered their chosen instruments , including duel lead vocals pye hastings richard sinclair . obviously it mainly david sinclair keyboard fore through out , deservedly so he par any player his day , piano , hammond organ mellotron all given thorough workouts space allowed nine feet underground twenty two minutes , but this not detract jazzy bass work richard sinclair , melodic lead guitar work pye hastings , or rock solid drumming richard coughlan . there also room pye brother jimmy hastings come add some flute tenor saxophone . although albums not great commercial success time it never taken out print sells steadily this day , decca just released remastered version thirty minutes extra music , including two tracks recorded time but left off because time limitations , demo versions two richard sinclair songs , plus alternative ending " nine feet underground " where " caravan " prove they could rock hard any their contemporaries if they wanted . commercial failure album lead great internal stresses within caravan , david sinclair pack up his keyboards leave almost immediately , going off search his musical ideal robert wyatt " matching mole " . cousin richard lasted one more album , ' waterloo lily ' ( 1972 ) before he cast off roam afield musical world , later forming " hatfield north " , before joining " camel " caravan stumbled , but never match magnificence ' land grey pink " only reforming one off gigs nineties financial reasons . mott	1

" what you , " " anything , " make me believe " " there you " all sounded terrific " i love you " -- little pop-py country music ( i'd never huge country fan , but phase country junior high ) but still country ( la presence steel guitar almost every song ) . 1999 emotion martina mcbride surprised me extremely delectable combination perfect country-pop . definitely suggested buy any country fan	1

i stumbled across this album through blog sites which reviewed unknown , obscure or forgotten bands various genres . buffalo band formed early 70 australia , following blues hard rock tradition . their first lp dipped into variety hard rock blues styles , some which very good , but overall lacked cohesiveness . during their tour they went back studio cranked out this masterpiece , which straight up heavy hard rock . there not bad tune bunch , " sunrise , " what became their signature concert tune , " shylock , " one heaviest tunes come out 70s . how decribe it ? think steppenwolf vocals sabbath rhythm section , you come close . quick , pounding tunes 9+ minute epics , volcanic rock unheard 70 hard rock masterpiece criminally overlooked overseas . now cd , listeners chance check out one great australian rock bands 70s . bonus cuts include mono single version " sunrise , " live version " shylock " which sounds like audience recording -- not very good sound quality , but it gives insight their live performance	1
although it hard say sure which marley album best i say this one ranks very high my list . all songs based around same theme which holds album together making it complete listen . i could listen this album forever	1

exit(1981 ) . tangerine dream 14th (?) studio album . all throughout 70s , tangerine dream experimenting limits various keyboard , pedal synthesizer , sequence effects order create very atmospheric musical soundscapes . they weren't meant everyone , but each album proved interesting listen those who could get into them . every release would very few , yet lengthy tracks , aspect didn't really change much over years . phaedra(1974 ) rubycon(1975 ) peak output those type td albums , served first real means gaining cult fanbase . then force majeure(1979 ) saw group beginning incorporate rhythms into music , making it more accessible new listeners . this culminated 1980 tangram , which last album feature one giant album-length song . shortly thereafter , band created soundtrack movie thief(1981 ) , shortening lengths each instrumental making them more numerous , this would carry over onto exi t.t his album first one theirs more than four tracks , most them rarely go beyond 5-6 minutes . unlike most td output released throughout 80s , exit carries dark , futuristic feel it , it felt all over album . white eagle(1982 ) continued explore same vein , hyperborea(1983 ) went dark ambient sound cultural references , but exit probably pulled theme off best during this period . much style brought over their thief soundtrack score given its own breathing space exit . high-reverb keyboards begun incorporated heavily into melodies , although sounding very 80s maybe coming off cold some people , it works its warish 1984-type atmosphere . speaking future wars , first track ' kiev mission ' delivers 10 minutes melodic rhythm mayhem . story here this track written protest statement against cold war russia , many copies this album sold throughout country get message across . it starts out few bangs , then slowly synthetic drum beat pulses carries powerful theme around , shortly before unnamed russian girl vocalist whispers her plea against world war . this where whole " protest " theme came . it doesn't end strong it starts , but final part kiev mission shouldn't skipped . ' pilots purple twighlight ' run without any drumming , but carries awesome melody repeats several minutes . ' chorozon ' bit more upbeat positive sounding , could easily fit white eagle . i love title track slow , dark , powerful bass synth plods , complete memorable keyboard line rain sound effects . then ' network 23 ' surprisingly non-dated techno drum sequence which sort serves prototype some 80s 90s techno . finishing off exit outstanding ' remote viewing ' which goes through few different transitions its 8-minute span . first 3 minutes or so sort dark soundscape reminding fans td still held onto their 70s era extent , wouldn't abandon it completely over next couple albums . 80s td may somewhat less complex than td earlier material , but it still very well produced . then song ends lighter section repeats number times . replayability : medium . enter exit often ( pun intended ) . although album length slightly less than 40 minutes , each exit tracks high quality , so i'll give it 5 stars . it ended up my fifth purchase ( many ! ) td , but i would say it makes good starting point if you're first getting into 80s td . highly recommended . sad thing every album out print ! even remasters ! so don't expect find these stores . unless you know used cd shop happens get td albums time time , you're best off ordering them online . there many , many albums , but thankfully most all them found very cheap . either version album works . there no bonus tracks , volume difference only minimal , so buying any them ok . see also : -tangram(1980)-force majeure(1979)-white eagle(1982)-thief(1981)-hyperborea(1983	1

this great showcase american string quartet , innovation , vision , iconoclasm , all elements which we often overlook forget easily . but only elliot carter missing , that because he what ! five quartets now . inclusion first carter would rounded things out . earle brown here neglected masterwork . based graphic notation performers don't improvise so much given entrance freedoms within prescribed range . affect mysterious , haunting , also innovative wide pallette extended techniques , bridge , sul ponticello , plucking . we often forget traditional beauty cage engaged early part his career , forties . this quartet fine consummate example , soft , gentle lines , very sparce , transparent , also he limits himself few tones , tossed around various voices . structures feldman early work here , quartet treated one monolith sound , indistinguishable voices playing harmonics , cello playing where violin plays , same range . all feldman floating gentleness here well , perhaps too much times , like it overspends its welcome . crumb black angels classic , kronos takened this around block many times , crumb always works well programmatic agenda place , here he transforms quartets introspective consititution more drammatic focus . druckman well also works well program but here there none . he fine imagination sonoric structures , balance , but its doesn't seem amount much . wolpe one his best works . his creativity uneven , here violence charged motives he found place jump , reiterate , toss around environment high energy . wolff summer early work prior his metamorphosis into utilization political imagery comparison , this beautiful work , but cold , wolff also needs program , which he profoundly found , he alater quartet he wrote eighties more compelling	1

my title suggests this excellent compilation some very refreshing remixes people who appreciate both original versions open-minded enough understand how remixes need constructed so they beat-matched dj proper " big room " sound works so well clubs . needless say couple tunes " radio edits " -- why remix compilation used dj other clubbers label wouldn't include only 12 " versions beyond me . regardless pick this cd up b/c virtually all tunes amazing . particular bowie remix " live " crowd cheering effects which when played nightclub " trick ear " dancefloor into thinking everyone around them raving mad . course this then encourages crowd respond similarly creating even more powerful effect club , which something all dj love see ... hopefully , makers this excellent remix series refrain " radio edits " future compilations	1

dylan band made each other ; you tell this album , " planet waves " bootleg series album features his 1966 concert newcastle , england . ( disc , way , band drummer levon helm absent , he quit tour . ) i'd like correct something said previous reviewer , though . reviewer stephen . walsh says , " first time bob toured band ( then hawks ) 1966 , they booed everywhere they went . that because so-called " liberal " folkies actually reactionaries when it came their singers . they wanted them stick woody guthrie mode , beat up acoustic denim workshirt , talkin ' ' singin ' dust bowl . " actually , mr. walsh , tour you refer took place england , not america ; dylan wasn't booed " denim workshirt " liberal american crowd , he booed snobbish brits who still adjusting radical change sound . politics nothing it . dylan " electric " show met resistance previously " denim workshirt " crowd newport folk festival . but more ) really crappy sound mix , which made dylan his backup band ( mostly studio musicians who'd played " like rolling stone " ) sound like fingernails chalkboard , ) fact it newport folk festival . if you bluegrass festival , how would you react if , say , metallica showed up ? 1966 , " like rolling stone " already smash hit , " denim workshirt " crowd more than adjusted dylan new sound . so , let leave not-so-subtle rightwing attacks against liberal politics out it , okay	1
i saw great show fishlips bakersfield last wednesday : wayne " train " hancock . he sang like modern-day hank williams , great band , just jake stand up bass , johnny telecaster . wayne just strummed acoustic guitar , one stroke per beat , but always right pocket , his guitar holding down tempo while electric guitar filled when he wasn't singing , bass just kept beat going like crazy . it testament trio chops they could inspire someone dance right first song . they really crazy rhythm going it never let up . there not even drummer band . bass player always pushing beat , but perfect placement , intonation , which ain't easy fretless stand up bass . wayne played 2 hours , he let his girlfriend gina play few songs while he took break . i took opportunity get wayne autograph . when he got back stage he sang talked all counties where he incarcerated . quite few . i loved show , it prodigious display musical virtuosity . if you closed your eyes you could sworn it hank williams , yet he his own style , wasn't just clone hank . he what hank would sound like if he alive just little bit older than hank williams iii , his grandson right now . songs tulsa great , whether he live or studio , he sounds fantastic . wayne hancock refuses compromise his music , sweeten it , make it more commercial , anything other than play music he really feels deep down inside , make you feel it deep down inside , too .	1

this cd , essence , not same band you heard recorded masterful album becoming . parted ways kelli dayton ( now kelli ali ) , their first highly definitive lead singer , sneaker pimps underwent sort reinvention . while their initial sound extremely bass heavy , eerie , focused less guitar-range notation , bloodsport finds itself drastically less dark ambience . rather than sexy club mystique old , this cd offers much more cynical perspective . this rather successful venture : outset , songs like " kiro tv " " small town witch " driving powerful , enough traces trip hop left feed your hunger some dance grooves . where their original moody dance sound become less prevalent , however , it replaced tinges alternative rock post-grunge , especially case songs like " sick " . this daunting change sneaker pimps , who so capable their previous trip hop ambience . but it seems worked , because album quite coherent cohesive , rarely if ever falling into tangential realms sound past or future . there what i consider couple weak points songs " black sheep " " fuel " , however , which may simply because they represent unsuccessful return slow mood sneaker pimps ' older material . this setting , especially through chris corner voice , songs become dryly emotional such way bore death . say what you raw emotion brought corner voice , but electronic tracks such these unjustifiably slow moody without any emotional return listener . one feels certain blandness rather than sympathy ought desired . lyrics add dead-ballad feel , succeeding elsewhere album but these songs falling flat their faces . but spite these small failings , this good album . those who loved kelli ali bubblegum stylings sneaker pimps dark , rich trip hop feel she brought band probably disappointed , but this band deserves better than those expectations imposed upon wholly different lineup . look this recording coming separate artist it much easier enjoy , ultimately quite worth time .	1

this collection showcases wide range music various celtic countries . quality selections varies considerably : 4 yn bar knockout ( i wish their albums easier find -- i've no luck so far ) , poozies ( love name ! ) altan tracks great , quot;culloden harvestquot ; beautifully heart-rending . maire breatnach contribution lovely , too , i've subsequently bought both her albums . milladoiro selection pleasant but not typical their style , which lively point raucous times . other end spectrum , quot ; treequot ; puts me sleep , quot ; lone harperquot ; only so-so , clarsach accompaniment final track amazingly inept although vocal very sweet . this album great way become acquainted variety groups musical styles , but it definitely mixed bag	1

this best these sides sounded ever , period . it really treat hear early basie band lester young all its glory . sound restoration some these tracks just unbelievable , i check linear notes make sure these 1940 recordigs , because they sounded so different muddy/scratchy sound i grew used . linear notes alone worth price this box set . one full disc most unreleased live tracks , many lester young billie holiday ? you math . many people , i am not included , waiting full columbia sessions remastered , but me , this what i waiting many years . track secuence annoying , i still cant understand why not doing it chronological , but its just minor flaw	1
thelonious monk signed columbia records early 60's; because this , he able get his music out many more listeners than he could his previous labels . his first studio album columbia entitled monk dream , it introduced him lot new listeners who never heard him . criss-cross his second studio album columbia , it awesome follow-up . my opinion , it better than monk dream . monk quartet here : charlie rouse tenor sax , thelonious monk piano , john ore bass , frankie dunlop drums . this album mainly monk originals quartet , but there also two standards which monk interprets brilliantly . compositions monk always brilliant . his best songs this album dark jagged quot ; criss-crossquot ; , slow swinging quot ; pannonicaquot ; , sparse colorful quot ; crepuscule nelliequot ; , uptempo boppish quot ; eronelquot ; . but quot ; rhythm-a-ningquot ; also awesome because monk puts very original rhythmic melody rhythm changes , which bop cliche ' . also , quot ; think onequot ; demonstrates monk ability make one note interesting catchy melody . so , i would say this album superb showcase his compositions . however , this album demonstrates something else thelonious : his ability take standard transform it make it sound like he wrote it . main example trio performance quot ; tea twoquot ; . it starts bass playing verse only drums . then monk comes chorus , you tell he lot harmonic thinking this . standout his solo piano performance quot;don't blame mequot ; . monk one my favorite solo piano players becuase his ability make every song interesting different while still sounding like monk . quot;don't blame mequot ; darker more dissonant than original melody ; monk alterations here remind me quot;monk moodquot ; . bonus tracks here also interesting listen . two out three alternate takes , but quot ; coming hudsonquot ; monk song unorthodox metric structure ( sections 5 bars long , bridge 3 1/2 bars long ) . i see why this didn't make cut album because rouse sounds like he trying desperately hang odd form . but , composition sounds very natural very catchy even its unusual structure . i would recommend this album all jazz fans , especially those who haven't gotten much into monk . if you're only going own one monk album rest your life , own this one	1
picture bird gliding over surface water honest advertisement album could made . music once light graceful yet reality there lot work going here . back 1972 when this released , this album could passed " new age " except there no such phrase time . but return forever perfect keeping image ecm time high quality playing matched somewhat removed austere air . but keeping image " effortless gliding " these four selections tend put listener relaxed , light breezy mood . this saying something because if you actually focus music it quite busy jam packed twists turns distinct " latin " feel . chick corea keeps electric keyboard he used under miles davis . joe farrell uses both set flutes saxophones good effect yet it never strikes one this " saxophone " album . stanley clarke airto moreira give jazz lesson performing rhythm taste complete service band leader . flora purim ( never particularly one my favorites ) sings only two occasions during this album actually manages blend her vocals her band mates such way they become part brew rather than noise standing apar t.t hat all said , this still very much corea album stands one best he ever made . given somewhat " free jazz " past , corea returned popular appeal making record easy understand yet off beaten path . this over years led some dismiss return forever piece fluff-ear candy more " shallow " jazz audience . only thing one say this kind snobbery : " if it so easy you it . " but easy or not , it reward you each listening .	1

yeah , elo gets bad rap stuffy critics , but i'll hogtied if they didn't make some most delectable , silly pop since beatles started fighting . time one their very best later classics , full starry-eyed optimistic pop only jeff lynne could write , produce perform , well some comically enjoyable electronic effects synthesizers still sound great despite their obviously dated sounds . jeff elo loved making ridiculous concept albums , like eldorado tale universal dreamer romp through dream world , time tells fractured tale unwilling time traveler . opening vocoder monologue introduction , you know you're ridiculous ride , music certainly doesn't disappoint . " twilight " shines overdubbed vocal arrangements keyboard riff shamelessly lifted " baba o'riley . " " yours truly , 2095 " might album most ridiculously corny cuts , it all better it -- tale man who falls love robot who " iq 1001 , she jumpsuit , she also telephone . " throw top robot voice repeating " 2095 " " i love you sincerely , yours truly , " you've got shamelessly glitzy work pop art . " remember good old 1980 " kicks off surprisingly effective ( if schmaltzy ) " ticket moon , " operatic ballad . jangly acoustic guitars peppy rhythms power some typical elo rock " way life meant " apocalyptic " rain falling . " dance beats heavy bass thumps power similar tracks " end world " " here news . " " lights go down " one my favorites--it got great lynne falsetto chorus sounds like stolen version zeppelin " d'yer mak'er . " " hold tight , " its great french verses , last song album , cutting up futuristic vibe blast rockabilly . all all , there nothing time whole load substance , though lynne meditations future sometimes eerily spot-on resonant . it doesn't matter me , though -- elo all records like this . it catchy , delightfully tacky pop forged master craftsman who knows all right buttons push super hooks . it may tacky , but time still whole lot fun 25 years later	1

usually artists newely revised versions their old previous successful numbers after they washed out can't seem recreate magic they years back when they highly successful . well , theory may or may not apply vince guaraldi his 1968 release oh , good grief . though some years back , guaraldi highly successful his first version linus lucy , when it appeared cbs special , merry christmas charlie brown , soundrack special , perhaps many who so love guaraldi his music back early 1960 , forgotten guaraldi . popular side guaraldi . then there people who know guaraldi musician say he just getting his way more adventurous side himself , his albums more free , his experimentation various keyboards highly creative parts his career . said , this album revised cuts previously successful selections he earlier decade . perhaps , there great reason guaraldi update his old classics . guraldi here , re-does these tunes harpsichord electric piano . sound different new . though some may call music this cd very , " elevator , " i say it new exciting turn guaraldi his music . eddie duran gives life this happy bright quartet . his raunchy guitar sound compliments guaraldi assortment electric keyboards . stanely gilbert bass , carl burnett drums , perfect match guaraldi duran . though serious jazz fans may snicker this album , i love this album . guaraldi clearly didn't care stereotypes jazz . he his own man , just loved make music . albums like this examples . if you're looking cheerful , perhaps holiday album , try this size . you might like it . i sure !	1

first let me say this .. i love tim skold contribution kmfdm/mdfmk ... he great vocalist dark hard techno-ish music .. much needed break grunters like sascha , en esch , raymond watts .... i infact hate marilyn manson passion well ! sorry tim , no doubt you cool , but joining manson nasty move me . anyways , what great follow-up adios ... this also good because you arent really expecting kmfdm ... i mean sascha really only member true kmfdm blood this project .. so basically they covered their arses those nit-picking fans who would called this " worst kmfdm album " or said " this isnt kmfdm . " ... i personally think they should continued this direction ... maybe change things up little bit , but enough sound fresh excellent ... dare i say mdfmk should kmfdm new millenia ?... i mean really , worst part this album definately cover linear note design ... where brute when you need him ?.. well now kmfdm back while they arent what they used ... if they still mdfmk , they could excused easily . japanese version very tempting , but yet cd still incomplete because it still lacks " missing time . " so i would say stick us release simply because 30 extra bucks isn't worth it 2 extra tracks ... if it 4-9 extra tracks , i could understand ... i mean unless you live , eat , sleep breath mdfmk .... where accompanying 4 track ep when you need it	1

picking up this album/dvd passing , i did'nt know what expect . what luck , this very well-done set really showcases their fine body work . far dvd concerned , i blown away . some things editing perfect , use studio footage layered over top concert footage executed without flaw . sound , this one best mixes i've heard modern rock act yet . far buying this , you should buy this album " fun machine took **** died " alone . i highly recommend this anyone who bought album qotsa past , someone not used bands eclectic rock this might further alienate them . but , around $14 dvd album you can't really go wrong	1
matt nathanson one artists sadly likely never achieve mainstream success , but it not lack ability . truly talented artists rarely get noticed because they aren't hip or flashy don't get counter space they deserve . true music lovers get greatest thrills unearthing talented musicians sharing their work their friends . nathanson one those artists who i found through amazon " if you like this artist , try this " . paying $4.00 brand new copy through amazon used , this album worth every penny more . nathanson major label full-length debut album entitled beneath these fireworks , work showcases his interesting melodies lyrics his songwriter ability write songs capture attention . listen tracks suspended , sad songs , bare , pretty world you hooked . nathanson voice fits perfectly his melodies , overall result strong acoustic based folk/pop/rock album found firm place my cd rotation . matt philosophy : " able translate feelings emotions words , pull things out air create something it way turns me such amazing feeling . it so much better than any other feeling world . " sentiments music like , i am looking forward hearing more nathanson future .	1
average musicianship , derivative , reminds me some early 90 late 80 " art bands " , only " color number version " ... some catchy melodies , unsophisticated , attractive musicians should play well video ( especially bass player , but don't let her sing without pitch correction ! ) . it gets better more you hear it . they might make go it insightful management .	1
so lovely hear more this enchanting script score . casting seems dead . piano harp beautifully complementary very articulate . i highly recommend this recording . it takes nothing away original , but advanced recording techniques make terrific listening	1

westside connection united three west coast strongest rappers 1996 their first album , " bow down " . " bow down " great because it one hardest , most unapologetically gangsta rap albums released west coast since days nwa compton most wanted . while ice cube doesn't rap stunning consciousness or social relevance he his solo albums , he well surrounded fellow vets mack 10 wc , who display great chemistry play off each other verses . consistent word describe this album . every track just hard-hittin ' last one , threatening lyrics chanted hooks that'll you yelling them . production fights against reign g-funk taken over west coast nineties , using simple , hard drums synths create vibe reminiscent earlier west coast sound . while this not most original album emerge west coast , it great album ride around or play any time , it angry entertaining ride three west coast greatest , whole feel album great . i recommend it any fan west coast hip hop or 90s rap , it really underrated album . " bow down " great start , trio drops threatening , murderous lyrics great hook over awesome , super-tough beat . " gangstas make world go round " represents their style coast , it good production funny chorus . they throw their two cents east-west coast beef " all critics new york " , which followed entertaining " you like criminals " . " gangsta , killer , dope dealer " best beat album , ultra-rough song where they straight-up represent . " cross ' em out put " you chanting hook , guaranteed , awesome song . " king hill " " 3 time felons " , wscg ignites beef cypress hill would ensue next few years . both good songs too . " westward ho " humorous funky song dealings women , i really like it . " hoo-bangin '" awesome song , i love hook beat , one might call it classic . granted , " bow down " not most artistic or original album ever created , listeners looking " death certificate " or album nature should look elsewhere . but this album some most entertaining , roughest , menacing music hip hop ever offer . supergroup mack 10 , ice cube , wc rarely passed terms talent , this album shows why . highly recommended any hip hop fan	1

first thing first -- this release properly titled " perfect drug versions " -- original mix not this album . if you're looking , you've either got get rather expensive import copies this or " lost highway " soundtrack . gotten out way , turning this issue -- this five mixes track " perfect drug " , such folks meat beat manifesto , plug , nine inch nails , spacetime continuum orb . i'm really pretty ignorant dance/techno/drum-n-bass/whatever music , so couple these names mean nothing me . these all dance/house/dub mixes , i.e. vocals lifted them relegated either sample or repititious lines . direct , this isn't my thing . some dub mixes showed up earlier singles i found tolerable , but context rest material single , this nearly 40 minutes this sort stuff i don't listen , i find it nearly unlistenable . one one , some tracks certainly interesting , meat beat manifesto remix most listenable i think best beats arrangement . not really sure what make spacetime continuum mix , they seem ditched original song except written something new sampling line chorus once or twice . orb remix full good ideas , but falls short succeeding drags seemingly endlessly . i found both plug nin remixes irritating , quite frankly . so maybe i'm not best person review this -- if you like this sort thing , you'll probably like this more than i , but i find this painful listen . you're your own whether or not you should get this	-1

-hatebreeder- ... ahh , how this stands bodom greatest . or it ? me , pretty much , but ya this becomes question because -follow reaper- released two years later . all means they both serve well their endeavors , but i just personal connection -hatebreeder- more than -follow reaper- , but don't get me wrong it less superior this . overall mood , vibe , atmosphere this record doesn't seem stardom struck -follow reaper- , it feels more secluded secret . i find alexi scream/yell more bearable here than -follow reaper- , but it works well there too . thing makes this sound very well brooded use keyboards , which even though more elaborate longer than -something wild- , they appear only best times best lengths . different way putting this roy scythe . look out how obvious it looks like this , then look his scythe -follow reaper- post albums . it larger therefore broader than what seems little personal here . " warheart " springs forth subtle thoughtful words roy before it speeds through keyboard ticks aloft itself riffage . " silent night , bodom night " kicks off catchy lead while it trills itself miniature solos until both alex alexi duet until catch-up . keyboards lay good role until everyone else lays nice beat . guitar solo drives through while everyone keeps it loose . " bed razors " drifts above perfect keyboard volume , only till guitars pick up pace thereafter . goes into pretty standard riffage during verse occasional nah nah , nah nah , nah nah shreds . this one song i find this perfect melody sounds ultimately successful such speed . 2:20 , keyboards take part again briefly until devastatingly melodious solo , packed hereafter greatest keyboard comeback solo entire album . so much beauty intricacy packed 15 seconds ; janne master his art . " wrath within " starts incredibly fast catchy , much more powerful loud than rest . guitars bass take control throughout beginning . keyboards make brief appearance , shedding some melody finger-flinching playing . alexi then rips solo herein displays what only -hatebreeder- deliver , especially keyboard running down bridge , eventually finding its own time display power matching alexi . very sweet duet alexi janne before ending minute . " downfall " already deemed fan classic . picks up janne delivering nice solo , alexi alex grabbing pieces into what become fabulous masterpiece . this song never lets up any way . henkka his own little moment until alexi shreds his grandest stage solo . this essential melodic death metal album only common sense add your bodom collection if not so already . every track , even though i only mentioned half them , all carry their worth living here . -hatebreeder- felt like it didn't need achieve anything greater than previous , it just came out way . bodom improved what they felt needed improvement , why i feel -hatebreeder- comes out my top favorite	1
live album like this one missing bruce springsteen catalogue . more restrained than 3�-hour " live 1975-85 " , , well , better than " mtv ( un)plugged " , " live new york " really shows what evening out bruce band like . there aren't too many single hits here , rather collection fan favorites obscurities , so " live new york " probably not most casual springsteen fans . but more experienced fans delighted tough , sweaty , sincere renditions " out street " , " prove it all night " , " badlands " , " two hearts " many more , two new songs excellent , particularly " 41 shots " . uncredited " born run " tucked away disc 1 , it sounds great , filled urgency conviction . e-street band magnificent , springsteen vocals good , too ( even if he sounds little out breath couple occations ) . listen his almost-acapella rendition first two verses " mansion hill " , sincerity which he delivers solemn " american skin ( 41 shots ) " . this may not essential addition bruce springsteen catalogue , casual admirer find hits missing ( which they ) , but if you're fan it hard not warm this raw , sincere performance	1

if you like mountain you'll need this . any version nantucket sleirghride makes it cd worth buying . sure it 1/2 hour or so long , but it 70 afterall , hardly decade restraint or good taste . but there some tasty leslie west licks sleighride jams . great road music , if heading down cape or up vermont ski . you'll also hear great version quot ; theme imaginary western . quot ; even roll over bethoven sounds good , i never thought i'd say any version tired old song . contrary what reviewer said alan schwartzberg , he decent drummer . one whine not someone lineup , but i would enjoy what we here instead , lets face it , felix pappalardi isn't making anymore live recordings	1
i always big fan group alabama , this my favorite record yet . if you liked songs inspiration , you love this effort . it many more uptempo songs really striking its variety , stone country ( when it comes my time go ) , cowboy campfire ballad ( love lifted me ) , dixieland jazz ( down riverside ) , several other styles . very clever original takes some classic , fast-moving , quick-tempoed songs . i loved first songs inspiration , but this one lot more " fun " flows better beginning end . album even more spiritual than first theme which resonate many- fleeting nature life earth eternal joy we when we see our loved one again " other side .

somewhat misnomer album ben oscar " met " recorded together often before they made this one 1959 . but take nothing away great music they made together here . where often slow ballad tempos dominated webster recording sessions , we get brighter tempos throughout this cd . sunday actually wailer , it nice reminded just how hard swinger ben could . touch your lips relaxed medium swinger , light feather , but not all piece fluff . ray brown takes nice solo this track . bye bye blackbird also taken medium-tempo playing delicious all around . when you lover gone perhaps taken tad too slow , though it only plays just under 4 minutes , yet it might only feel way because other selections livelier than usual . this great album ben webster ( oscar too ) certainly worth acquiring	1

" roses " probably joni mitchell least recognized work merits rapt attention . other cds fabulous , close perfection , but " roses " delivers way positions it among best mitchell recordings . " blue " amazing , no denying . how could artist top it ? mitchell imposed exile herself after tremendous response " blue " reflection , study , time get out race . result musical jump carried maturity wasn't exactly missing previous releases , but discernable growth obvious . " banquet " , opening track , such panoramic view way people dealing complex society . again , fairly simple terms , but loaded meaning . " cold blue steel ... " chronicled crushing lament addiction ; mired squalor while unable resist . " lessons survival " seamlessly flows into " let wind carry me " , suite says lover family " i love you , please accept my essence . " " roses " provides first glimpse into mitchell disenchantment music industry ... it also open letter help her friends business cope fickle nature entertainment . " judgment moon stars ( ludwigs tune ) " thoughtful ode beethoven , talking him " condemned wires hammers " ... or , laymen terms , cold comfort his piano . intense , isolated study served increase mitchell doubt absolute truth , but it also formed basis overlooked masterpiece . incidentally , her first top forty single came this cd ; " you turn me , i'm radio " campy attempt appeasing djs who control fate much needed " hit " . it works , though , context light moment among serious depth .	1

mariah carey entered music scene 1990 her debut single vision love , she certainly caught attention millions . her brilliant voice combined excellent pop songs proved perfect formula success . her self-titled album mariah carey sold millions , ending up selling over impressive 15 million copies . however , it not until dreamlover released first single her music box album , i paid any attention songbird - yet she become one few artists , i always keep eye . vision love introduced world mariah carey , it obvious miss carey would force reckon . her debut single among my favorite mariah carey songs . impressive pop ballad haunting heartfelt offering . especially , part where mariah repeats lyrics , twice , wonderful - it almost functions duet . this carey , when she her absolute best ; vocally musically . there got way lovely up-tempo song problems world how , title suggests , there got way unite human race , resolving problems world . catchy chorus certainly most memorable part song . favorite no . 1 single , i believe , sad i don't wanna cry , which emotional ballad , showcasing mariah vocal range . up-tempo someday infectious beat lyrics stating someday former boyfriend regret leaving he come back , begging taken back . version album quite good ; however , version mariah unplugged ep album preferred , my opinion . vanishing power-ballad album . overall , it display mariah various vocal talents . '' big '' vocals tend overshadow song general . however , vanishing simply impressive both vocally production-wise . haunting lyrics mariah emotional voice perfect mix . all your mind starts off slowly , soon picks up pace , culminating faster chorus . song nice offering mariah acrobatic vocals near end song impressive . alone love bland mid-tempo ballad quite forgettable - except vocals miss carey . you found me mixture '' rock '' pop . it certainly inspired tougher sound . i , actually , like chorus . sent up above tad corny , yet it still enjoyable song . moving , prisoner up-tempo song mariah carey attempt rapping - she not very good job - yet you cannot help smile while carey her thing . unlike others , i simply not understand appeal love takes times . admittedly , it nice ballad but hardly no . 1 material nor mariah carey classic . each their own liking , i guess . mariah self-titled debut quite impressive , yet it not without flaws . there some mariah best material album : vision love , i don't wanna cry , someday , vanishing all my mind . however , her debut album also contains lackluster material : sent up above , alone love prisoner mediocre material , which keeps album receiving perfect 4 . said , album still treat listen due excellent vocals fantastic pop songs . overall rating : 7.5 /1	1

most part , deciphering where band hails solely sound band music usually impossible . sigur ros ' agaetis byrjun , ' you quickly learn expect impossible . iceland sons definitely make their mother country proud because within music you see cool weather sparse yet bountiful landscapes comprise their home . every song , emotion stressed rather than finesse , they execute it so well it hard not get locked . specifically " vi�rar vel til loft�r�sa . " beginning piano chords climax send shivers down your spine make your hair stand up your arms while simultaneously causing goosebumps erupt . it captivating experience say least . i gave this album five stars because i believe it sigur ros ' best work but mainly because it utterly beautiful . it icy sunrise ; dive into vibrant deep ; synaesthetic dream ; bow electric guitar .	1

i first saw tristeza 7 years ago independant music festival wayne , michigan . fest centered around hardcore punk ( generous handful fugazi rip-offs ) it lasted three days long . some point during day 2 , band dressed all dark clothing took stage didn't even address crowd beginning their set . this faux pas made me raise eyebrow . they started playing this slow , yet driving music i just stood there front watching ... waiting vocals kick . they never came . time ( all i listening thrash ) , my predictable add reaction this would've walk away bum around vinyl distros , but i didn't . i just stood there stumped my jaw dropped wondering where hell this band came . my tastes instantly expanded my record collection changed forever . this record , ways , doesn't stand up likes ( some)mogwai , tortoise , don caballero , directions music ... but debut full length young band ( bunch san diegons * one hometown boy * , coming scene where no one seemed slowing down ) its worth listen . hopefully it turn few their later , more mature material hopefully those few get chance see them live ... its worth it .	1

kind magic similar works ( 84 ) game ( 80 ) where there number great tracks several good tracks without ever rising unique greatness some their earlier efforts 70 . it keeps rock rediscovered works turns it up notch most tracks . 1 . one vision great song released stand alone single after live aid 85 . it appears here somewhat bonus track . 2 . kind magic one queen best . written roger , brian guitar work awesome . he got award queen it . 3 . one year love nice ballad written john . single some countries . 4 . pain so close pleasure good solid track without great one . 5 . friends friends also good track . nothing new offer here , just inoffensive run mill pop songs . 6 . who wants live forever great track . good orchestral work nice brian vocal intro . freddie sings all vocals highlander version . i would love hear full version . 7 . gimme prize heavy rocker ( one queen heaviest ) . would better if it didn't exerts movie though . 8 . don't lose your head probably weakest track album . run mill stuff , sounds bit like side track . 9 . princes universe one queen all time best . hard rocking unique . opening brilliant . solid album , but all their 80 albums it seems like they writing radio , not breaking new ground like their early days . i guess it sign times . ranking wise it sits middle below queen 2 , above night opera .	1

" shake you donkey up " raucous hoe-down ; like three brits overalls , drenched pig slop . country-blues guitar riffs , loud " yeee-hawww "' , even fiddle ! what more could you ask ? other highlights first side include bubblegum sea chanty " all you pretty girls " , poignant post-nuclear holocaust ballad " this world over " , " seagulls screaming kiss her , kiss her " , sort seafoam-molasses psychedelic reggae shuffle ( loaded lots eerie synthesizer effects great lyrics)side opens insanely catchy " small town " , pure brit-pop , ten years before blur made it popular again . then , there " i bought myself liarbird " ( nice little slam-dunk greedy manager ) , " reign blows " ( awesome caterwauling mess blues , pop , rock tons reverb other cool effects ) , " you're wish you i " ( cocktail jazz + dream pop chorus ) , " i remember sun " ( wistful , steely dan like jazz rock ) , deranged , tempo-shifting closer " train running low soul coal " . there also few bonus songs end ( or , middle if you earlier version ) . " red brick dream " best crop - hazy brew pea-soup thick dreamy psychedelia . don't give up after one listen . it loud , yes . but there lots great hooks buried this thing . one xtc most rewarding best albums . best songs : seagulls screaming .., i bought myself liarbird , reign blows , you're wish you i , train running low soul coal	1

i first heard amy rigby when she interviewed npr ; i driving i-80 . her album seemed like perfect soundtrack driving alone , night . she so impressed me candor her songs . i bought this album not regretted it least . ' don't ever change , ' ' break up boots , ' ' even weak survive ' continue favorites i'll listen repeat , over over . her lyrics smart , snappy , insightful . i've always sucker lyrics . rigby voice sometimes waxes thin reedy , but her lyrics more than make up what might musically lacking	1
i huge cure fan many years excited get this gift when my baby born . what i love this cd songs recognizable cure , but very baby friendly way . my husband dismay , i this cd going nonstop while since it quiet enough play baby fell asleep but also nice listen while feeding him . that not say my son won't also hearing original versions songs , but those 3am feedings , this just thing !!	1
this not compilation , but rather vastly expanded edition albert king second lp , " born under bad sign " , 1967 . one widely ( deservedly ) considered his best , tremendous collection soulful urban blues highlighted " crosscut saw " , " laundromat blues " , " years go passing " , " pretty woman " , " down don't bother me " , course title track . " king blues guitar " brings together all 11 tracks original lp , combines them six king excellent non-lp stax singles , including tough " cold feet " , instrumentals " funk-shun " " overall junction " , slow grind " you're gonna need me " , patented king molologues " i love lucy " " you sure drive hard bargain " . it must said this disc can't quite match 2001 version " born under bad sign " cd ( digipack ) far fidelity concerned , digipack edition notably louder , which nice , but difference not great , this certainly minor quibble . unless you already own " born under bad sign " , or rhino tremendous " essential collection " , this excellent way get all " sign " extra handful early stax sides no additional cost ! highly recommended	1

i forgot these guys . i recently rediscovered these cds deep recesses my collection . i took them out , loved them , suddenly big blues traveler fan again . then , just like , it gone . i tried listen second time through couple days later . i enough . it little miniature recapitulation my original relationship he group . there time ' 91 , i think , or thereabouts , when grateful dead this huge insurgence " jam scene " new concept . people all around me , all sudden , very into blues traveler . they played my college campus , then i saw them live couple times red rocks colorado . good shows . rolling stone ran cover story new bands coming up modeling themselves dead , far focusing unique , improvisational live performances allowing fans bootleg trade shows . if i remember right , blues traveler featured band new generation , phish , widespread panic , spin doctors getting their own blurbs . good ol ' ' 91 . popper singing grated me little , deep quavering vibrato changes notes so many times same syllable it just becomes waterlogged garbles . but he really amazing harmonica . he sings hard then he blows hard . personally , i liked old fat popper , not post-gastric bypass popper . that my own selfish thing . i like idea lovable loser guy getting stage coming alive manic intensity . but gastric bypass good operation , i'm happy him he lost weigh t.t hey're pretty fun little bit . but , then , like any small ensemble , their music started all sound same . popper harmonica still great , great when he collaborates other musicians , but songs got boring . but anyway . thumbs up , high energy live performance . this good music keep around deep your collection , occasionally bust out . key me little doses .	1
well i must say jayo felony really caught my attention first hit song his titled ( take ride ) what hit song . i remember when they used play radio all time . i agree it like other guy said it almost just good cronic . thinking only song i going like take ride i wrong i ended up liking whole cd if you should buy this cd well ... what you think i say anymore it just way it sounded ( take ride ) well it like oldschool sounding but then new rap same time it just grabed my attention all other songs became hit me even if not hits . buy this album hey i know it came out 1995 but who cares it still good cd !!	1
... you still need 1991 sony double-cd ben hur soundtrack ( now out print ) if you want two original , 1950 vinyl lp cd . i bought 1991 sony two-cd set years ago loved it ever since . i recently bought 1996 turner set what disappoints me some music soundtrack lp seems missing ; e.g. , prologue frankenland state symphony orchestra . there other differences well	1
i can't even remember where i got this cd , or when exactly ( early twenties kinda blur ) , probally when i hungry anything fnm . there plenty energy here , m.p. let it all out bag . anybody looking live fnm ( pre-angel dust)would'nt disappointed . some really sweet tracks . you would think brits would critical any sabbath cover , but m.p. gets them sing . live version " we care lot " (discovery channels dirty jobs theme song ) new kid spoof(does anybody remember them ? ) fnm always satisfied fans stage antics ( like snl)and it comes through this live release . but wait there more , " cowboy song " studio track guitar solo that'll blow your mind	1
excellent definitely " old school " . i played it our family reunion everybody stopped what they doing got into it ! jai4	1
years ago i lp " hawk talks " . i more into rock roll back then , but i remembered hawkin amazing rich tone years after i ditched my turntable records cd player . naturally , i started listening more jazz , i wanted some hawk my collection . if there better record out there , i yet hear it . warmth , richness elegance hawkin playing hardly seem like something this world . supporting cast stellar . reviewer put it well , there not wrong note this album . buy it , turn lights down , enjoy work master top his game	1

" o'connor " johnny appleseed suite " his 1994 orchestration children music he originally composed garrison keillor disc nominated grammy best children recording . friends john jarvis ( piano ) bryan sutton ( guitar ) join o'connor orchestra resplendent string journey . long exquisite lines provide us nostalgic views lost passing time . album closes mark splendid rendition " amazing grace " orchestra . his fluid , lyrical , emotional style truly heartwarming . i first became familiar marin alsop , emerging superstar conductor when she podium eugene symphony orchestra . her insight , instinct , intuition interpretation music resulted o'connor calling her " best friend american composer . " mark collaboration nadja spanned six years , he considers her " one greatest violinists not only our time but all time . " diverse musician who made considerable name himself many walks life , o'connor down-to-earth style which impeccable . salerno-sonnenberg second violin played more regimented classical approach . however , both excellent command techniques impressively play difficult passages responses complement each other . there occasional flurries notes rapid-fire commentary , but two indefatigable maestros fully understand each other . ( joe ross , roseburg , or . )	1
i never get tired this album . band tight they sound like they loving every second it . santana plays bottom his toes -- every note earned . after listening this , if you aren't grinning like idiot , you must not like music	1

production-wise this album get somewhat boring few tracks around halfway through , but cuts like " keep ya head up " " i get around " more than make up weaker points . " last wordz " features ice cube ice probably my favorite track . it shows 3 best ever it west coast trading mics easily over nice beat . you'll notice lot scratching here provide hooks production sounds more like it new york , but just shows pac versatility . 4.5 star album because weak tracks , but i'll round up give it 5 . definitely buy this well all pac other cds before death row " all eyez me "	1
if so , it probably starts here . what you when you've finished recording half your second album ( despite you your partner trying pull it opposite directions while dealing screwy studio equipment ) , then run out money your label refuse advance you any more ? klaus dinger michael rother chalked one up spite finished neu ! 2 anyway , presumably through sheer force . tracks doubled , stretched , compressed , sped up , slowed down , remixed voila - enough new material finish record . it probably wasn't intended avant-garde or new experient strange recording techniques , let alone spawn whole genre niche its own , but it amazing how things take life their own . if neu ! self-titled exploration simplicity repetitive grooves , this album sound idea gnawed gerbils , composted , half-torn apart , spit out mess tangled tapes reassembled frazzled sound engineer hurry his day off . i realize makes it sound like hopeless mess , but it not , really . off-the-wall wackiness what makes finished work so fresh intriguing . " super " closes album out nicely trademark smooth-chillin neu ! groove , but before we get there we hear part it once half speed once zippy hyper pace leaves your head spinning . " neuschnee " put through similar treatment get " neuschnee 78 , " i can't even tell what source " cassetto " , since track consists tape chewed up player . fun stuff . elsewhere some moments sheer motorik satori , creating more same blissful clockwork-cruising grooves first record . dreamy " f�r immer " alone probably worth price , traveling beautiful highway cruise trippy outer-space groove back again without missing beat . " neuschnee " " lila engel " ( even though it got some questionable vocals side ) similar patches ear-pleasing krautrock , which usually enough keep flow whole thing listenable amid freaky parts . neu ! 2 may my least favorite three most rarely listened ( it probably anyone who usually prefers sound finished product sound half-baked one put through broken paper shredder ) , but it got its own musical value all same . course " f�r immer " sheer aural perfection any way you look it . go neu ! ' 75 most listenable taste , then come here make your day little more surreal	1
alice cooper gem !! title track = hard rock excellent guitar work , heart pounding bass , heavy drums , alice his usual cut right through your body vocals .

" blue turk " = band jazzy side coming out excellent form . " my stars " = just close your eyes take ride through starry universe alice-you'll love where he takes you here . " public animal #9 " = hard rocker rebellious side-take teachers principals ! " alma mater " = alice gets mellow here-just substitute your schools name it everyones tune . " grand finale " = top notch synthesizer work rest band showcasing other areas there musical talent . all all , outstanding album one could listen over over again never get tired it !!	1

i own every monk album commercially released many others not , five spot recordings my favorites them all . here my opinion * perfect * monk quartet . each musician shining star melded into super creative force . they know this music . griffin soars sax , his bop chops impeccable . he knows monk changes inside out wrings breathtaking surprises out them . his playing more monk-ish than rouse , coltrane , etc . abdul-malik , probably most underrated if not unknown jazz bassist , similarly makes his instrument sing here . he backs group drive verve his true-to-monk solos among finest you ever hear monk group . roy haynes drums perfect drummer monk -- blakey ( except two genius modern music ) dunlop overpowered music , i love blakey -- because always musical roy haynes got inside subtleties textures escape others . his cymbal work unparalled ; his snare/bass drum interactions riveting , his solos creative , unexpected thoroughly satisfying . thelonious playing this disk awesome . his chords , his comping , his solos , his timing ... everything so right ! this recorded time when tunes fresh , lots left explore . none repetitive pianistic cliches monk seemed favor later his career . i could run down tunes track track extolling everything even measure measure , but suffice say together these men all their peak creativity there village late 50 laid down musical history these wonderous tracks . i listened quot ; actionquot ; quot ; misteriosoquot ; ( other equally great five spot recording ) hundreds times never tire it -- music superb . let this one into your head ! it demands repeated listenings . after while pay attention one musician time just follow him because there * artists * work here . sum , buy it you won't disappointed	1
ayla great role model young old . she only 18 she already so mature . this album obviously proves all . entire album awesome . i love enjoy every day each song cd exception two songs , but hey , you can't always get perfect cd everyone adore . i gave this cd five stars because i totally think it deserves it . well , actually lie because i believe it deserves six stars but unfortunatly that not one ratings . believe me when i say when you buy this album you won't regret it . you not wasting your money buying it . whole cd brings out her personality . ayla person who loves her fans actually cares them isn't all fake towards them . if you don't support her or aren't fan her this cd make you want become one . if you don't this album , you're missing out !..... big time ! :	1

cecilia bartoli her fans , no doubt , other reviews this site demonstrate , people who love her warmth tone her impassioned interpretations . these vocal qualities may suit performance conventions nineteenth-century repertoire ; however this anthology eighteenth century sacred arias result unhappy imbalance . problem , my opinion , one clashing calls attention , whose affect distract listener attention music itself . true , god counter-reformation worshipped ecstatically . true , also , i am anti-romantic listener , who grew up those early music performances which valued detached purity tone . this vaunted ideal means interpretation rediscovered seventeenth eighteenth-century repertoire ( it protested too much its rightness , alienated people- but i like it ) . however return subject hand- i find bartoli readings these crypto-erotic arias overblown self-indulgent . i guess this sort coloratura always offered chance bit ego let loose , even church- however when performance goes so far insist attention itself rather than deflecting attention music , i stop enjoying music . this recording not find balance big romantic personality eighteenth-century performance conventions , which , after 30 or 40 years self-critique , some authority . i disliked it very much . i am great admirer mark minkowski opera interpretations , which i think find perfect balance these opposing impulses warm cool- binary we trace throughout aesthetics through ages . here there overbalance favour warm ( hot , fact ) , which performers might argue just sort vivification baroque performance needs . not me . i gave it friend ( she still friend )	-1

much i love 1989-1997 albums closed out john lee amazing career ( healer , mr. lucky , boom boom , chill out , don't look back ) , 1970 hooker ' heat true crown jewel legacy . just johnny winter pure sympatico hand support guided muddy waters through his late-career blue sky albums , canned heat provides most solid driven backing i've heard jlh album . john lee full-blown crawling king snake mode here ... this album he not kindly " elder statesman , " he dangerous man , if you approach his flame , you get burned . late heat vocalist bob " bear " hite limits himself co-producer duties here , so musical dynamics come al " blind owl " wilson ( his final recording ) , guitarist henry " sunflower " vestine ( get ready thoroughly insane 11 minute " boogie chillen no . 2 " ) , antonio de la barreda bass fito de la parra drums . first 9 tracks john lee solo . wilson joins tracks 10 11 , full band backs remaining 6 tracks . make no mistake it ... you get cold chills when hooker bellows " alan ! alan ! blow your horn , baby !

this song i keep singing myself every time i buy falkner record ( exceptions holiday single , sub pop set ) , or any other offering any kind any member involved best band 90 ( jellyfish ) . i didn't discover them post break-up , oh no .... i fanclub wore advance copy bellybutton ( vinyl , yo !! ) out my college radio shift ! i also redd kross fanclub consider them higher than jellies ... yeah , i said it . so , you bet i raging " you-know-what " my pants this record !?!? import price long wait japan later , i am once again ... let down . it painfully obvious while where magic dust came within jellyfish , this testament andy sturmer greatness . i know , they weren't trying make jellyfish album , but songwriting here doesn't hold slightest flicker say , even beatnick beatch tune . if new cars hired faulkner ( who rhymes bad ace frehley spots ) , instead rundgren , they went songwriting ' door door ' , this would very close . this goes beyond " retro sound " straight into justin timberlake trying retro sound . better yet , if you actually enjoyed any duran duran last two records , then this knock your socks off .... fact , send me $30 you this copy . production quality my sincere love past these three guys , keeps me comitting this review one star	1
dandy warhols take lot guff posed , insincere , party-addled . irony thick enough use construction material : it fact this appearance pose pose . ultimately , joke not listener , though , post-velvets/post-13th floor elevators confections they ( regularly ) drop such casual nonchalance betray workmanship sensitivity songwriting tips its hand . this not band party-hardy dilettantes , but informed eclectic group talented musicians who probably stupefyingly impressive record collections . they ( wisely ) steer clear change-the-world soapboxing churn out anthem after anthem -- " 13 tales " their magnum opus ( so far ) . there weaker tracks , where pose overplayed , like " horse pills " or " solid . " but whole , " 13 tales " carefully balances bombast craft such seductive way lyrical foibles quickly forgiven cohesive , anthemic whole -- thick winking guitar snaky organ riffs -- becomes satisfying morning sex .	1

title this recording seems very misleading . although one find most cannonball most popular work ( songs ) here , title should read something like quot ; live cannonballquot ; , since entire recording live performances his band included joe zawinul his brother nat adderly . truthfully , cannonball very little original significance capitol records . said however , i still enjoy this recording very much . two featured bands really cook , cannonball his soulful , playing best , digital sound production michael cuscuna typical par excellence . so despite misleading title , i consider this strong recording good introduction adderley music	1

i found tracks flow well into each other consistent tone . many tracks seem other cds so person may want check their cd collection see if there too many duplicates . it feels like journey lot places moods when you listen them . there lot textures sounds rhythms makes repeated listening enjoyable . bass tones not feel harsh compositions not feel " dark " or " heavy " . many them feel happy or mellow all them feel danceable . because tracks flow seamlessly into each other , i found i could not repeat one track without getting parts surrounding tracks or if i downloaded mp3 natural pauses tracks would more noticable ( i heard some players solved this though ) slightly interupt muscial flow . i found lot trance cds this same characteristic . it means cd best played whole rather than just playing few favorite tracks	1

ok metal fans , music fans alike , this moonspell latest spell , called " antidote " . it really good album , i'm really impressed . first off , i'd like say i'd heard this album way before i actually bought it , didn't think it great , but then i heard " everything invaded " , i hooked . there so many great songs here it even hard me believe i skipped this one year ago when i could've it sooner . antidote fantastic album filled dark , brooding , sometimes beautiful music . it begins classicaly heavy " above men " , which course fan favorite . this song heavy hell , fernando nothing but grunts screams this one .... it excellent . next exotic " lowering skies " which features fernando clean vocals really cool drum beat . chorus raging metal fest . next melodic " everything invaded " , amazing chorus ( when i say amazing , i mean amazing , it just fits so perfectly song ) . up next mosher " southern deathstyle " , which really some great sections where you mosh . believe me , i know haha . next title track , which really some great guitar parts it , awesome lyrics . i love this song , however , something better awaits . " capricorn her feet " amazing 6 minute galactic metal song . now when i say galactic don't expect some star wars metal song , but i mean this song some really trippy moments . now i don't drugs , but i'm sure those great time listening this one . chorus great , fernando vocals shine this one . however , parts i am most talking ending minutes , also include solo ( which one my favorite solos i ever heard , i play it ! ) some great synth work . next up odd but still interesting " lunar still " , which this .... strangely enough , sinister moon feel . it sounds like something you would hear game doom 3 ( come think it , i should try playing this song ! ) . it unique 3 minute intro odd intergalactic synth sounds , then turns into crushing intergalactic sinister doom metal song . " walk darkside " trip back normality this one , really just hard rock doom metal song .... if makes any sense . it really fun listen too . end this cd consists " crystal gazing " " we eternally sleep it " , strangely , i just consider these two same song , i don't know why , but i . anyway , " crystal gazing we eternally sleep it " really good ending this cd , sets mood new moonspell which i hear may appearing sometime 2005/2006 ? anyway , next time your cd store , you see moonspell , pick this one up ... it great musical trip	1
all contemporary country singers emerge nineties , trisha ( remains ) my favorite although not much . this album typical , containing many great songs some finest songwriters around ( annie roboff , jamie o'hara , al anderson , don schlitz , mark sanders , dianne warren , carole king , allison moorer , victoria shaw souther among them ) , yet requiring several plays really appreciated . many songs ballads but there some faster songs provide variation . trisha always careful select songs mean something her . i sense lyrics her personal life difficult time she recorded these songs . album opens there goes my baby , reflective ballad former lover . maybe second track , never let you go again , sequel it getting second chance . net comes song cheating , ain't way i heard it . powerful thing ( up-tempo song love ) country top ten hit . after this comes superb ballsd , love wouldn't lie me , but it . if prove love lies next song , wouldn't any woman , end relationship . contrast , i'll still love you more finds trisha deeply love . heart like sad song woman ( not trisha ) who cannot find lasting love whatever she tries . i don't want one relationship difficulties . bring me all your loving ( allison moorer song ) missing somebody wanting his love , not flowers . allison own version eventually appeared one her albums ( hardest part ) two years after this album released . album closes title track , which excellent duet garth brooks . this not strong overall some trisha early albums but it album very high quality no trisha fan should without	1

angels dirty faces slightly softer edge than matm spectacular previous release , more seduction , but most important aspect new album it shows excellent songwriting exhibited previous disc no fluke . one great song after tumbles out angels , nothing that less than inspired anywhere sight . matm proven they wonderful job covers , but manda original material what shines most brightly here . beyond-catchy songs like say anything , lipstick , simple things boys boys remain one head long after last note played . incredibly fun , catchy songs what allow this record great , but effect listener wouldn't same without strong band back them up . manda plays very capable bass , joe damage offers sharp , very well-crafted guitar work , newly added elias dubok plays important role keyboards , powerhouse drummer mark slak helps bring everything together prevents sound ever getting too soft . there some obvious 80 influences here , but sound not retro - manda co . definining their own little homeplace today musical world . manda marbles want take us all sonic joyride . i can't imagine why anyone who enjoys rock roll would want resist .	1
minus blondie , debbie harry released four solo albums . even best them ( " def dumb blonde " ) spotty , frankly , " koo koo " horrendously over-rated release . album represented here its two main singles , " backfired " " jam moving , " frankly , they most dated sounding songs album . other hand , when songs producer sympathetic , best these singles rates best blondie .

i writing review legendary masterpiece 2-cd set album entitled " all things must pass " quiet one , legendary ex-beatle , george harrison . this 2-cd set album originally released vinyl cassette 1970 infamous capitol records label . i purchased very first release this album cd matrix or id number cdp 7 46689 2 . i also purchased this new 2-cd set release included attached dvd matrix or id number cdp 7243 5 30474 2 9 . if i hear any new information concerning this legendary album , i edit this review so you consumer get best most accurate review possible . my opinion , " all things must pass " should rank one all-time great albums . this album so underrated ! this album life general ! when beatles broke up 1970 , george such pain breakup he wrote songs it recorded them into album . i am aware george came into his own right developed into great songwritter during beatles era but i must confess i never knew george it him write such powerful lyrics ! george must learned alot john lennon because he write powerful lyrics just good john if not better . since there so many song tracks review this album , i am going list briefly review my favorite song tracks their exact order follows : disc one ( 1 . ) " i'd you anytime , " ( beautiful acoustic song ! i love this song . ) ( 2 . ) " my sweet lord , " ( beautiful acoustic song ! sounds like gospel song ! ) ( 3 . ) " wah-wah , " ( great song ! ) ( 4 . ) " isn't it pity , " ( this extremely powerful song ! this song evidently message other three ex-beatles ! lyrics so much meaning we truly realize what we take granted . listen these lyrics closely , its rude awakening ! i never would believed george could write such powerful lyrics ! great song ! ) ( 5 . ) " what life " ( great song ! ) ( 8 . ) " let it down . " ( beautiful song ! ) disc two ( 1 . ) " beware darkness , " ( warning george ! beautiful song ! )(5 . ) " all things must pass , " ( beautiful song powerful lyrics ! i love george lyrics this song ! this song also so much meaning ! this song makes you think twice taking life granted ! rude awakening ! ) ( 11 . ) " plug me , " ( george saves blistering rockers last ! this song ( 12 . ) " i remember jeep , " ( 13 . ) " thanks pepperoni " ( 14 . ) " out blue " kick a*s ! musicians george his band all-star line-up ! too many list but includes such legends badfinger , delany bonnie band , members procol harum , eric clapton , ringo starr phil collins . what great way end this legendary album ! ) this album true encyclopedia gospel rock ' roll ! great album indeed ! there many other song tracks i could easily listed reviewed but you see , this album great collection worth purchasing he or she should own part his or her collection . this album true treasure cherished many years come . closing , george harrison never really got recognition or his due when he beatle or solo artist i think its time george finally received due he truly deserves . its just too bad we lost george so soon ( november 30 , 2001 age 58 ) despite youngest beatle . i believe george still so much give us . george john gone , there only two ex-beatles left ! i'm sure we all now realize beatles reunion never happen again ! r.i.p. george harrison 1943-2001 . thanks reading my long review i hope you enjoyed reading it much i enjoyed writing it all you . i also hope you read all my other reviews near future when time permits . beatles forever ! george harrison forever ! long live rock ' roll ! rock out always take care . j.l.	1

james horner expert capturing essence what emotional movie , breathing musical life into it . i found deep impact , movie , almost unbearably moving sad , yet infused throughout nobility human touch differed movies action-bent , like armageddon . i knocked out my seat deep impact , it caught me surprise . after rushing out buy horner soundtrack , it became clear me perhaps main reason i so moved because this haunting poetic score . there mesmerizing quality evolution one , all-mighty theme , finale still leaves me weakened state sadness euphoria . if you liked titanic score , you love this one	1
i admit i don't many nice things say mnemic . sum up , they're metalcore/nu-metal band hat also combine fear factory vibe , uh , ' tributes ' meshuggah . truth they're not really good fear factory their peak suggesting they're same league meshuggah like saying usa mexico good football soccer france brazil . their riffs nothing write home either , some which sound like blatent meshuggah ripp offs without odd time signitures poly cross rhythms . fact , i don't really understand meshuggah comparisons all . overall vibe nothing like meshuggah clearly people missing just how complex some their rhythms compared rather simple generic ones found scattered throughout this album . vocals decent . they get little nu-metal-esque times they're far original , but something tells me mnemic weren't out reinvent wheel anyway so i'll leave it . bitching aside , they some plus points . first off , they're very tight solid . not especially technical , so one could argue its not hard tighten up what they're doing comepared other , superior metal bands , but they're tight what they which good start . overall sound album isn't all poor played loud volumes when drunk fellow metalheads its enjoyable album . its just its not exceptional all - contrary its rather mediocre these ears . maybe i'm just too picky snobbish metal these days but i just don't feel need praise bands making unoriginal bland metal	1
slayer " show no mercy " , my opinion , their best album . most say " reign blood " their best . i think hellacious album , but doesn't measure this . i think its metal second greatest album all time . every song good , no slowing down this album . great , fast , thrashy riffs , awesome lyrics , scary vocals underrated tom araya , make this metal milestone . ratings : 1 . evil no boundaries-15/10(great opener)2 . anitchrist-12/10(metal classic)3 . die sword-13/10(kinda reminds me halo 2)4 . fight till death-12/105 . metal storm/face slayer-20/10(best song cd)6 . black magic-10/107 . tormetor-8/10(weakest album but still great)8 . final command-18/10(awesome lyrics)9 . crionics-9/1010 . show no mercy-13/10(nice way end awesome cd)overall-140/100 awesome album	1
tom jones ' sumptuous , expressive voice simply astonishing this collection includes many my favorites ... fact only jones favorite mine missing this compilation " these hands " ... all others here : " thunderball " , " ( it looks like ) i'll never fall love again " , " delilah " , " green , green grass home " , many more delight ears give one sense nostalgia days when music like this popular . tom jones burst music scene 1965 " it not unusual " written man who " discovered " him , gordon mills , then , road paved gold jones mills , 1971 , paul anka " she lady " gave him his biggest u.s. hit . this terrific compilation ( only one song i don't care , " daughter darkness " ) , sure please welsh wonder fans . sound good , total playing time 37'26 , not including many times i hit " repeat " button hear his thrilling rendition " ( it looks like ) i'll never fall love again " .	1
there'a warning cover : this compilation " classic " bad co . lineup ( burrell/kirke/ralphs/rodgers ) , dubbed " original " band . make point , cover resembles one their very first lp . so , forget find tracks brian howe era ( 1986 beyond ) , this only goes 1974 1982 , plus 4 new tracks recorded 1998 ( what hook ! ) . anyway , compilation far superior than 10 6 edited long time ago , curiously time band coming back mid-80 different lineup . here you plenty classic tunes popular album tracks ; 3/4 their self-titled debut album included ; 3 songs burnin ' sky lp say " present " here ( not even one song album appeared previous compilation ); there alternate version " right your woman " ; what most interesting , respectable bunch b-sides forgotten tracks rescued vaults see light -and cd player- again . these tracks , one shines above them all " superstar woman " . i don't understand why it hadn't included their debut album , such strong song great melodies , straight drumming intense piano ... 4 new tracks , lead-off single " hey , hey " , its hummable chorus positive vibe , should #1 hit charts ( it some countries ) . its energic guitar intro cowboy feeling , " hammer love " best 4 . musicians still deliver goods : boz burrell enhancing bass lines heavy sound mix , exact beats simon kirke , never out place or overloading tunes , fine riffs licks mick ralphs , paul rodgers ' voice , although darkened bit , passionate unmatchable . i give this double cd 5 stars rating because it lot virtues compilations this kind should imitate : it combines greatest hits classic non-single tracks , satisfying casual fans ; includes non-lp songs , also keeping happy hardcore fans ; 4 new tracks cherry cake . beside music ( which sounds great thanks digital mastering ) , cardboard contains jewel box cool , accompanying booklet plenty rare band photos memorabilia , family tree , lyrics all songs . maybe some complain there aren't more songs some unreleased tracks desolation angels rough diamonds albums recording sessions , but overall i think feel this double cd complete affair . next thing we wanna hear our hands double cd compilation " other " bad company anthology ( 1986-1995 ) . their record company word , hear fans !	1

i bought original 2lp set when it came out 1971 or 1972 waiting get cd . it great hearing body soul afro blue this cd set . coltrane incredible . no matter what he playing , it always works . i wish i could say same pharoah sanders . he not my taste this stage his career . i liked him later his solo albums , but coltrane he not same level musically rest quartet , my opinion . often , coltrane creates mood his solo , only sanders completely destroy it his solo , my opinion . i didn't think sanders listening what rest quartet playing . spite sanders , cd still must long classic coltrane quartet playing	1
anticipated full album german group modeselektor reveals their humorous side beginning tracks but moves into deeper electronic/trance/idm feel . popper bboy , i got album looking alternative break beat . some tracks very industrial feel similar autechre , while others more ambient like something off boards canada album . definitely worth purchase if you're into autechre , boards canada , kraftwerk , aphex twin , mr. oizo , etc . this album ease you into funky-ish groove hold you there ---	1
i wish there more than just this ep . four great songs easily best three kiss-styled eps melvins put out . dale seems only one who took his homework seriously . buzzo gave us one good track , one funny track , couple eh-so-so tracks ; joe wanked ; dale dug down deep pulled out something dark , melancholic tasty . somewhat reminiscent acid king , though little less " stoner "	1

i am not biggest celine dion fan , i'll actually go record say i haven't liked anything after let talk love . however , my mom used own this cd i heard it so much i ended up buying my own copy . bombastic steinman production " it all coming back me now " ( which heard full version ) , beautiful sentimental " because you loved me " poignant " fly " fantastic " call man " " all myself " , where celine made one most dreadfully sappy 70 songs her own made it good , soulful ( think mariah fans attack celine " too vanilla " , whatever ) " declaration love " sexy " seduces me " ... celine dion able something big voice divas usually incapable making ... album consistant . even though all together , i think there more mariah whitney songs out there i like , neither them ever delivered album killer consistant this ( i say these two because those perhaps biggest rivals celine age fanbase ) . i think whole world became celine fan after this album . i also like " let talk love " too but album pales next this record . it deserved it grammy imo	1
john rutter made substantial changes previously most-performed version faure requiem when he recorded this . he went back version 1893 so , rather than using more famous , more heavily orchestrated later version . one difference violins sanctus transposed up octave this cd compared way which they played later requiem . i find this recording beautiful timeless , definitely not over-orchestrated . me , faure great contribution requiem he showed firm refusal judge other people well compassion face death . this went against beliefs catholic church time , which emphasized hellfire brimstone , faure heavily criticized putting little mention he could get away regarding day judgement . this compassion shows his work makes it comforting rather than frightening . it called " lullaby death . " i also enjoy other vocal pieces , particularly ave maria cantique de jean racine , which probably familiar many people who not really aware faure career . these songs pure , clear sound which not ruined through excessive orchestration . my opinion , john rutter fantastic job this material , it one my favorite cds	1
bo-didley names says it all ? best collection his music . i recommend anyone who fan people who tried bo style like stones , eric burden etc ., give listen this . excellent investment your music collection	1
al . sure delivered us his final album which some moments but not appeal lot critics back ' 92 when changing guard going away new jack swing movement into g-funk movement . album starts off promising hits like " right now " , " ui " , " natalie " . then i see where album hits snag uptempo songs kind outdated its time . now devante jodeci produce some uptempo tracks al b cousin kyle west howie tee but it just not appealing . then album gets back track my favorite song album " die you " , this song very underrated because if you really listen message , it talks loving your mate unconditionally you would literally die them , me true love . then next track " i'll never hurt you again " great slow jam really talks true love . last track ok but nothing get excited . me this poor-man version " diary mad band " jodeci dynamic slow jams but below average up-tempo songs . this cd still worth take chance you buy very cheap your local record store	1

most motion picture scores , unfortunately , bland when removed visual stimuli movie images . not so this magnificent howard shore penned masterpiece . like movie which it written , score spellbinding provocative . each individual piece complete unto itself , never failing deliver its unique impact . score its entirety takes listener fantastic passionate journey emotionally aurally . what sets this artistic work apart countless others unique styling offered howard shore stellar guitar playing grammy winning classical guitarist sharon isbin . her subtleties " billy theme " evoke anguish deep emotional conflict leonardo dicaprio portrays onscreen . such powerful performance rare any recording , unheard soundtrack or score . g.e smith slightly processed electric guitar adds yet dimension . i generally not buy " movie " music , but this cd i own . it fabulous recording worthy critical listening	1
honestly , there only two songs i really love album , but those two themselves earn whole thing 5/5 . revolution gets 5/5 . why ? it just plain rock . not any kind metal , punk , alternative , nothing . it rock ' roll , straight up . it well . rescue me gets 5/5 well . it chords flirt every so slightly metal or hard rock , but it retains melody truly great music so it hits hard sounds good doing it	1
this cd sucks . it doesn't contain good music ; it only contains crap . only exceptional tracks quot ; main titlequot ; quot ; farewell , quot ; both which danny elfman . these two tracks what make this movie great . including stupid rock music into movies promote them just stupid . i would rather buy original score this movie than this garbage	1
this cd . maybe you should drive stunt my favorite bnl recordings . they more mature than gordon , but still pleasingly playfull . bnl refreshing experience compared so much loud , heavy , hateful rap-metal-punk bands these days . these canadians continue prove their musical lyrical talents . this good buy . 4 stars	1

i born after all songs this album released ( 1987 ) , but i definitly appreciate each everyone them . i first introduced human league via vh1 i love eighties . there i downloaded " don't you want me " " lebanon . " simply put this become one my favorite records . i'm only 18 , but this solidified my mind my love new wave music . all tracks different crisp sounding original dare ! record . each different mood all extremely enjoyable . second half cd comprised remixes love dancing album . this second half just enjoyable first different reasons . course since songs only remixes they can't new . wrong . yes , they comprise central elements original recordings , but they each journies into soundscape original each song . dance techno enthusiast they would very easy fun dance rivialing many today " top " remixes . buy this if you even heard liked just one human league song ; buy it even if you haven't .	1

i start saying i'm big early heep fan . up until high mighty i thought they could no wrong . they often said poor man deep purple . maybe . but heep much more diversified than purple . they both same lineup : guitar , bass , keyboard , drummer , singer . however , heep 2 lead singers , background harmony vocals , hensley doubled keyboards guitar . now , this live album . my opinion , uriah heep never really transferred studio live very well . often times , guitar mixed down point sometimes difficult hear . background harmonies sometimes out tune , harmonies one characteristics uh set them apart alot other bands . said , this still best live album i've heard heep put out . all classics here , even though most them don't sound much all like studio versions . that not necessarily bad . they intensity ' feel ' them gives impression they hoot performing them . i've seen this particular lineup concert 2 times they good . but , personally , i prefer live version song very similar studio version but heep you don't get . specifically , guitar solo studio version look yourself 40 seconds wah-wah pedalling send chills down your spine . live version kind watered down . also , intro lay sounds like they leading easy living . it fools me every time . overall , nice live album . 5 stars song selection 4 their performances .	1
i really enjoy norah jones . this cd so bad i still haven't listened whole cd . who wants listen same 5 songs preformed 5 different ways ? most remixes hip hop , not really norah jones ' style . best part this cd cover artwork . if i could i would give this cd 0 star	-1

461 ocean boulevard first studio album eric clapton recorded after he kicked his heroin habit . unlike tortured passion layla , album finds mr. clapton still not completely satisfied , but more positive outlook . album opens blistering take traditional song " motherless children " follow-up compassionate " give me strength " . his remake johnny otis classic " willie hand-jive " loose fun . " get ready " , he duets his backup singer yvonne elliman ( pre saturday night fever ) simmering , bluesy number call response vocals backed driving guitar riff . he practically introduced bob marley white rock audience his percolating take marley " i shot sheriff " . combining song reggae roots rock , mr. clapton made memorable song became his first only number one hit . ms. elliman backup vocals provide backbone sweet " let it grow " . album closes burning " mainline florida " which mr. clapton lets it all hang out . 461 ocean boulevard his first number album re-established eric clapton musical force .	1

don't get me wrong , peter gabriel truly gifted artist . i own each every one his albums . but i think it remains said , until now , his music could really use more cowbell ..	1
like countless others , i started listening woody guthrie recordings fan bob dylan . i'm happy say listening woody enhanced my appreciation him singer songwriter , also made me appreciate dylan more once i aware what elements guthrie influence he incorporated into his art which he expanded upon . i highly recommend purchasing this entire collection ( rather than just one or two discs , since they're available individually ) essential dust bowl ballads strong foundation woody guthrie collection ( not mention his amazing autobiography , bound glory ) . what you say 4-disc retrospective such prolific , improvisational songwriter ? my reviews i generally talk some specific songs , but there so many here i'll try not get boring long-winded too many details . discs each loosely-based different theme named ( 1 ) " this land your land , " ( 2 ) " muleskinner blues " ( 3 ) " hard travelin '" ( 4 ) " buffalo skinners . " although track sequencing isn't too strict , songs each generally fall categories patriotic , interpretive ballads ( mostly classic folk covers ) , topical/working class ballads , cowboy ballads . you'll find out , though , these labels aren't too exclusive , woody writes sings pretty much anything you could imagine , he sure good it . legend goes , woody wrote anything he could get his hands , composed songs fly ( freestyle rap anyone ? ) , so this historical document also quite amazing considering asch told guthrie he could drop recorded whenever he wanted . these off-the-cuff recordings not only represent broadness woody musical vision , but also pretty accurate representation spontaneous singing he while wandering country , living ( hearing first-hand ) lives characters his songs . what great songs they . tracks range classics you may or may not known woody wrote sang ; " this land your land , " " grand coulee dam , " " pretty boy floyd , " " so long , it good know you , " " hard travelin ' , " " car song , " name few . what makes wealth music here extraordinary hearing woody come up social anthems , dark ballads , heartbreaking stories , hilarious blues time time again . although folk music simple ( fans more complex chord changes instrumentation may take few listens appreciate what it woody music makes it so classic ) , magic storytelling lyrics . some his talking blues like " talking hard work " " mean talking blues , " example , laugh-out-loud funny , especially repeated listens . some people griped sound quality , but i personally wouldn't it any other way . scratchy , old-timey production fits perfectly , analog sound probably accounts much woody timbre . i'll bet it wouldn't sound half good if recorded digital . woody signature flat-picked acoustic occasional harmonica makes most accompaniment , although cisco houston few others make appearances singing playing acoustic instruments , so there not really any complex overdubbing danger covered up quality . woody voice , it like warm blanket or familiar sound grandfather telling story . even though it simple , there warmth magic , subtle wit there all time only woody could pull off so genuinely . liner notes only add quality this treasure , providing info each song , well great , informative biographical info . taken together , this really academic historical document both paper cd , but it also real pleasure listen . you might guessed , i highly recommend this collection , but if you don't any guthrie recordings yet , i'd probably recommend shorter dust bowl ballads first , since it not daunting size or price . once you're hooked , though , this next place go . i hope you take time discover why woody such legend , treasure this set years come	1

xtc fourth album easily their finest xtc : influental touring rock quartet . they hinted greatness this album 1979 masterful drums wires . let examine shall we ? lp opens their best-ever opener , " respectable street " - dig suburban prentiousness . song may fact their most rockest ( even word ? ) song ever . followed chiming dual guitar attack " generals majors " which succeeds making cold war paranoia ultra hummable ( or whistle-able if you ) . possibly colin moulding finest single , it also features now very popular disco/new wave hi-hat action inluenced terry chambers . " living through cuba " cold war paranoia dance . " love first sight " , fine moulding single , perfect psychedelic new wave it echoing refrain , quirky chorus , stuttering guitarsolo always inventive drumming chambers . " rocket bottle " " buring optomism flames " both upbeat , optomistic songs some great , great playing . formersounds like kinks backing paul mccartney - tuneful but rocking . " no language our lungs " may fact one xtc all-time greatest songs ( feat itself ) . " i would made this instrumental " repeating " way " parts still give me goosebumps . ouch ! " towers london " provided xtc yet english folk ( folk folklore ) classic . " paper iron(notes coins ) " points where people like damon albarn blur learned few tricks . it subject working-class struggle common subject matter but this song above beyond otherslike it we listen band truly working . " sgt . rock " , hit single england fun catchy fluff complete mock hard-rock riffs . " travels nihilon " possibly xtc most haunting song . repetitive thundering drums spooky bass line create atmosphere not accomplised often popular music . it sounds like stumbling upon tribe early homosapiens foggy shore or something . bonus tracks nice well " somnabulist " interesting exceptional . " don't lose your temper " nifty throwaway ( jam rick buler handclaps what it worth ) " smokeless zone " sub-par moulding contribution . rhythym section moulding chambers height their powers . dave gregory andy partridge dual guitar attacks . album went u.s. top 40 spawned five , yes five singles . melodic , atonal , inspired , inspiring great/complex/clever arrangements . complex intelligent rock never sounded so easy except maybe band sixties . what they called again ? oh yeah beatles	1
although this album criticized csn imitation ( what fans often seem forget ) , it still very good lp , standing famous test time . there something magical song horse no name , most imitative song whole ( it could really neil young ) , makes it one best songs history . but other song i find moving pigeon song i wonder why every lover this album seems agree it weak song . text way db sings it ( not far cat stevens style ) create malaise . sorry but me , it other highpoint album	1
title suggests , this ice-t return . but return exactly what ? it could viewed either return forefront hip-hop , or return his roots , end 80s style hip-hop . while i'm sure ice thought former , resulting album doesn't quite achieve any two " return " targets . there two very notable changes ice-t style here . first lyrics department . while ice intelligent witful ever , he toned down his verses lot . gone almost uncontrolled aggression " home invasion " . instead we mostly slow mid-tempo tracks , most which deal topics either rap game its rules , or warns against gangster . this change quite understandable man turn 40 years old . lyrics mostly good point . though i must admit i still find 2 love ballads here somewhat out place . other notable change music . it advanced basic beats noises towards more rich soundscape . most tracks , especially slower ones , attempt develop feeling uneasiness tension , most times it works . so why i think this album one more step way down ? because taken whole , it lacks focus sense general direction " o.g. " maintained perfectly . not single time i cringe , realizing this or track just filler ( " forced dirt " , anyone ? ) . turn off might old-school feeling whole attempt , which simply sounds out tune general development rap . clearly ice-t wanted put himself back game . but much i respect his previous efforts , more often than not i vision man his late 30s who generally unsure what kind music really works 1996 , his songs often sound strained entirely forced ou t.t hat said , long time fans , which i am one , this generally nice little album , worth listened occasionally . but it far mandatory purchase	1
i am not really fan live albums , but everytime i listen this cd , i feel like they performing just me . it great cd	1
you may determined other reviews this cd , juan diego florez controversial artist . high tessitura , athletic vocal agility , penetrating vibrato , mr. florez voice might find more fans europe than us ( where dramatic arias verdi , puccini wagner more popular than jaw-dropping vocal fireworks made rossini famous ) . opera fans who introduced rossini difficult now rarely-heard music 1980s through such great artists mexican tenor francisco araiza ( e.g. , through opera film ' la cenerentola ' jean pierre ponnelle ) , florez may shock . mr. araiza voice deeper , darker , more ' masculine ' than florez voice yet possessed same amazing agility range . however , juan diego florez worthy praise recognition . he ' easy top ' much like pavarotti , high notes avoid bone-grating ' slide ' up high cs db other tenors used rossini operas . young ( barely 30 ) , mr. florez time grow into his powerful voice . we should all hope his talent recognized wider audience lead new , more authentic recordings rossini rare difficult operas such semiramide , tancredi , ermione .	1
well , mariah got it this great cd shows it all ! her label mate co-star columbia/sony years , regina belle ecellent , solid , always uncompromising , engaging consistent performer who churned out some really nice tracks last 18 years . i'm into rnb/soul/hip hop , but i no problem saying i own this really good set songs . her music always ground-breaking , adventurous extremely good . " baby come me " her signature track , most people favourite regina track . it perfect track one which she always able say " classic " . this track get played radio 20 years time . " whole new world " track 90 feel which catchy but it track # 3 " so many tears " which i love . it perfect song someone you love , lyrics what most us think situation . it tracks like this makes regina true star real woman something say . " make it like it " " if i could " two soulful tracks . latter more hearfelt deep mother her child . great stuff . " what goes around " classic regina . it her sophisticated sound . " show me way " heart wrenching number , which some fantastic sax riffs , track which only her voice could make sound so real . she jazz cover-medley classic marvin gaye donny hathaway tracks " save children/someday we'll all free " . its spectacular effort , unmatched masterpiece you won't skipping it . song " whole new world " killer track went number one , really put her firmly map . it still gets lots lots airplay today many years come . i've nearly forgot mention absolute classic duet " all i want forever " . this track superb when it released all those years ago - it still today . regina never superstar status some ( just think somebody like janet jackson or celine dion ... my modest opinion , she outclasses them far !!! ) , but i think she really doesn't care happy making good quality music people enjoy . this set superb listening 74 minutes pure , sublime delight your heart soul .	1
... then this album you . everytime i rough day work i pop this one into my car stereo my way home all my troubles seem vanish within seconds . it softer side coltrane but ooooh so sweet tranquil . how anyone listen this album not touched it i never know . tyner amazing ! if you run out valium or xanax , then this could your next choice . but careful though , because it just addictive ! " coltrane w/ johnny hartman " , this most romantic recording jc ever produced leader it also my wife personal favorite . i listen first song " say it ( over over again ) " twenty times row still not get tired it . what amazing quartet tyner , garrison , course great elvin jones drums all backing up coltrane . this one truly something special anyone new jazz or coltrane this would good place start . if this doesn't get you hooked , nothing . so , kick off your shoes , pour yourself glass wine ( or whatever else you prefer imbibe ) , draw lights down low , grab your honey let music lead you promised land . i hope you all enjoy it !	1
ruben blades " mundo " tasty cd . i compare ruben blades jet li both professionals their craft they both top their game . true , some pure salsa gone moments during this beatiful album , but not really . his band excellent musicians there moments when priceless grooves achieved . ruben blades trascends this album your average performer . his lyrics universal their theme if there one message this : we all human race , where music concerned universality human spirit all matters . kind album first you might mildly dissapointed critical . but once you take tour again these jewels start shinning i decided ruben blades far too talented put out bad cd so good know . he belongs special group artists always satisfy listener , always deliver quality . there , 4.5 stars " mundo " 5 stars man himself . long live ruben blades !	1
let me preface saying i don't own any other luna album -but i love this one . title line suggests , i bought this album whim used cd store seven years ago ( i'm still playing it ) . band sound sort hard describe ; imagine more nasal lou reid singing over warm , quot ; so simple it genuisquot ; , slightly country-tinged pop tunes occasinal wry sense humor similar stephin merrit(the magnetic fields ) add shoegazing sensibility ( reverb touches , multitracked backing vocals ) dean wareham brings his former band galaxie 500 you luna . sans any musical pretention or quot ; look how witty i amquot ; lyrics , luna shines almost every song via liesurely , unemotional vocal delivery , solid quot ; songsmithingquot ; wareham so-effusive-it's-painful guitar solo bits outros ( it not jamming however , no song exceeds 5 minutes length ) . highlights include , quot ; i want everythingquot ; quot ; slidequot ; quot ; slash your tiresquot ; . review i read newest manic street preachers album described it , quot ; intimating emotion without kicking you groin . quot ; i think this applies lunapark well . even when wareham croons : quot;you've got me bad situation/and i want youquot ; soothing , neutral tone he always uses belies words underneath . great	1
metal health ( 1983 . ) quiet riot third album . formed mid-late seventies , early metal group known quiet riot released two albums japan . unfortunately , group split up , guitarist randy rhoads joined first incarnation ozzy osbourne band . fellow quiet riot member , bassist rudy sarzo also joined little bit later , unfortunately , tragedy struck rhoads killed after releasing just two albums ozzy . sarzo decided reform quiet riot . he rejoined former vocalist kevin dubrow , recruited guitarist carlos cavazo fill rhoads ' slot . they also recruited replacement drummer , frankie banali . 1983 , band released its third album , metal health ( this their first album america , but all actuality it their third . first two released japan only ! hope i cleared up . ) let get what matters - album . this classic metal way it meant experienced . there reason this first metal album top charts - it flat out rules . kicking things off title track . it band second biggest hit , what excellent song it . subtitle implies , this song you'll want bang your head . dubrow vocals top notch , nothing less . cum feel noize , band biggest hit all , cover slade song . this better than original , added guitar solo gives cavazo chance shine ( i'm so sick people saying rhoads better than him - they're equally good . ) don't wanna let you go perfect medium hard rock power ballad this track . some reason , this one reminds me triumph tears rain , that good thing . once again , dubrow couldn't sound better . slick black cadillac originally released quiet riot ii album ( released only japan ) , but band decided rerecord it cavazo guitar . this sounds like " seventies glam rock meets eighties hard rock " , it ultimately makes very pleasing track . love bitch slow hard track nothing short excellent . this cut solid proof - hard rock doesn't need fast-paced good . it also proves rock roll songs word " bitch " title always good . breathless one fast frantic rockers so many eighties rock bands tried their hands - this one best ones ! yet again , dubrow vocals steal show ( especially chorus . ) run cover hard rocker , similar several eighties rockers . this excellent track , though it doesn't quite top last one . next up instrumental , battle axe . this track gives cavazo chance shine , he . however , i've never huge fan instrumentals , this probably weakest cut here . however , it still very far bad . let get crazy , if poison cared more their music than their hair , they might sounded little something like this song sounds . i know i've beaten this statement death this review , but dubrow vocals excellent ( there no such thing overpraising this guy . ) closing things out thunderbird . don't let title fool you , this softest ballad album ! basically , it slow soft . every one these eighties metal bands needed some power ballads , this one best . end , it classic metal masterpiece ...... but it doesn't stop there if you bought remasted edition ! remastered version , addition expanded liner notes , you get two bonus cuts ! danger zone , previously unreleased , one band many fast frantic rockers . though normally i praise dubrow vocals only dubrow , true highlight this track backing vocals ( chorus) ! you must hear this track appreciate it . live take slick black cadillac not whole lot different than studio version found earlier album , but it doesn't . bonus cuts make remaster obvious choice if you don't album yet . metal health stands one crowning achievements eighties metal , good reason . it ironic dubrow sings line " i really wanna overrated " title track , because this became first metal album top pop charts ! i don't care what anyone says , this album worthy overrated ! no fan eighties metal should without it !	1
i am reviewing simply best collection after buying listening all best collection . although i owned simply best since it came out 1991 , it not great compilation all best two reasons : 1 . ) it only catalogues tina music recorded capitol label 2 . ) it doesn't reach all way back earlier years tina career ( exception river deep , mountain high ) . nonetheless , it provides good sampling tina biggest hits 1983 through 1989 . everything here let stay together which marked her comeback , what love got it , we don't need hero , typical male , what you get what you see , best , look me heart , steamy windows plus you get four previously unreleased tracks including my favourite love thing , which just rocks ! if you're so-so fan tina music , you may satisfied this compilation but if you're die-hard fan tina musical catalogue , pick up her most recent collection called all best which includes just all her hit singles . let hope tina more new music come . this can't end her career - it only simply best so far ...	1

some people spoke above liking king their positive stance ... i always liked them their realistic stance . they talked things both good bad didn't hide behind platitudes , they real people real problems they want better than they . it great see this honesty , yes , there very small amount language this album , yes , it deals few adult concepts bit escapism , but it honest it admits freely there better ways it wishes it could live up them . it retains hope . those white towers this album might seem like downer , but those us who _are_ depressed deal stuff like this , it light darkness still it one close enough us reach , unlike stupid feel-good rubbish completely unbelievable detached real life . too many christians live denial lie both god themselves everything perfect , refuse even think or talk real problems . king honest real worth so much more because they _share_ their tribulations trials they men trying make it through their lives . enough ... musically this album different what i expected , very john lennon guitar pop type stuff most places . melodic catchy vastly different most places kings . i really like it happily play it more my friends or just leave it background while we're doing something else . not all kings accessible ... hmmm ... maybe this could stepping stone help get someone into king more ..	1

bill cosby very funny this cd . clean , funny . three tracks noah worth price cd	1
i find myself wanting push past first two songs , jump right into " we " continue there . but instead , i take breath listen what band wants us hear . i'm not dissapointed . well , not completely . " ceremony " what one may expected hear come first appleseed cast last album , two conversations , gritty instrumental track following epic low level owl albums . me , two conversations wasn't hiccup , but it didn't seem like natural progression . llo may just too high bar set ( many said ) . now digested peregrine while , two conversations seems natural progression band it relative simplicty more straighforward songwriting combined all came before into this fairly great album , peregrine . this album completely unique mind blowing ? not really , if you've heard appleseed cast before , but this damn good album . " sunlit ascending " " peregrine " probably two standout tracks me , though i like everything this album . weakest point comes second song " woodland hunter ( part 1 ) " it seems bit contrived , but " part 2 " saves it later album giving first part purpose . i given this album any number people who never heard appleseed cast i yet find someone who dislikes it . obviously , some blown away others jump around hit high points , but it hard call this bad album . appleseed cast , peregrine isn't completely original , but their songwriting strong throughout resulting what probably their most accomplished listenable album yet . highly recommended	1
tell you truth , metal my least favorite genres . i hate slayer , judas priest , linkin park etc ..... im more into hip hop/funky type stuff . but friend mine said i litsen this cd , this unbelivebly awesome . so i figured what hell . he right , these guys blew my fu**in ears away . hangar 18 one best songs i ever herd . these guys such amazing guitar solos im actually banging my head like crazy it . got one best rock band 90s not just i think theyre one best rock history . thats all i got say ... cop this albu	1

i really love this cd . it great number her 1927 recordings which display annette could get true jazz feeling going her singing . she wasn't just sweet little singer all . she up jazz which evident " don't take black bottom away " uptempo " ain't grand glorious feeling " " wh o-o o ?, you-oo , that who ! " she also good torch songs such " song ended " . annette hanshaw integral part 20s 30s roster female vocalists . she friends great helen kane annette good impersonating helen style singing . while these songs fun , it best let helen kane sing like helen it joy hear annette sing her own inimitable style . this cd i treasure i highly recommend it . annette recorded 1926-1934 . it too short career but she left many grand glorious recordings	1
it quite easy me forget judy incredible acting talent , i lot non-movie performances my playlist , so i tend get wrapped up her vocal performing talents . however , this gorgeous compilation best her movie songs , i also remember what incredible actress judy well . unlike singers actors today , who either one well but not other or can't either one very well , judy supremely talented both . this compilation covers her entire movie career , pigskin parade , which she made loan 20th century fox , her final movie , i could go singing . within period 1 hour , 18 minutes , 53 seconds , you hear her transition sweet-voiced teenage belter deep throaty-voiced woman she would become later life . you also hear she never lost incredible talent singing . even though sound her voice changed over years , it youthful exuberance stripped away alcohol , drugs , just living tragic life , emotion intensity could not stripped her voice . this collection proves i t.t here not single dud these cds , sound quality excellent . many older tracks some hiss them , well occasional sound anomaly , which expected . however , everything beautifully remastered sounds incredible . liner notes packaging period also incredible . very informative include lots great pictures . i might weird , but i actually like cover art . it nice whimsical , although far away , or pics made really small , it make her look like something dominatrix . * now there side judy you thought you'd never see . ;) * but cariacature actually quite cute , i just think it cute cover . judy would sadly pass away six years after last tracks this compilation recorded . although she may dead physical sense , long her films audio recordings like these available public , judy never really die hearts public , she never forgotten . there only one judy garland , there never like her	1
after six years co-founding member mountain heart , 26-year-old fiddler vancleve stepped front center lead his first solo release . though his mountain heart bandmates on-board , this clearly vancleve record , serving producer chief songwriter , adding lead vocals several tunes . beyond his regular mates , he brought complementary players sessions , including guitarists rob ickes bryan sutton , banjoist ron stewart , vocalists ronnie bowman sonya isaacs . there plenty vancleve bluegrass roots heard here , including tight multipart harmonies hot-picked instrumentals , but there also moodier newgrass tunes diverge standard canon take country , celtic , jazz other influences . this rich solo debut established group player . 3-3/4 stars , if allowed fractional ratings .

i never quite realized how many great songs buddy holly recorded his very short lifetime until i got this cd . rave , it doesn't matter anymore , every day , true love ways all fantastic -- yet all current radio stations only concentrate his famous quot ; peggy suequot ; cut . such low $$ amount this cd , you can't go wrong	1
not much add what already said . it just quite amazing they self-produced this gem . there some delicious production here . perhaps they didn't need george martin come all following year . not too judgemental " muskrat love " - just because ct made it mega-hit later . listen it again open mind . it lovely arrangement too . i'm curious its inclusion though . warner need promote potential radio hit ? it only song not written boys , but they make it ' theirs ' ( not unlike " head heart " previous album ) . it saddens me this effort not commercial success it deserved . there not bad tune this record ( just their two previous albums ) . later , like during declining years 1976 their quite bit more " filler " material . but if you're fan like me , you explore some great songs forgotten later years . my only recommendation this material gets remastered . sound overall fine ear adjusts close balance , but it needs just hint more air around sound like wonderfully sounding " homecoming " album - especially all this incredible production . overall , not bad all simple guitar-based band . not bad indeed ! (by way , final note , i burned car copies store bought cd . homecoming hat trick fit nice snuggily together one cd , well holiday hearts - - hideaway harbor . give it shot yourself !	1

this used my least favorite release due its lackluster production quality comparison releases like antichrist mechanical . but you've got consider time , 1994 . grunge dead something dark more innovative music starting form . portrait beginning this change . its great album , not taken too seriously . it shows mansons roots , his youthful rage , not yet completely clouded his own nihilism . its punky metal industrial fuzz all around edges . start finish its solid album , catchy , enjoyable enough hooks keep your average listener interested . compared lot other bands albums came out around time , portrait sets standard . quality songwriting , overall structure valid message delivered candy coated fist face . just beginning mansons legendary career , definitly worth purchasing .	1

mark hall songwriting incredible !!! all songs he writes come very personal need tell story or portray message ... these not generic songs sound like every other christian song . mix throaty , passionate , pitch-perfect voice , what more i say ? not only , but mark walks walk . he my son youth pastor , he not only cares each every student , but he also challenges them best they ... his best set example without pretending " super christian guy " never struggles setbacks . my favorite songs this album : set me free ( must listened very loudly ... instrumentals out this world . this story legion mark 5 : 1-20 . [ ... ] . ) prodigal ( story prodigal son son point view ... i dig spanish guitar)and now my lifesong sings ( simple melodic ; best vocal album)i bought this cd so many times , gifts , it so good . i may buy yet one because mine starting skip , but it worth it . you won't disappointed	1
what fantastic collection songs ! anybody who gives this cd bad review biggest ignoramous ever lived . sound might not perfect , ( home demos , who knows what kind shape tapes ? )however , great music performances shine through nevertheless . ( i recommend 7 park avenue over more recent far less consistent pete ham cd , quot ; golders greenquot ;) . i think pete ham lot all he going him , i mean , so much songwriting talent , girlfriend who loved him , why he would want take his life . i hear all stories , but , well least we this superb collection his songs cherish , compilation pete would undoudtedly proud released	1
despite eventually dropped their record label , imperial drag band possessed rare ability combine rough , raw energy , thoughtful , even humorous lyrics . their two hit singles , quot ; spyderquot ; quot ; boy or girl , quot ; only tip iceberg . however , gain greater appreciation their sound , you would probably best served check out band preceeded imperial drag ; band jellyfish , it fronted gifted musician andy sturmer , drags roger manning eric dover , current sheryl crow bassist tim smith . jellyfish , like imperial drag , little less than 15 minutes fame , which only goes show successful music business , quot ; catchy simplequot ; continually prevails over quot ; substance music . quot ; too bad . both bands innovative well worth money it costs buy one their cds	1

this imported 5 cd anthology which summarizes career british band free . first three discs contain remastered versions ( excellent sound ) , alternate takes , non-lp tracks unissued tracks their career . fourth disc contains alternate versions unissued tracks their live album . last disc summarizes solo career members band . booklet excellent many pictures , chart information other useful information band . free unjustly overshadowed bluesy vocalist paul rodgers ' drummer simon kirke later band bad company . i find this band much more interesting . while material less commercial than their later work bad company , this material delivered more feeling . late guitarist paul kossoff his impressive blues laden vibrato attack highly influential . ex-john mayall bass player andy fraser excellent musician , witness " mr. big " example . this song anthem " all right now " " wishing well " probably band most requested songs . some my favorites include " i'll creepin '" , " broad daylight " , " stealer " , " little bit love " among many others . free reportedly big influence lynyrd skynyrd . band pretty much burned out departures paul kossoff rodgers ' song writing partner andy fraser . one album released after they departed . band played such festivals isle wight during their halcyon days . it may useful compare this set domestic 2 cd anthology " molten gold " . while this set much more comprehensive " molten gold " contain some tracks which not " songs yesterday " box set . excellent songs such cover albert king " hunter " , great instrumental " mouthful grass " " catch train " among others included " molten gold " anthology but not " songs yesterday " anthology . some cuts " songs yesterday " box set appear only alternate versions while original versions appear 2 cd " molten gold " . however , this comparison aside i recommend " songs yesterday " box set long time fans band like myself or novices alike . price worth every penny rare tracks alternate takes well remastering booklet . if you limited budget least invest " molten gold " 2 disc set you converted	1
seeing " pulp fiction " quite revelation . i thought , " this kind movie i've waited my whole life . " although i only 16 when i saw it movies . so i couldn't wait follow-up pulp . i waited , waited , waited seemingly forever quentin tarantino next movie . finally december 1997 came " jackie brown " . i didn't see movie when it came out but i'd always look soundtrack music stores wondering if i should buy it . after all , soundtrack pulp incredible movie . really , music intregal movie , you can't separate two . so i never bought soundtrack jackie because i hadn't watched movie . then last summer i finally watched movie t.v. i quickly realized it quite good movie some really cool music well . now i'm ashamed say i waited so long watch movie thus buy soundtrack , movie dvd . there great hits here such " midnight confession " , " strawberry letter #23 " , " didn't i blow your mind this time " which essentially movies theme . but there wonderful lost classics such " street life " , minnie ripperton " inside my love " , johnny cash " tennessee stud " , bobby womack singing " across 110th st " , course pam grier herself singing " long time woman " . if you haven't seen movie i recommend you . it excellent . you should probably wait buy soundtrack until after you've seen movie too , otherwise songs won't same impact . either way though it long line quirky , funky , phenomenal tarantino sountracks	1

blaze glory not bon jovi album , but rather jon bon jovi session players doing soundtrack terrible emilio estevez film young guns ii . however , don't let deter you buying this album , because album associated such lame movie , music lyrics remarkably high quality . lyrics seem first standard old west fare , but if your intake omega-3 fatty acids b-vitamins ample , you tell without reading lyric sheet- other words , just listening very hard- there deeper meaning them . songs actually form cautionary suite warns against getting into dangerous situations any kind , inspiring me never go anywhere without telling someone where i'll , well influencing my predilection putting up photos pretty actresses my wall deterrent self-indulgent behavior . if i not believed this interpretation lyrics , i would not living my own right now . if you've just gotten your first apartment , or getting ready , you must buy this album . it jon bon jovi first truly serious work , presaging keep faith two years , making it pivotal moment his career	1
i till late only casual listener tff , fact considerably disappointed their later " seeds love " album . nevertheless , i took chance triple set what seemed least two very good albums ( hurting / big chair ) . listened all three now , i say " hurting " tff masterpiece . album more melodious than its successors ( bar perhaps slightly raucous " prisoner " ) , vocal delivery guitar/synth arrangements much more effective . " big chair " just two great tracks , but this one consistently good beginning end . if you own just one tff record , this should it . " mad world " " pale shelter " alone worth price	1

this spectacular album , unnecessary bonus tracks notwithstanding , almost singlehandedly rescued reputation this band , which tarnished horrifying " tales topographic oceans " tepid " relayer " . every track here like its own universe , there stunning moments each player well tremendous collective songcraft beautiful , uncluttered production . hell , i even like alan white playing this one , i usually can't stand him . i kind feel sorry him actually , because following bill bruford band gotta bit like following jesus jerusalem hilton . just ask pat mastelotto . this record quite ride , beginning crunchy steel guitar madness title track ( punctuated singer humorously self-effacing words deriding his overly " cosmic mind " ) . this song almost sounds like cross " heart sunrise " fragile flying burrito brothers ' " train song , " if you imagine such thing without your head spontaneously explode . next tune yes classic storytelling , sculptor whose muse dies , leaving him attempt resurrect her out stone his work . peaks this song just over moon , culminating transcendent guitar part comes out line how " when we're young , love lingers so " punctuated throughout ultra-gorgeous acoustic arabesques fingers howe floaty , enveloping soundstage production-wise . my personal favorite this disc maybe my all-time favorite yessong . next squire showcase , fat-bottomed " parallels , " which sounds not unlike " hold out your hand " his then-current solo record , excellent fish out water . great super-churchy organ caped crusader here , well some nice multitracking voices . this features trademark , diatonic , positive mood this band was/is famous . side two we begin brief , lush sing-along proceed into conclusion original lp one great yes epics , " awaken , " which just soars like earth 60,000 mph moment morning when sun breaks your particular horizon . call " awaken " celestial character would like calling black sabbath " loud " . anyhow like i said bonus cuts needless , but original album so good it doesn't matter . booklet , however , very well all kinds new photos ( including one original lp gatefold where naughty , half-hidden smoking apparatus visible ! ) .	1
libertines band would fitted perfectly golden days rock'n'roll , it only shame they yet really reform . their debut album , " up bracket , " this london band churns out catchy , gritty rock'n'roll britpop twis t.t he album starts strong note " vertigo , " catchy garage-rocker alternates pete doherty slightly slurred singing , combustive short basslicks . " rapture vertigo/and letting go/me myself i never sure/was it liquor/or it my soul ? " doherty asks . his irreverent edge takes away any softer sentiments . style carries over yowling " horror show " sizzling " boys band , " drapes itself over entire album like worn leather jacket . there handful lower-key guitar rockers , like simmering " begging " smooth " tell king , " well strummy slightly surreal " radio america . " libertines only made two albums , but their kinetic sound made them musical presence both sides pond . what more , it just fun listen -- their music rare quality genuinely catchy , energetic , rough well-written . it difficult enough find one those qualities , so finding one all above rarity . pete doherty , now out band , pretty good service frontman . his vocals strong if bit slurred ; he raise his voice scream , or lower it seductive little chant . but surprisingly , more you listen this , more it becomes obvious other libertines just important their sound . doherty carl barat exceptional double-duty guitarists , all punk riffs deliberately sloppy edges . it all wrapped around strong , lyrics drinking , groupies bad-boy rockers some good music . if doherty doesn't shoot himself up into grave , he undoubtedly regarded masterful rock writer . places , they sound like band disintegrate , but only adds punky-laddish flavour " up bracket .

super-sonic jazz not nearly avantgarde suns albums became starting early sixties , rather this album documents sun earlier more traditional work . those you who didn't know master big band free jazz could swing play blues you should check this stuff out . i love sun ra more demanding avantgarde material sixties , seventies eighties , but this album very cool . you tell sun fancy just begining take flight he starting add different rhythms instrumentation more exotic harmony his repetoire . arrangements compositions just starting get " out . " instance album opener india bit exotica played electric piano . many tunes use tympani odd melody lines such stunning el sound joy . other tunes sound like charles mingus period but odd harmonic sensibility . ra piano recalls thelonius monk his use space occasionally tiny bit sun cecil taylor-like style pokes through . but general he swings solos more traditional though harmonically advanced way . playing his side men top notch . featured john gilmore , pat patrick julian priester . super sonic jazz just really enjoyable listen beginnings one jazz most ou t-t here intriguing composers . its melodic , exotic swinging . bonus it well recorded	1
debut album like one smiths makes one wonder : what life like before it released ? whom could disaffected teens twenty-somethings turn before morrissey made things clear all who heard him ? interestingly , my life more or less smiths-less until i my late-20s . only exposure them came my high school best friend , who everything his power get me like band . alas , i hopelessly devoted classic progressive rock time , wasn't admit contemporary popular music didn't it origins 1970s could worthwhile or ( heaven forbid ) better . thankfully , i became convert time morrissey solo comeback , i feel i more than made up lost time . smiths never known rocking hard , but they always able put their own twist basic rock ' roll . throughout their career , this would often take form rockabilly . their debut , it demonstrated spot-on single " hand glove " , which marries old-fashioned harmonica johnny marr . . . -like , trance-inducing arpeggios . morrissey also presents himself right off bat someone who wouldn't pull any punches terms subject matter . this song , he sings homosexual love something sincere deep or delicate fleeting any other form love . band rocks hardest " miserable lie " , which drummer mike joyce speeds agile fashion . morrissey starts sound like rooster end , but he regains his composure nicely " pretty girls make graves " . latter two tracks began morrissey tradition revealing disposition singer song title itself . obviously most these not ready-made widespread appeal . however , morrissey marr knew just well how craft single hit potential , indicated not only " hand glove " , but also " this charming man " - which propelled excellent groovy bass work andy rourke trademark jangle marr - " what difference it make ? " . perhaps best way illustrate difference singles rest album songs consider contrast first song listeners heard radio ( " hand glove " ) first one they heard record , " reel around fountain " . latter trades all radio-ready punch more intimate feel . difference their singles non-singles noted , " still ill " -also featuring harmonica - may proven hit-worthy its own right . great smiths ' best albums , they each one dud them . queen dead , it " never no one ever " , strangeways , here we come it " death disco dancer " . debut album , it " i don't owe you anything " , which borderline musak . but like songs other records , it not enough make it lesser album , but simply slow its momentum bit . " suffer little children " doesn't pick up pace or lift one spirits , but it closes album affecting listener way smiths song meant . smiths ' 1984 debut one best most important debuts 1980s , history indie/alternative rock . amazingly , although released only 4 albums new material their time together , it one 3 those albums worthy 5 stars . it also start career , terms ratio length quality , only compared beatles . his own review smiths ' singles , amazon friend mine referred smiths completists " vanishing tribe " . my opinion , completist only kind smiths fan .	1
before i'd discovered rjd2 i hadn't even heard instrumental hiphop . but i'd notions it . i listened hiphop , but i always more intrigued beat . i'd ask myself why nobody ever thought dropping mc letting kick , snare , synth take over show . then one day i downloaded whole bunch rjd2 tracks , they pretty much changed my life . i went out bought deadringer saw rj new york columbus ( his hometown ! ) convinced hiphop didn't get much better than this . i'm kind biased towards rjd2 when it comes other turntablists producers - he first guy i heard it well , becuase he kind represents , me , what genre should sound like . more i listen this record , more i appreciate it . rj interpretation hiphop deadringer , me , perfect . he expertly measured out portions soul , jazz , rock mixed it all together . those genres emanate samples he uses , drum rhythms , individual instruments , melodies he constructs . top all three guest mc appearances - serving prove where he came assure any doubters this not trip-hop , this hiphop . i listened big portion dj shadow discography aftwerwards because everybody said he rj influence . it pretty easy spot shadow traces rj work . but there big difference two artists : dj shadow work ( i'm talking " endtroducing " " preemptive strike " ) strays far hiphop , enough leave some people confused what genre it really fits into . that not bad thing ; it pretty amazing . shadow strips down his sound much more experimental way than rj deadringer . it seemed me like rjd2 trying prove through deadringer you eliminate mc , programmed sequenced loops , still call it hiphop . needless say , he it ease	1
this album , first issued 1988 , out print since i became johnny cash fan 1993 . it finally reissued this spring . it great . catchy tunes , guest parts singers such paul mccartney , everly brothers , waylon jennings hank williams jr. but highlight , me , couple really moving songs family love . one grieving song adult children their late mother . it so unusual popular music address parent-child love . there probably one parent-child love song every 1,000 songs infatuation -- almost never ode child parent . this beautiful one . johnny cash enjoyed something resurgence few years ago when people their teens 20s started listening his stuff . but my mind , this album better than anything he more recently	1

playing time - 33:06 -- it seems appropriate john starling , originally alabama , begins his first new album more than decade southerner hit , " waiting train , " jimmie rodgers . while starling doesn't include characteristic singing brakeman yodel , he impart his own remarkably distinctive voice plenty relaxed country hits lilting melodies thought-provoking lyrics . heart full emotion , starling milks lyrics their lament , love hope . john lead vocals rhythm guitar grace all tracks , mike auldridge resophonic guitar tom gray bass . friends years , all three seldom scene connection . john left seminal group 1988 concentrate full-time his medical practice , before rejoining band its guitarist lead singer second time 1992-94 . starling debut solo release ( waitin ' southern train ) showed his eclectic tastes bluegrass , honky tonk , classic country . he also put out highly-acclaimed albums 1987 ( spring training ) 1990 ( long time gone ) . now retired , john invited some his best musical friends collaborate " slidin ' home . " you may recall starling directed award-winning " trio " album linda ronstadt , emmylou harris dolly parton . minor role , emmylou sings john song she co-wrote gram parsons , " my hour darkness . " i'm sure john sees some himself personally relate lines like " but he just country boy , his simple tunes confess . music he him , so very few possess . " other choices he made this album tap reservoirs some crafty profound writers . i've heard missy raines jim hurst sing beautiful " cold hard business " ( their " synergy " album ) , but starling rendition jon randall . oft-covered song passion , leon payne " they'll never take her love me " takes great deal courage present . my goodness , starling still manages impart his seductive charm song sung likes hank williams , george jones , marty robbins , emmylou harris , waylon jennings . i never tire good hard-hitting familiar favorite , it ten years since waylon it . ten cuts spanning 33 minutes , album just tad short . interspersed mellow offerings couple tuneful instrumentals , " south riding tango " " irish spring . " both feature hot licks two guests album -- jimmy gaudreau ( mandolin ) rickie simpkins ( fiddle ) . added embellishment some selection , other guest musicians include jon randall , kent ippolito , jay starling , pete wasner , larry stephenson . auldridge also lays some tracks weissenborn guitar or lap steel . example , former instrument used impart bluesy twang " those two blue eyes , " song we may best remember driving bluegrass number keith whitley released rebel label 1972 . lap steel piano perfectly voice their genial moods lowell george " willin ' , " favorite song john ( recorded linda rondstadt ) . sleepy score truck driver heading home declares strong sentiment - " my head stove , but i'm still my feet , i'm still willin ' . " john starling closes " slidin ' home " one his most tender sentiments epitomizes entire project . sweet endearing tune , " prayer my friends , " comes award-winning tennessee songwriters jeff barbra sarah pirkle . john acknowledges wonderful people whom he depends . " our pathways different but i love them no less ... i'm so grateful people i my life , they help me what right ... my heart here tonight , they're dear my heart all time ... " john new album laid-back textures , he sings life tender , kind empathetic way . ( joe ross , staff writer , bluegrass now , roseburg , or . )	1
masterminded tchort ( silent `t ' i presume ) , former emperor bassist , this astounding concept album one 60-minute track . it not album , it cohesive , one-hour song . i ripped song ten parts even so , it almost impossible only listen one part without wanting hear next , next , so so forth . light day , day darkness impressive beyond comprehension . song never becomes technically demanding or too progressive , nor it ever fall into trap becoming clich� doom rock ( which plagues many clones genre ) repetitive unoriginal riffs . instead , album excels every change melody . kjetil nordhus voice , though not amazing , perfectly morose bleak album dark sinister mood . employing extra musicians add numerous musical elements ( strings , organs , saxophones , choir , death-metal grunt ) , tchort creates album whose changes keep music alive going - not once this song ( except maybe around 30-minute mark where woman starts vocalize ) energy die . none instruments ever used too much , nor any one section ever monopolize attention . additionally , none sections ever too intense or out-of-place . times , album may lack little subtlety , but not so any one moment sounds out place . influences range doom-metal power-metal even nordic folk jazz . my personal favorite " section " " song " last around 10-minute mark 16-minute mark . here , tchort exhibits acoustic guitars , astounding symphonic accompaniments closing riff could scare corpse-paint off any black-metal enthusiast . here how i would divide album ( trust me , this best division there ): part .... start ... finish ... length ... rating ( 0 = bad , 3 = great)i ....... 00:02 ... 06:47 .... 6:43 ..... 3ii ...... 06:47 ... 11:21 .... 4:34 ..... 3iii ..... 11:21 ... 18:01 .... 6:40 ..... 4iv ...... 18:01 ... 21:54 .... 3:53 ..... 2v ....... 21:54 ... 32:45 ... 10:51 ..... 3vi ...... 32:45 ... 37:27 .... 4:42 ..... 1vii ..... 37:27 ... 44:24 .... 6:57 ..... 3viii .... 44:24 ... 52:42 .... 8:18 ..... 2ix ...... 52:42 ... 55:20 .... 2:38 ..... 3x ....... 55:20 ... 60:08 .... 4:48 ..... 2a dark progressive gem unlikely genre , light day , day darkness majestic sets tchort apart true musician . see also : green carnation - blessing disguise , agalloch - mantle	1
it impossible overstate influence buddy holly rock ' roll . it said buddy holly beginning 1960 musically . he massive influence british invasion . it not buddy holly , it doubtful beatles would've happened . what buddy holly crickets laid down tape producer norman petty his clovis , nm studio nothing short revolutionary . this cd goes straight up hillbilly rockabilly holly hop his early decca sessions bradly barn , all way absolutely stunning orchestral pop true love ways raining my heart his very last session month before plane crash took lives holly , ritchie valens big bopper . keep mind this nearly all within space 2 1/2 years . many singers songwriters don't cover amount stylistic ground buddy crickets covered 20 years , much less 2 1/2 . buddy put his soul into all it . many artists music don't anywhere near joyfulness heart buddy music . this music still influencing musicians gaining younger fans because it . there simply nothing else like buddy . there 50 tracks here , all essential buddy . this music not dated all , still sounds fresh it nearly 50 years ago . my ears , it sounds fresher than some things released 5 months ago . my only complaint version peggy sue got married included here fireballs version , it completely inappropriate surf guitar lead nearly drowns out buddy vocals . there version this done(overdubbed jack hansen combo , i believe ) my mind far superior sounds closer how buddy probably intended it . reviewer said these cd not use all their 80 minute running time . i think few tracks i think should've included , like that what they say famous demos he made shortly before his death his apartment greenwich village . but all all , if you're new buddy , get this . you'll thankful you . but it hard listen this not think what else he could've achieved if he hadn't died such young age .	1
this 1974 follow-up masterpiece future days ( 1973 ) , witnessed marked change personnel slight change overall sound . after very subdued performance future days , japanese vocalist damo suzuki left band leaving members holger czukay ( bass ); michael karoli ( guitar , vocals dizzy dizzy chain reaction ); jaki leibezeit ( drums ); irmin schmidt ( piano , synthesizers , vocals come sta , la luna ) carry . although i like damo vocal style much better , michael irmin ok job their alternately buried-in-the-mix electronically altered vocal parts . five tracks album range length 5'44 " 11'12 " most display typical sound , although there more emphasis bouncy rhythms , brighter textures first three tracks . specifically , there bossa nova there come think , splash almost east coast ( hot ) jazz feel it - only loosest sense style however . jaki excellent drummer he fantastic job both styles - fact his propulsive style really drives this entire album . my favorite tracks include pulsating chain reaction ( 11'12 " ) synthesizer heavy atmospheric quantum physics ( 8'33 " ) . it worth noting chain reaction quantum physics seamlessly joined , creating larger track approaches 20 minutes length . my guess this attempt recreate epic nature 20 minute piece bel air ( future days album ) . my opinion it worked very well - it favorite after all . this good album marks transitional period career recommended tago mago ( 1971 ) , ege bamyasi ( 1972 ) , excellent future days ( 1973 )	1
this classic deep purple lineup , legendary mk2 7th final studio album . now maybe it not quite achievement 1984 reunion , let alone glory days 1970-1973 , but it still deep purple . story behind this 1993 album simple , it initially recorded 1992 replacement singer joe lynn turner ( replacing gillan 1989 ) , who fronted rainbow like " slaves masters " album . then , turner got fired half way through making this album , when old record company said ' we want gillan back or no new album . blackmore unwillingly accept record companies wish - rest band well , so they rang up mr. gillan . truth , lord , glover paice wanted turner out gillan , even before record company called . backing tracks already , gillan difficult job creating vocal melodies ideas would work pre-recorded music . actually , help bassist roger glover , they great job . i'm 100% sure this much better than what joe lynn turner written sung . gillan probably most underrated lyricist hard rock/heavy metal field . whereas turner lyrics tend more foreigner ; gillan more dylan . course blackmore wasn't happy bringing gillan back left after european leg tour . thus , " battle rages " final album classic lineup . any legendary band ac zz , would give their soul album this strong , so pick it up if you're fan classic deep purple lineup . highlights : nasty piece work , solitaire , anya title track	1
i hate say this but after listening this cd several times , i've found it more more boring each listen . reba adds nothing new here ... nothing she hasn't covered past . none songs here , possible exception " moving oleta " garner " classic " status my opinion . no song year candidates this bunch . reba way better past . even bluegrass country tunes lack substance because reba just not able pass them off convincingly . it almost sounds if she forced them . i'm talking " i'm gonna climb mountain " " sky full angels " . ballads o.k. ( room breathe , if i any sense left all , once you've learned lonely " ) but reba offers nothing new here them you haven't heard before . most stuff just like stuff she always puts out .... mixture country/pop tunes severence emphasis crossover . we've seen heard it before	-1

this album not i expected it ... i read all great reviews sort anticipated better quality album ... or rather , something more intricate , more creative . it just sounds so repetitive . i am huge fan instrumental rock , godspeed ! you black emperor great orchestral rock group example , mum , sigur ros , album leaf all great examples . tristeza not me , i just dont believe instruments used music perfect instrumental rock ... because theres no variety , you expect same thing over over again . its slow pretty boring . doesn't fit my taste	1
mike kensilla amazing . all his projects different , yet golden their own right . i would compare it further seems forever dashboard , both good but different sound . owen soft indie beautiful lyrics remind me weakerthan lyrics . check out nobodys nothing , ghost what should . two really great songs my opinion . so if you liked kensilla other projects ie american football or owls ; or death cab then this should great cd you	1

ricky skaggs ' first christmas album multiple family affair . addition vocals picking his children molly luke , album also features whites ( buck , sharon , cheryl , rachel ) members skaggs ' band , kentucky thunder . material leans heavily american christmas season standards , both high-spirited ( " let it snow " ) faithful ( " what child this ? " ) , focus multipart harmonies ( rather than bluegrass picking ) add warmth any holiday celebration . playing swings lightly " let it snow " " hangin ' round mistletoe , " picking sprightly instrumental rendition " deck halls .

this nice recording you get some fine vocals elvis but what heck happened scotty guitar work ? he great " elvis presley " recording , which basically rockabilly record , but scotty badly slighted this one . it like they locked his guitar closet or something ! it interesting recording you track transformation or evolution elvis ' music rockabilly rock-n-roll . problem , rockabilly 100 percent better music ! it involved much more musicianship , way more fun listen too got your toes tappin ' way more than this type rock . think some greats who rockabilly stand outs . carl perkins , early elvis , gene vincent host other wonderful talents . it shame rockabilly ever faded into near oblivion it shame this recording could not featured scotty bit more .	1
no cool hawaiin language ( no lyrics all ) , every track same , too much ocean background ( used every track i think ? )	1
one best live cd i ever hear	1
all but one celebrities this album should ashamed themselves ... not only they not sing , but laws ought passed so something like this never perpetrated upon listening public again ... sebastian cabot perhaps worst offender(and least remembered)of celebrities who appear this album ... time cabot , small , rotund englishman , playing jeeves-like butler american sitcom actor brian keith(who not sing any album i am aware of)and two snotty kids .. cabot renditions two early bob dylan tunes enough cause glass shatter(in protest , not because cabot voice strength , say , ella fitzgerald ) ... jack webb first wife , julie london could sing(and very well , too ) .. maybe her vocal success made great stoneface jealous ... or maybe he just got tired known his " jus t-t he-facts-mam " monotone " dragnet " .. any event , his rendering " try little tenderness " proves old saw every intelligent person knows resprects his/her limitations .. joel grey sing , well , sort ... he star original " cabaret " , both broadway movie version ... but sounding like gremlin hollywoodesque nazi-accent his role " cabaret " not same doing " white room " ... i mean , " cabaret " we all knew grey charecter , his vocals , weren't taken seriously .... mae west one foot grave other bannana peel when she inflicted her version " twist shout " listening public .. she also recently completed filming her worst film appearance ever " myra breckinridge " ) .. taken together west final choices much sink star-status impression which hers 1920s 1930s ... andy griffith , mayberry amiable policeman , navigate his way through old time hymns , evidenced his numerous gospel efforts , but singing pop quite beyond his ability .. singing " house rising sun " something akin scooby doo attempting " ave maria " ... shatner nimoy " star trek " fame also appear this disc , but any discussion thier utter lack vocal ability would require page after page(and numerous expletive deleted references)and perhaps better attempted elsewhere ... finally we eddie albert , ww2 war hero , actor , writer , star " green acres " , yes , decent vocalist , who one time sing 1940s big bands ... alas , eddie talents better suited such ballads " jenny kissed me " (one his 1950s hit singles)than doing " blowing wind " .. goof , this album sort funny first time it heard , but like topical joke it becomes very stale thereafte	1
different angle viewing this cd : i'm rock climber , lot indoor climbing through winter . usually i go much more upbeat songs , but guy i met climbing recommended this cd change . wow . something feeling music just feels good . he described it ' chill ' . i can't think better word	1
alone my hotel room working saturday morning mtv-asia background , i first heard " fly away " . hearing demos her website ( it great way - www.corinnemay.com ) several cds later , i am fan , actually more admirer her craf t.t here some artists whose material based what masses want , genres du-jour . i admit those my library . it just i can't too much it - they indulgences . then there artists like corinne may who uses music medium communicate you . what you end up hearing not just notes or arrangement , but message they trying tell you , confiding their most inner listener . she tells you her relationships , both horizontal vertical . you may not know anything her parents or her providence but that beauty music such this . it pulls you process , you experience . i one am deeply appreciative there " corinne mays " out there who stays true their craft uses music means end instead letting music end itself . i recommend you hear it experience it yourself .	1
great collection dance numbers mostly 1930 - 32 . excellent sound quality very good liner notes . musicianship solid , there plenty very tastey licks adrian rollini bass sax . all but one tunes singing , many trio vocals . several tunes jazz standard catalog , but many forgotten little ditties brimming pep optimism . i've played this one alot	1
i rarely review albums unless i read something so stupid it bears responding . this mpd 360 cat or whatever hell his/her/its name flaming retard . why ? let me break it down really quick : . ) he cites linkin parks ' monotony ... then suggests underoath alternative ... underoath one most monotonous emo-rock bands ever ... every single member band looks like clone one guy who cuts himself , wears sweaters doesn't like able see through his dirty blonde hair . . ) he complains songs don't sound like originals ... what retard buys remix album hear original versions ? . ) he somehow manages miss fact linkin park heavily influenced hip hop ... complains there mcs this project ... maybe he never heard rapping original version , noticed band dj , or heard them doing collaborations jay-z collision course ep , dan automator handsome boy modeling school albums ... maybe he just doesn't know . somebody ought tell him , then . . ) he says linkin park uses simplistic chord structures melodies layers ... whether they're top 40 or not , linkin park one most multilayered densely mixed sounds i've ever heard my life ... i get paid review albums . verdict ? this guy retard . i think i'm bit biased , i assumed much soon i heard him pimping underoath ... how someone insults band lacking creativity then lists underoath favorite , i no idea . but that beside point . screw this kid , he no idea what he talking ... probably because his sweater too tight blood loss last time he cut himself starting make him dizzy . record itself , it very well . i think mixing collision course little bit better , but one or two people , this entire rogue gallery hip hop quotables well known alternative musicians singers . personally , i could without jonathan davis one my favorite linkin park songs , though . i say , while i love how far remixes deviate originals , you lose lot feeling put into originals emotion gets muddled mixing cutting pasting ... but it good album far remixes go . if you like this ... check out jay-z/linkin park collision course album , or handsome boy modeling school album " white people " there song there features both mike chester , well dj shadow someone else , i forget who other mc moment . but check out if you love good collaborations . anyone else who thought process similar this mpd 360 cat or whatever eff his name ... some things best left kept yourself	1
why they wait so long put this out ? great find well worth price . fact , it steal	1
album flawless . musicianship so tight economical not single note or beat seems out place(every person i've ever known thrilled hear " pump it up " ) . while one obviously would not cast ec " i pagliacci " , his vocal tones inflections perfect his material , perhaps never more so than this record . but what makes listening this so breathtaking writing . this , armed forces , represents most brilliant songwriting performance history popular music . genre once relied " one-two-three'o'clock , four'o'clock rock " " tutti-fruitti aw rooty " now declan great provide " you want throw me away , but i'm not broken " " i want bite hand feeds me " . forget trying pigeonhole this saying it part this new wave trend or punk scene - this one greatest all rock'n'roll records period should owned everyone .	1
i bought galactic first cd quot ; coolin offquot ; shocked what i heard , musicians galactic know their instuments love playing them . quot ; crazyhorse mongoosequot ; i satisfied , quot ; late futurequot ; . but galactic hadn't reinvented themselves , quot ; ruckusquot ; they , their sound changed little they've drifted away funk , losing solos , adding more vocals . but this album great , some great tracks include : moil , never called you crazy , kid keener , beast , doomed , my favorite , tenderness . buy this album if you want get groove , but buy coolin off first , if you're newcomer galactic	1

jewel crowding up dancefloor her new single standgt ; original classic remixes awesome . they follow more or less path her last two singels but different unique way . although they remixes , it still stays very true original which not case singel intuition . these remixes sound like song which why i love it so much , full lyrics great dance beats , each one different , no repetitions here . also she stays away past remixers goes remixers like mike rizzo , which great . so if you wanna get pumped go out any night , buy this cd pump it up	1
after wham ! broke up it almost inevitable george michael would become solo star , he already solo hit " careless whisper " " diffrent corner " his duet aretha franklin " i know you waiting " also hit . " faith " released 1987 it also sold around 10 millions copies , it without doubt george most comercially succesful album . " faith " shows maturity but it also continues catchy uptempo songs wham ! famous , it great mix effective soul-pop like title track slow personal ballads like " father figure " . it also great streak 5 #1 hits billboard charts . george also became first white male artist reach #1 rb charts . first single " faith " catchy uptempo almost became trademark him . it starts face-up organ most song but eventually one-chord guitar introduced too . it hell song . " father figure " far more moody song , infact it soulish ballad feautures gospel choirs somewhat mysterious sound . both faith father figure #1 hits . " i want you sex lll " indeed 2 diffrent version song , it 9 minutes long . first one soul-pop but second more retro-soul horns , something phil collins would proud . song considered very controvercial upon it release , both title lyrics offensive many people song banned certain stations would only played late night mtv . song #1 hit us nonetheless . " one more try " touching ballad man not willing get into new relationshiop cause he hurt so many times before . it his 4th #1 hit " faith " . " hard day " never released single but would become hit too i think . it uptempo song reminds me " i want your sex " . " hand mouth " also non-single , it great touching slow paced song american dream . it tells story 2 diffrent people both want experience american dream , but none succeeds one shoots people other one ends up becoming prostitute . critizism reagan america , simular recent single " shoot dog " towards bush . " look your hands " jazzy song also brings up social issues , this time domestic violence . " monkey " catchy uptempo aswell , it his 5th #1 hit it not hard understand why . ballad " kissing fool " only reached #5and last single this album . it sound alot like upcoming material he going release later . upcoming song remix " hard day " last one third version " i want your sex " this one very slow paced though . overall , great solo debut george not only sold incredibly well but also flawless song 1 song 11 . all songs worthwile , he makes good mix catchy uptempo touching ballads . 80 classic without doubt	1

i am opinion proper country record cannot made these days unless jim lauderdale sings harmonies . folks like lucinda williams , buddy miller , fabulous chris gaffney dwight yoakum agree me . everyone raves jim lauderdale songwriting ability ( it awesome its power ! ) , but i never read much what great singer he . listen this record see what i mean . start merle world , honky tonk haze , first things first go there . only reason i gave it 4 stars instead 5 because i think del reeves/lauderdale version diesel , diesel , diesel rig rock deluxe record better . this hard country record enough steel guitar ( which means bunch ) . lauderdale voice blends so perfectly steel you'll honky tonk heaven	1

when british press go britpop , ever expected re-invasion american shores wave british bands ' par excellence ' , names oasis , blur pulp always pushed forward great white hopes their generation . personally , only band i ever bought albums wave groups , supergrass . me they only band writing truly creative , innovative pop , while harnessing all tools trade other british invasions proved successful . oasis song , i always heard song it previously band or two . blur , i could always pull out david bowie or xtc album song[s ] reminiscent , or blatantly inspired . pulp , i just truly found them bit boring , nothing kinks hadn't 10x better back 60 . but supergrass , even if i could name influence ( kinks certainly there ) , i absolutely thought song[s ] incredibly catchy , totally supergrassed , most bands would love least 3 songs quality album , let alone issue album after album strong material track track . supergrass , me , britain great white hope . their style influence comes bowie , bolan , pink floyd davies ' pop world , but its absolute quality songs one after other says supergrass takes , but gives back . its very rare group 2nd album outshines their debut , but this album this . their 3rd 4th albums push envelope even further , but its wiser start off their debut album , or this one , get what it means get supergrassed . it sheer pop , i never minded ' slightly kooky ' nature supergrass material or its members , because underneath all band who immensely creative their studio time , plants hooks galore its songs ( there always something placed supergrass song instantly latchable ) , mixes their albums diverse , always interesting material . 60 , 70 , 80 all covered , sometimes within one song , but it always sounds like supergrass . one could say any britpop bands , especially liam gallagher '' vocal '' stylings oasis ( not particularly fan ) , but supergrass it sounds unique . it sounds different , not so reliant hype , but more music , creativity writers . '' richard iii '' anthem . maybe 20 years time , it'll recognised anthem , or least nostalgically remembered anthem could've , but beginning end , song screams ' make me standard ' , ' play me incessantly until people get sick me ' , ' make me institution ' . its theremin guided bridge section , its hard driving opening , '' richard iii '' sets supergrass standard above its more celebrated peers . unfortunately supergrass peers , there lot more material this album matches standard . basically , supergrass only competition itself . that what creative 50% . other 50% enjoying it .	1

this album simply outstanding , one elo 3 very best ( " new world record " " out blue " ) . i don't normally fall love albums upon first listen , needing little time get into used them - but " secret messages " blew me away each highly diverse multi-layered multi-faceted cut very first time heard back 1983 . its predescessor album " time " clever heck but somewhat self-conscious concept album my ears , so " secret messages " felt like incredible return classic elo form . first four songs particular mindblowing - what way start new world record!here track list original unreleased double album : side a1 . secret messages2 . loser gone wild3 . bluebird4 . take me onside b5 . stranger6 . no way out7 . beatles forever8 . letter spain9 . danger aheadside c10 . four little diamonds11 . train gold12 . endless lies13 . buildings eyes14 . rock ' ' roll kingside d15 . mandalay16 . time after time17 . after all18 . hello my old friendall these songs remastered version except " buildings eyes " , " mandalay " , " hello my old friend " ( these three " afterglow " ) , almost impossible-to-find tribute " beatles forever " ( whose lyrics found http://hjem.get2net.dk/10538overture/tekster/elo/beatles%20forever.htm ) . so you patch together something close original unreleased album using itunes , which well worth trouble . here some thought-provoking excerpted " secret " comments paul . johnson only appear amazon review unremastered cd : " jeff lynne solely became elo this point he also found sweet spot producer singer . ... willburys sound born this album . i am still not sure how he got overly processed-yet-dry sound jeff lynne trademark , but it really seems begun ' secret messages .

i refer first three meters albums --" meters " , " look-ka py py " , " struttin' " -- classic meters . this not classic meters , but it not big down step " cabbage alley " . classic meters ' songs based short , pentatonic/blues-scale riffs , they instrumental , predominated distorted hammond fat p-bass . this album predominated guitar , there not one instrumental tune . whole album clear studio-sound , not much " dirt " , but nevertheless groove something new uplifting : horns ! those who look something like " cissy strut " , " sophisticated cissy " , or " chicken strut " might disappointed , though . backing vocals non-highlight tunes " love me " " loving you " don't fit into meters ' sound ( it discussable ) , but horns " people say " " just kissed my baby " perfectly suiting joy-bringing spice . far perfect 12-minute " it ain't no use " bit time-filler ; guitar dominated ( times three overdubbed guitars ) mainstream rock-tune never really lifts , gets less less interesting , just isn't same calibre rest album , which it fills over fifth . bonus tracks aren't satisfaction me either ; they're edited versions " hey-pocky a-way " ( 35 seconds cut ) " people say " ( over 2 minutes cut ) . edits ruin original -- perfect -- arrangements songs furthermore groove like crazy throughout . if meters new you , you're looking album get you started right foot - go classic meters ; it help you appreciate this one later . if you're looking more grooves after listened classic meters , there lots music here won't disappoint ; least every other track album should give you complete satisfaction	1

unfortunately eagles leader glenn frey solo career consistently underrated compared don henley henley continued write ' searing social commentary ' songs made eagles so successful , while frey deliberately ' lightened up ' played mainly soul amp ; ramp ; influenced music . ' strange weather ' this all changes . there songs everything here ronald reagan , environment , la riots just good time ' before ship goes down ' . mood much darker than frey normally lighthearted work . even straight love songs such ' river dreams ' ' walk dark ' you get sense he brooding his own mortality , this also true magnificent , eagles-like ' part me , part you ' . however he throw more humorous songs like ' delicious ' ' big life ' . difference frey henley frey not take himself nearly seriously , he also far superior arranger writer melodies than henley . other major attraction his exhilaratingly pure tenor voice which still sounds good it 1972 . he probably sings more depth emotion this album than he ever . all eagles fans should listen this decide whether overproduced ranting henley albums really good its reputation suggests	1
i've fortunate kept up " overweight lover " all these years but undoubtedly this cd stands out not only his best , but classic five mic album . this when rap fun it wasn't all nonsense beefs ( see game/50 cent , nas/jay-z , lil kim/foxy brown ) , this time where if you couldn't rap , or you couldn't freestyle step up plate when called out , you're career . not like today where mushmouth rappers ( 50 cent g-unit , fabulous , ma$e , all rest those mushmouth , winey rappers we today)can live large off one cd . back then when it came lyrics , heavy right there talent big daddy kane , krs-one , chuck d , kool . rap , . o . . ' , ice cube , biz markie , ll cool j , kool moe dee , run dmc worlds where skills actually made or broke your career , not crossover radio play . where back then , it frowned upon other rap artists fans alike artist strictly make records cross over . however heavy , not only he lyrically gifted , bangin tracks radio just couldn't ignore party , but one first rappers incorporate reggae lyrics ( him jamaican descent ) into his songs ( check out " mood love " ) . while run dmc shattered charts " my adidas " , heavy shattering streets " nike " just when original air force one coming into their own . there not bad cut this lp all gyrlz they love me , probably banginest track here . just add one more piece heavster legacy , i never think one rap artist ever foul thing or bad thing or diss say heavy . which extremely rare today so-called rap climate . goes show not only respect this man garnered his peers , but he also gave same respect back . this what hip-hop supposed , original , skillful raps , staying true you without sellout .	1

this grotesquely underrated album . drum'n'bass purists trashed it its release date , unfair grounds photek sold out , gone house , gone commercial , etc . don't believe it ! not paying attention opinions others instead focusing music he truly wants create , photek created extremely diverse ( god forbid ) upbeat album . drum'n'bass headz everywhere dig infinity ( one best cuts cd , admittedly ) , while those who prefer chicago-style vocal house mine give can't come down , featuring charismatic vocals robert owens . some experimentation trip-hop evident well ( imagine massive attack without vocals ) . true , not atmospheric dark modus operandi , but definitely more soul	1

first off , let me say really appreciate music this cd , you see movie first . but if you're fan classical music , you'll love this . music really sends chill up your spine , take it me , who listens mostly punk/ska music . i adore this cd , quot ; suo ganquot ; haunting first time you hear it it stays you . rest songs great well , i especially enjoy all tracks except darker ones ( 4 , 6 , i think some ending ones , but not 13 , 13 rules ) . darker ones dont anything me , theyre too long i tend zone out . so all all , i recommend this cd 100% . movie great also . its one those films/cds you watch cloudy , wintery day w/ hot cocoa , cry your eyes out , its so emotional . lols , this stuff grea	1
i typically don't listen cw ; i'm more fan groups ' disturbed ' , ' staind ' , ' metallica ' , etc ., but i say this some best country western i've heard date . after listening title track ' when it all goes south ' , i went out bought cd . it laid back , upbeat , thoroughly enjoyable listen	1
run dmc hold special place my heart since they introduced convinced me rap deserves considered aspect music no different than rock , folk , etc . there materials worked , time , because " cross over " nature their songs . they injected true rock sensibility into their raps . i wish more artists today would utilize guitars real drums when rapping . when you listen this , main theme music fun . this roll down windows , crank it up , sing , songs . best songs ones incorporate rock structure pop culture . " its tricky " , " you rock it like " , " my adidas " , " mary , mary " " you illin " grea t.t he highlight " walk this way " . they took song essentially predecessor rap made it even more funky . i challlenge any aerosmith fan debate ... if it not run dmc then aerosmith would still obscure , over hill group 70 . they made aeromsith cool again ! run dmc version improvement over aerosmith . this song ultimate party tune . this cd belongs any essential rock cd collection	1
thanks reading . i love glenn frey . he great singer , he seems so much fun . i heard " one you love " years without knowing glenn frey it . what brilliant song . beautiful , sweet saxaphone , it almost out place not belonging this album . i bought this album strength one song , i wasn't disappointed . fans expecting more same won't get it though , this quite upbeat album . some gems include " i found somebody " also released single i think , " i volunteer " " all those lies " " don't give up " this great early 80s music , might bring back few memories some , although i only bought this few months ago myself ! i loved it- great cdeagles fans love it	1

this my new favorite christmas album . i wish i this years ago	1
why can't i find album which best belinda carlisle solo material together her greatest hits while still go-gos ? people like me love her both incarnations we don't want seek out two different greatest hits compilations completely different material each one . surely some budget label could combine all above . maybe they england , where ( or so my friend told me recently ) belinda . still considered major force pop , selling thousands records year . talk alternate universe ! meantime , until my next trip british record store , i playing this collection -- lot . when ever i'm down or depressed , all i listen " heaven " i get high right away . besides feel good song , it unveils any number intriguing theological speculations : " they say heaven love comes first , we'll make heaven place earth . " belinda begs question how conjoin two different worlds , but i think upfront romanticism track what made it favorite gay men all over world . we all looking world without borders where " love comes first . " ain't happening here this planet , not anytime soon . indeed walls keep climbing higher higher . " world alive sound kids street outside . " i'm not kid any more , neither belinda i'm sure , but we still cherish our dreams youth when anything seemed possible . whole lp filled brilliant touches ecstatic lyricism 1960s combined persuasive synthy percussions 80s . today these sound bit out place , but lp power move you back time . her best tracks evboke poetry california beach life , its transience ecstasy , like " circle sand " or spector-influenced " summer rain , " its claustrophobic , hypnotic mantra , " every time i see lightning/ every time i hear thunder/ every time i close window/ when this happens summer , night so inviting/ i feel you so close i feel you when wind blows right through my heart . " we've all epiphany , whenever summer comes it always time good dose belinda carlisle .	1
pure blues .. not confused stevie ray ... jimmi his own style playing blues ... great album ... well worth price !!	1
it ain't easy interpreter . christopher o'riley accomplished classical pianist , but his biggest claims fame three piano interpretations modern musicians -- two discs worth or re-imagined radiohead , now this excellent exploration elliott smith . most respectable classical musicians don't this sort thing -- they usually stick what deemed respectable composers . ones who bother anything composed after , say , 1925 played anything other than orchestra instruments ? they become little trashy association , exuding faint odor music whoredom they ride rock ' roll gravy train new release section bargain bin . ( this happens whether they're re-interpreting rolling stones or pink floyd or , heaven help us , metallica . ) heck , most musicians general fearful doing too much someone else work , lest they seen bar-band ready tribute acts rather than sainted singer-songwriters they'd like . thank heavens o'riley not like most musicians . he seems see interpretation something like what it used frank sinatra heydey -- something anyone should much they want , provided they're patient enough really take their time it bold enough make someone else songs their own . that true test musician -- not whether or not they cover other people work , but whether they put effort give their audience something more than tracing-paper copy song original outlines . standard , o'riley latest outing smashing success . it demanding listen--don't just pop while riding subway work . i'm thinking headphones home , late night , no distractions , just you chris chris piano elliott ghost . his previous outings , o'riley easier task -- most radiohead songs , lyrics musical tone match pretty well . ( paranoid songs sound paranoid . unhappy songs sound unhappy . ... well , just covers it , actually . not i'm complaining , thom . ) but what made elliott special , among other things , way he so frequently married bleak lyrics depression addiction self-loathing poppy little tunes radio-friendly anything this side early 60s beatles . so o'riley opted here re-imaginings somehow capture trajectory original songs while giving them melancholy feel elliot tragic lyrics aching voice . ( check out " i didn't understand " or " speed trials " or especially sad scared rumble " independence day " if you want know what i'm talking . ) usual , o'riley goes above beyond call duty scouring back catalog songs play . ( if you're like me , means you might miss " pitselah " but feel comforted someone out there much more devoted appreciative elliott smith fan than you'll ever . ) it shame this sort thing doesn't happen more often . then again , there aren't too many modern musicians respectable enough deserve o'riley treatment	1
there reason why every review this disc gives it 5 stars . because it truly example classic live document one rock more creative groups - supertramp . song selection well placement execution , makes this one no-brainer . no . you know what makes this one no-brainer ? it great live disc . so often i hear live disc i'm turned off because ' magic ' somehow eludes live reproduction . this definitely not case paris . top shelf walk down memory lane , when roger hodgson still graced stage supertramp	1

intro this album listener immediately sent into " space-age orbit " this remarkable duo . i am convinced this intro track made listener unwind , spark up blunt after long day or pour yourself drink get your mind ready this space-age vibe . though i feel track 2 " we started this " should not first song record it still shows strong character eighball mjg their stance hip hop culture need some saviors . track 3 , " paid dues " little more like what fans come expect these two , witty , rythmically tight flows meaning which i feel missing today hip hop . my opinion highlights this record track 4 , " it how it go " , track 7 , " daylight " , track 8 ...., track 13 " throw your hands up " , my favorite song record , featuring badass guest appearance outkast classic , last but not least final cut , track 14 " speed " . i recommend this record anyone out there who likes rap , eightball mjg become one my favorite rap groups without doubt . i tend favor mjg delivery but not say eightball slippin ' , not all , thats just my opinion . bottom line , these two real mc gift this rap thing , check it out	1
this great album great band . if you not heard it you missing something quite special . i suppose back 80 lot us fell victim punk dogmas wrote this band off , just shows how unfree we all , sign conformity . but looking back this one some enduring qualities make it stand out . this 25th anniversary edition some extras almost compensate cost , not good value 25th anniversary edition london calling , but worth putting your collection . i think this best first 5 lp but i must admit i not listened anything damned after strawberries lp . tracks really stand out me ones original so i not think any extras trump what it , although there cover old song sweet , ballroom blitz , rips arse . plan 9 channel 7 , melody lee , smash it up parts 1+2 i suppose noise , noise , noise tracks really stand out - but what i say them ... so , yeah , its good , buy it if you	1

david byrne albums always seemed go unnoticed , uh-oh , this truly crime . this album so diverse colorful it really deserves some recognition . help lot different musicians instruments , this very bright happy album . comical opener , quot ; now i'm your momquot ; starts out bit off-beat ( musically subject matter ) , but includes wondefully rhythmic chorus . other highlights include quot ; girls my mindquot ; , which byrne vocal delivery extremely reminiscent latter days talking heads , which cool hear . quot ; hanging upside downquot ; features enjoyable fun lyrics driving guitar throughout . quot ; cowboy mambo ( hey lookit me now)quot ; very jumpy tune which truly captures essence ' uh-oh ' . album closer , quot ; somebodyquot ; , also probably its best track very epic large feeling which ends this album perfectly . get this album now	1

there no denying red octopus one most successful commercial albums ever produced previously counterculture band . this second official release jefferson starship , paul kantner , grace slick , marty balin company boldly toss off last vestiges jefferson airplane era stride boldly into world mid-70s corporate rock . much i truly despise genre , i'd say red octopus manages achieve rare intersection broad commercial appeal quality . what song more symbolic era than miracles ? perhaps only reconstituted fleetwood mac early buckingham-nicks era comes close commercially evoking mid-70s spirit album oriented rock radio . blatantly commercial appeal miracles , i still like it . line " i taste real world ( just drop it ) , when i went down you girl " one most daringly suggestive lines day also one most pointedly passionate . it still sounds way today full version miracles song which i never tire . large , rest red octopus very enjoyable album . never grace slick voice rang out more confidence authority . addition miracles , my favorites fast buck freddy , al garimasu , play love , i want see world , instrumental sandalphon which briefly evocative procol harum . i enjoy bonus tracks well , although shortened version miracles just doesn't it me . play papa john creech musicality pete sears add much aural appeal red octopus . i agree reviewer florida who feels red octopus constitutes apex creativity jefferson starship band . it all downhill here it especially painful hear depths which they ultimately sunk execrable " we built this city " . if i recommend one album jefferson starship , red octopus only one which i give enthusiastic recommendation . not only it good , but it bargain price well . now i've rediscovered it , it never gather dust .	1
i also love this cd ! i used cassette , but no more . anyone willing sell this cd me , please let me know . i also cd player i record cassette or cd if someone willing let me borrow it short time	1

im not writing review talk how old atmosphere better than new atmosphere because i enjoy new one but i just wanted clear up this " hardvolume " oppinion how everyones mad changes they've made group . people not mad change sound atmosphere , fact most dedicated atmosphere fans very pleased production delivery newer releases , its just lyricism takin ' backseat superb production . overcast without question one better debut hip hop records ever . topics great , lyrics clever , hooks catchy without cheesy beats dope . contrary what some people believe becoming more popular doesnt mean underground heads won't like you anymore . i think your favorite atmosphere cd always one got you into them alot us it this one	1
i first heard eroica trio performing austin symphony orchestra , playing beethoven triple concerto . they incredible . but when i hear them again san antonio , performing pieces mendelssohn arrangement bach violin sonata ( chaconne ) , my jaw dropped floor . amount energy passion they enormous . they ended concert encore vocalise ( which this cd ) -- whole audience so quiet pin drop heard ( texas audience never this quiet ! ) :) simply amazing . i'm definitely fan now	1
i very enthusiastically called this cd one best cd 1990 . sure , i listen lot classic rock soundtrack music ( odd combination , i know ) , may not best expert here ( ok , get your " unhelpful " buttons ready ) , but there something charming , sophisticated , gorgeous brilliant going here . i haven't heard cd gets everything so " right " all right places . mr. enigk put together something far surpasses his contemporaries nails 1960 pop british psychedelia some downright heart wrenching vocal performances . i mention orchestral instrumentation impeccable ? ok , i'll stop gushing , but i think you get picture . even most jaded feel heat tracks " explain " " shade black hat " . treat yourself this one .	1
if you looking rising tide part ii , this ain't it , honey . i found this record lacking traditional pop melody sensibilities made trt so special beautiful . prog ? probably . sweeping , passionate beautiful ? probably not . sometimes i get jeremy voice alone , i frog prince . this time i took cd over " sell your stuff " store	1
i read lot this , thought it couldn't good . it . " waltz debby " even finer . this genius work .	1
this undoubtedly my favorite cd last decade definitely sarah brightman best effort date ! her duets andrea bocelli jose cura outstanding ! i especially love ' o mio babbino caro ' , alleluja ' , ' la wally ' . sarah uniquely sensual style evident incredibly beautiful ' bilitis - generique ' , ' no one like you ' ' just show me how love you ' . close your eyes drift away ... it highly unusual me like every song cd , but ' time say goodbye ' , i . it unique way making me feel completely relaxed while encouraging me sing same time . it long past time sequel this wonderful album	1
i don't know you but i bought this cd based potential i heard their first cd puzzle . cd spots greatness spots what i would call good music . man i blown away this cd . it taken tahiti 80 sound gone step beyond . it retained all elements greatness i heard their first cd added it spades this cd . i would say song get yourself together worth price cd alone . there many other spots well . i would recommend listening this great effort headphones it full great sound particuarly well recorded . if i forum list my top 10 2002 it would certainly it . very highly recommended cd indeed	1
one most wonderous moments this album when final clang clamor " out this world " end gorgeous ballad " soul eyes " begins . words fail . coltrane masterpiece . every track standout cut . brilliant touching recording overflows confidence joy displays ( again ) seemingly bottomless well talent this legendary jazz group . classic	1
nazareth one my favorites since 1975 when i heard quot ; hair dogquot ; , their 5th album . but these quot ; greatest hitsquot ; should've called quot ; some greatest hits , some not allquot ; i would slap hands people who composed this stuff ... not again . only one third out 18 songs deserves called quot ; greatestquot ; , others too far . it looks like compilation assembled whatever songs available producer . this crappy approach which allows quot ; novicesquot ; nazareth fans get easily disappointed . i composed 3 (!) my own quot ; greatest hitsquot ; cds nazareth tunes ... it seems producers not familiar nazareth 30-year efforts all . only tunes 3 , 6 , 8 , 11 , 12 , 15 maybe 18 may present nazareth one best groups 70 thru 90 . sad experience ..	1

son volt " trace " fantastic album , especially those you who enjoy fantastic lyrical story telling . music lyrics , while certainly melancholy times dark depressing , paint pictures love lost , loneliness , sadness , desperation , which makes so compelling enjoyable listen . i discovered son volt via internet radio station immediately intrigued their sound . it tough pigeon-hole son volt into particular genre . their sound amalgamation country , rock , little punk , often categorized under " alternative county " heading . fans uncle tupelo , jay farrar early band wilco frontman jeff tweedy should find " trace " just enjoyable , if not more so , than any uncle tupelo release . it tough pick favorite song ; all album strong . album open tune " windfall " conjures up image lonely soul driving down empty highway middle nowhere , running away something . " tear stained eye " country-influenced song tells loneliness , its haunting lap steel guitar fiddle , beautifully accompanied banjo . " ten second news " gem loneliness isolation . just when you start settle into country influence , jay farrar company turn amps guitars up loud heavy " route " minor aor hit , " drown " . this great album start finish . if you enjoy uncle tupelo , ryan adams , wilco , kelly willis , even neil young , you'll definitely love son volt " trace "	1
i fan drive-in , when band fractured into sparta more popular mars volta , i investigated both new bands . mars volta certainly become more well known ; their style bizarre , experimental art-rock/psychedelia/fusion/whatever interesting , but i seriously think this album their counterparts sparta one great underappreciated alt-rock albums all time . pop-inflected , atmoshpheric , creative , otherworldy , artistic , catchy , gritty , expressive .... these all way i could describe this amazing addictive album . both more coherent more well-written than anything mars volta ever ; it really shame this album didn't receive more attention music-buying public . me , this band sunny day real estate veritable apogee alt-rock/emo sound , different ways , without some annoying pretense smug hipness some other bands genre . i still can't get this one out my cd player . modern obscure classic	1
i am person extremely catholic taste music . but , up ' til now , i've reacted so-called " world beat " music i would if i'd seen coffee stand advertising fair trade shade-grown organic blend : i'd conclude their heart right place , then run quickly other direction . i stumbled upon tinariwen completely accident . robert plant compiled music cd british music magazine , his old blues favorites , he included " imidiwaren . " track not only stand-out favorite , it total earworm . i broke down ordered radio tisdas sessions , several months later , it still top my playlist . somewhere way , i also picked up tinariwen other cd , amassakoul ( also incredible ) , am currently obsessively seeking out any track i possibly find this incredible band . what i say music ? i know next nothing band itself , actually learned lot reading several highly informed reviews here . needless say , i can't make heads or tails band lyrics ( though this point , i'd love find lyric sheet , so i sing ) . it haunting , but funky , crazy danceable rhythms badass electric guitars . i'm also very taken call-and-reponse style vocals -- it sounds like virtually everone band sings one point or . think sly family stone without chick who only scream . all i say , when we visited tunisia few years back , i desperately hoping encounter music like this ( though we actuality confronted sublimely terrible eurodisco music every point ) . oh , i also found this completely righteous organic coffee blend ...	1

boy , they weren't kidding when atlantic issued this album originally back ' 68 . it surefire winner start . her third album atlantic proved her talent gospel vocal style could not ignored . " chain fools " good opener . she then cuts out james brown " money won't change you " raw vitality , then churchy " people get reday " . she takes this impressions ' classic blows roof off great improvisatory gospel vocal spot . listen see what i mean . " niki hoeky " indeed catchy ; good bass guitar line , too . then we classics " natural woman " " since you've gone . " listen one ; it sounds like she sings " cinnamon gum " every time she sings title . " good me i am you " bluesy line aretha telling it like it eric clapton doing good guitar feature . then she cuts out ray charles ' " come back " peps one up , quite well rascals ' " groovin '" . finally , we close " ain't no way " ; my personal favorite whole album . what milestone song especially high wailing soprano background which i believe cissy houston . man , oh , man , soul . bonus material includes unedited , longer version " chain fools " , which longer 2 more minutes . it 1 minute intro , added verse , lyrics you're used hearing them placed differently . again , this non-chopped up version . then mono single versions " natural woman " , " since you've gone " its flip " ain't no way . " if there any album made aretha franklin household name , it sure this . you believe it . ever since i got atlantic rhythm blues box set , i've wanting dig deeper into some artists ' music . aretha , i've heard " lady soul " album , decided start there . i wasn't let down , neither you	1
