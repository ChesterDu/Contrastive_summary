i am mother two elementary aged children who love art projects . this christmas gift i never so disappointed quality this item . it arrived crayons broken ones weren't , you couldn't even use paper . markers dry caps don't stay . this terrible product price ridiculous !!! definitely would better off purchasing these items elsewhere !!	-1
i bought this game my new family christmas . this not all game life i remember playing countless hours child . first all , my old game all mountains , houses , spinner permenantly attached game board . new version , all these things attached each setup , which takes 10-15 minutes they easily knocked off board . also , spinner hard spin frequently comes off its pivot . cars less sturdy people pegs not stay car so you constantly put people back car . finally , rules game gotten more complicated yet meaning game become more trivial . i think i put this top closet or yard sale go find my old version game play future	-1
it seems like nice complete set playfood , except boxes really flimsy cardboard , i've thrown most them out already . it doesn't take much crush them . there much nicer sets out there , there separate pieces sold ebay , probably used but stand test your kids much better . not worth money	-1
we very unhappy this toy . speakers distored music sounded awfu	-1
when putting together mobile section this item , i very disappointed its flimsiness . it looks like just few knocks cause screws break plastic . when i turned it i disappointed second time , this time irritating buzzing sound mobile makes it rotates . it so loud you can't hear music , which shame because i'm sure my son would enjoy looking moving lights . third disappointment - buttons very hit-and-miss . sometimes music buttons don't work ( lullaby one worked eventually once i mashed it really hard ) . i could live , but it fiddling other controls really irritating . control music off , lights on/off rotation on/off all seem tied up two buttons . if you music lights going , then turn rotation , music lights go off rotation comes . then you press buttons whatever order seems logical until you get them all going way you want them . please bear mind i am not particularly daft - i managed figure out my tivo remote day or so - but controls this baby musical mobile make no sense me . i thought first it supposed deliberately challenging order stimulate ' baby natural curiosity ' , but after two nights it really got my nerves , if i can't figure it out , i don't see how my one year old supposed . i only think there something very screwed up circuitry there . i'm not dismissing this item all together . music lovely - not too simplified not too electronic-sounding . minute waltz particularly nice ( i've noticed my son scans it ) . lights lovely too , look pretty when they're moving if you stand buzzing . my son come depend music amuse himself he falls asleep . but , if you buy it , i'd recommend testing buttons motorized rotator before screwing very flimsy mobile pieces together case you need return it .	-1
i asked my sister buy this bike my daughter xmas last year - she decided buy one my nephew also since he same age my daughter ( 2 yrs old time ) . she bought two bikes same time , same model , same color , same store . my daughter , who far more coordinated then my nephew , tips over very easy , my nephew seems fine . my daughter taller may where difference lies . perhaps height child using trike what causing trike tip easily . not sure - but i know i regret she ever got bike -it total waste money	-1
i wouldn't waste my time buying anything this company . we purchased train table christmas gift while assembling it christmas eve there quality issues . several drilled holes not drilled proper position table surface several deep scratches . i called e-mailed company several times try obtain replacement parts never got response . most companies want you contact them when you need replacement parts rather than returning it store , but not kidkraft	-1
my daughter drink wet doll she could give bath but it filled up water even though you couldn't empty all water out , it still leaked everywhere . i got rid it hoping she wouldn't notice . well , she , so new " doll i give bath " her christmas list . i wanted find solid rubber doll would not fill up water . like dolls i child . i thought this would it since top half visible box appeared no holes . wrong . it soft torso filled polystyrene beads get waterlogged . water all ( i hope ) drains out bottom feet after couple minutes squeezing . then you let torso drip dry . last night after bathtime , my daughter wanted tuck her doll into doll cradle , but couldn't because she still we t.t he other features fine . shower works great . you don't fill up fish . just attach it tube squeeze . it suctions water bottom floaty . doll doesn't sit upright floaty , but she doesn't flop completely over , either . i don't care bow sewn head . who takes bath bow ? but if you take it off , she'll holes her head	-1
just like big chunk us right now , i'm quite sudoku addict . i just can't put those little puzzles down ! so , i tell you first , if you haven't worked sudoku puzzles yet , you really missing out ! get your hands some ! naturally , i excited try out sudoku game race against my friends solve puzzles . but what disappointment ! one small board , several people straining see it , everyone racing fill puzzle ... it just doesn't work . way they designed this game board , which puzzle solved , number tiles you distribute evenly amongst players . everyone rushes fill puzzle , person who uses all their number tiles first winner , assuming puzzle solved correctly . first all , if you more than 2 people playing , players aren't all going able see board well . some people going board upside-down trying solve it . that rough ! talk getting confused 6s 9s ! plus , everyone hands way while they're laying their tiles , which makes it really hard see concentrate puzzle . next , inevitably games i've played someone lays tile wrong . then whole game thrown off . instructions say if someone rids themselves their tiles but placed them incorrectly , then next person finish would win provided all their tiles correct . most likely , if one person made error , caused chain reaction next person tiles also placed wrong , not necessarily fault either players . it could anyone who started chain reaction . format just doesn't work this game . my advice pass this particular game . perhaps game where people racing side-by-side same puzzle , but their own puzzle , would work better	-1
i should bought my girls ipods . yes , these mini-muddles cute they fit into little girl purses pockets , but that where novelty ends . first , it not abundantly obvious children how work controls get where they want . these kids crimy sakes ! they needs controls clear easy . my youngest no idea how get particular song because buttons never what she thinks they should ( that big hint hasbro ... don't design product adults point view . design it child their point view . button multiple functions very confusing kids ) . so i end up constantly mash those itty-bitty buttons until i figure out where song her . second , process getting music point point ( point mini-black-hole ) not quick easy process . copy here , burn there , transfer this spot , drag/drop who knows where . oy vey . then you discover music isn't correct format so you start all over again . 128 worth space ... 128 piddly amount space but it clearly advertised packaging this amount you're going get . no surprises there . now if i could only get darn music into player without giving up chuckin ' it dog play . ipod might expensive , but apple certainly doesn't cause this consumer grief frustration hasbro	-1
my wife i not impressed caterpillar tunnel . material flimsy light weight . tunnel small our children ( even our 1-year-old ) couldn't crawl through it without making toy twist roll over . since it not what we expected , we decided return it get our money back	-1
compared sound sensation blocks i bought together my 3-month babies , this product almost ignored them .	-1
don't get me wrong ... concept this toy if fantastic ... when it works it wonderful .... however , it sucks up so many batteries it not even funny ! it requres 4 batteries we replace them least every 3 weeks ! not only but there something wrong toy makes it stick " " position even after you turn it off ( very loud sqeaky " . v-tech knows this problem but tell you when you call " take batteries our turn it off 20 times reset it " . well , work few times but then toy totally broken . ... their idea you send it them they take 2 weesk send you replacement .... hmm .... this not toy marketed help children sleep ... so we obviously need it bedtime ! i offered apy them up front new one they could reimburse me but they would not bend . needless say i am quite frustrated v-tech !!!!!!!!!!!!!! if they know it problem they should tell you first call so something it !!! creepy side note .... thing says " i love you " some strange voice your child ...... scary ! v-tech great idea here it best toy its type ... however , it doesn't work .... looks like they came out technology bit too soon ! btw ... i rated durability 1 amazon it showing 3 stars ... hmmmm !	-1
i would not recommend this product anyone over 3 1/2 years ( unless small their age ) . my 4 yr old son ( 36lbs ) got it his birthday , broke steering wheel within 10 minutes . there plenty room him seat inside car , but its " parked " since broken . i wish we would spent money something would lasted . plastic seems cheaply made . voice buttons noises loud work well . stickers already started flake/peel off after 1 month . consider bigwheel	-1
my daughters little young this toy aren't into it yet . it very cute , lots sweet , tiny , realistic pieces , i see it lots play value somewhat educational . however , they made it so arms jointed order she hold baby . well , my daughter threw doll floor doctor office bottom half arm fell right off . even if it hadn't broken , you place arms just right or they look totally strange . this least favorite barbie my girls own . if it weren't arms , this would great toy . oh , back dresser open , so you can't really store small pieces it . not sure why they didn't just close it up make storage easier .	-1
this horrible edition this game . it limited amount games it doesn't play like tv game all . save some money buy old boxed editions [ ... ] or get newest version ... you'll like it lot more .	-1

i'm not going go into my childhood , or how i love transformers or any stuff , i just wanted give quick review . always , you get what you pay . i bought this today within five minutes transforming it one joints popped out i can't life me get it sit correctly back socket . bottom line it very cool ten dollars get you g1 inspired astrorain or starscream , but aware these feel very flimsy definately better utilized sitting your desk work robot mode than transformed back forth while you bored watching tv . very cool , very flimsy , very inexpensive	-1
i bought this toy my three-yr-old . she excited , but then one dolls fell apart , its pelvis broke legs fell out . super glue might fix it , but i'm not sure . i'd recommend it older child who wouldn't play it so roughly . but price , i wanted it last more than three days	-1
this gift my 2 year old last christmas . screws they provide put wheels no good . soon your child starts " walk " his new dog , wheels completely unscrew , which terrible choking hazzard . we tried everything keep them . plus leash tore off around poor spot neck , no type glue seems keep it . i'm afraid this cute little toy going into trash . it good idea cute toy , but not worth money . you're better off buying plastic , already put together one .	-1
i think this product needs lot hands-on supervision . my son slipped off knocked wind out himself twice 2nd day trying this . after couple weeks , he finally regained his confidence try it when friend over -- his 6 y.o. friend slipped knocked wind out herself ( almost call paramedics ) . knowing what i know now ... i would not buy this product kids under 8 ( follow age recommendations !!!!! ) . i would like take pair wire cutters cut it down ....	-1
you get old vintage aggravation games ebay 10 or less theres also some hand-made wooden boards well . these new versions dont hold candle old ones , just old tvs seem better than some new ones	-1
this item came mail my 4 year old son i very excited . i guess we should read description more carefully because i wasn't expecting so many tiny little pieces . we used ticky tack began tedious process sticking different sized stars such all over his room . we waited night see glowing celestial extravaganza . we kept light some time ' charge ' glow dark element then turned off light . what we found nothing close amazing . glow fairly dim only lasted very short period time . we even turned blacklight them all make them glow little brighter but , again , glow only lasted 10 -15 minutes . i ended up going back online buying glow dark paint star shaped sponge . we dabbed stars all over his ceiling . these glowing stars last most night our friends family think his room really cool	-1
this big my 8 year-old son christmas list , mainly because ben 10 game . he even wanted it more than any other game system . although i wasn't pay full price it , we got it 60% off main console . so we got it , paid extra controller , ben 10 game cd , couple ben 10 booster packs . unwrapping hit , excitement first play-through went over great my son . but i noticed right away it not going last . game itself contains graphics 10 years ago . game play difficult , both my son i would find it easy die , thus restarting game both us . you only play characters happens come your game or booster packs , that not many . ( want more ? fork out more $$$ more booster packs . ) finally , it takes so long load cd ( it load every level ) it must 1x drive . seriously slow . although my son still loves idea it not admitted he disappointed , he comment how slow it , how he wishes he other kids trade cards so he could get more . apparently we only suckers buy it around here . it hasn't played but maybe 4 times one month since christmas . if you notice it huge discount , it may worth it . but remember , you pay extra more cards . personally , i wish we'd bought used gamecube few cartridges . way more staying power than hyperscan	-1
when i bought this toy , i thought it soooo cool . but it really doesn't anything it supposed ! it just makes annoying crying whining noises not sound real . even if i tickle its tummy it just whines cries . not , i repeat , not buy this toy !!!!	-1
pros : very cool toy/model 12+ extra time their hands . cons : too many microscopic pieces count . very little room open play . requires extreme caution playing it because propeller other pieces fall apart slightest breath . not appropriate under 7 , least . first just let me say my son loves lego duplo blocks spends hours creating all kinds different designs them . he begging " big boy " legos , i turning him down , pointing out recommended ages box , ( knowing i would picking up infinite numbers tiny pieces throughout house next 18+ years ) . ages they put box seem purely arbitrary , based this particular toy . well-meaning relative decided bless him this present his 5th birthday . ( i seeking revenge soon they children . ) i spent next several hours constructing this nightmare , which itself defeats purpose building toy , my opinion . i no idea where they idea this appropriate 5-year-old , given it challenge me put this together . given amount microscopic pieces this toy , one wonder who designs these things if they children their own . so much it seems purely sadistic . when helicopter finally assembled ( i warned him one only time i putting it together ) , my son spent some time playing it , only constantly frustrated fact pieces constantly popping off , particularly propeller , this very gentle play . bottom line , if you child under 10 , they would probably many more hours play if you just bought lot inexpensively priced lego blocks ( various types ) they could make into all kinds different designs . these expensively priced city lines like really neat once built , but then it just like very fragile model . once you've spent time constructing it , you really don't want take it apart , so i'm not really sure why you would buy this over traditional model . i guess i miss point .	-1
excellent product ! i really appreciate option choose any 50 given mystery cases solve . after playing all 50 , you just start all over again ! fun , fun , fun game ! thanks	-1

i bought this my 8 year old . although it took adult read , understand then teach rules play , once we got basic ( classic ) game figured out , it easy . there advance game too , but it too complicated us . we enjoyed it lot , it makes you plan some thinking , where put your ships . my son always wants more more more when it comes battleship . game talks , it closes up carrying handle . makes it more money than other versions , but it well-made worth price	1

got this toy my daughter christmas . both she my son loved it , but it only comes 8 or so pieces cardboard you go through them quickly . i bought refills , which hard find locally they also last 5 minutes . other reviewers said , get your own cardboard , any neon color works well , use one original pieces stencil cut them out . it much cheaper than buying refills if you don't mind little bit extra work . i bought regular cardboard which curled up after they came off toy , but we put book them when they dry flatten them out . cleaning isn't too bad either . just couple papertowels voila ! it clean ready used again .	1

this game loads fun . i got it my eighth birthday . i thought myself " oh , it one those stupid board games again , " but it wasn't . i'm 10 now , i'm still playing yahtzee . i like it because how much thinking involved , you make impartant decisions , like " hmm ... should i put my score 4 kind , or my fours up top ? " skill also help you way school . but you know what , most games educational boring . but not yahtzee ! yahtzee also fun because excitement you while hoping get yahtzee , which worth fifty points , which most points you get . you always feel happy when you roll something you know good ! now , i don't deluxe edidtion yahtzee , but i'm sure if i liked regular yahtzee , delexe edition would even better . i hope you order this game soon . those you out there who don't want buy yahtzee , because you think you too cool or too old it , you don't know what you're missing !!	-1

i read these reviews online before i purchased this . i selected this bin toy organizer because other ones i looked issues safety it very important me know this type organizer going safe . i really like mission oak style this organizer ... we put it our living room it looks nice ( toys all it ) . better then big plastic toy chest we used ! shelves bins all easily accessible my 19 month old dd loves take things down shelf or carry bin her play area dump it all out . first i thought bins bit too small practical , but now she carries them around i actually appreciate fact they smaller . they easier her handle it means there less she dumping out ! after reading reviews this organizer , we made sure we read directions carefully it important get it right . otherwise , my husband thought it very easy put together he said it really nice design .... much easier then most her toys ! additionally , knowing hardware hidden buckets also helpful . i would definitely recommend this piece furniture ... it last long time get lot use	1

i would disagree other posters i think it greg singing .. i also don't think it loud .. we love it just way it . well minus one flaw .. if it used " dance mat " one would assume your child could dance it .. not really case unless you want hear songs start over over again or new ones startin everytime they move . whenever they jump hit mat again songs start over .. me irritating . we try make game out it . we tell them which characted " squish " then they jump side dance around it .. it great travel toy . we got ours christmas gift last year it fl twice nana house few times too .. it folds up like blanket you just shove it wherever cords ( or whatever making it work inside ) never mess up .. my boys always jumping it pressing different characters i only changed batteries once . we it over year ! so too impressive .	1

story " hansel gretel " obviously warning against children talking strangers . but it also argument against eating someone house story represents triumph poor working class characters over witch her upper class pretensions . but my marxist leanings more groucho than karl , so i am not inclined think deep thoughts particular direction . original manuscript story siblings referred little brother little sister . brothers grimm chose hansel because it common name german fairy tales ( their equivalent john doe so speak ) picked gretel essentially same reason ( which makes her jane doe ) . then again , your ability identify twisted fairy tales version hansel mcfarlane toys probably going limited fact he trapped cage fattened up witch when she cooks him up main course . hansel comes 7 1/2 inches tall , although figure itself 3 inches tall stuck his cage . actually he 3 inches tall when you remove him cage , which point you discover he articulation his neck , biceps thighs . matter , you really cruel take away his boner . meanwhile , candy cane base chain pulley guides play well , but careful because this not toy ( well , okay , it toy , but it not kind toy ) . twisted fairy tales fourth series mcfarlane monsters , rest menagerie consists not only hasnel gretel , now redone german princess , but also red riding hood , peter peter pumpkin eater , little miss muffet . if you aware probable origins lot classic fairy tales then you already knew mother goose twisted sense humor . these figures mcfarlane toys certainly takes twisted next level . even if you not want entire set , there should one these figures captures jungian dark side tales we all raised once upon time most appeals you	-1

this , fact , anti-nerf hoop . whole point nerf hoop simplicity safety it . but this toy takes many batteries , some hoop some ... ball ! i mean , what point nerf ball weighs two pounds ? it breaks things and/or hurt if it thrown too hard . it lands loud " thump " i yell not throw it walls . what point basketball doesn't bounce ? it hits floor " thud " stays there . okay , it cool it lights up , but big deal unless you're playing after bedtime . i wish i bought one flimsy rings you suction-cup door , soft , squishy ball you could bounce off your sister head . i wish amazon sold them ! i wish nerf still made them ! this over-developed toy doesn't give my kid half pleasure it could . ( don't get me started how hard you push turn light ball , or what pain it open battey compartment .	-1

i recently purchased this jeep my two daughters , ages 5 2 , they both love it ! it perfect first ride-on toy them . speed setting slow enough ( 2.5 mph ) so they learn how drive vehicle safely , there faster setting ( 5 mph ) increase speed once they get accustomed vehicle . parent , i very pleased ease assembly . like most parents , i don't like spend great deal time putting my childrens ' toys together . happily , i able assemble jeep 90 minutes . instructions very detailed illustrations clear easy follow . pieces fit together neatly everything slides correctly into its proper slo t.t he jeep loaded fun accessories . there working radio clock plays cd , there colorful decals really brighten jeep up . jeep stops automatically once child lifts their feet off accellorator pedal ( nice safety feature ) . only disadvantage ( its slight one ) length time it requires charge battery . initial charge requires 18 hours plug-in time , each successive charge requires 14 hours . owner manual suggests charging battery after each use , but i've found unnecessary . it driven approximately 20 hours before charge required . i recommend this jeep very highly . construction durable assembly quick easy . two children ride same time , so it won't long before your children driving off their own fun adventures	1

these blocks great fun . each block something interesting inside it . our house these played boys pretty roughly times . windows see inside still clear not one these blocks broken . so i would say they sturdy hold up well normal play . this set my particular favorite transportation set . animals very cute . ends each block texture . within each block something interesting . many blocks activity associated it- push button make noise , twist knob make something turn around etc . one thing i would warn these blocks not stack well , particularly tall towers . so if you thinking buying these tower building , i'd consider different set blocks . otherwise , these excellent toys . they provide basis communication vocubulary building your child . they sturdy encourage language , eye hand coordination so . if you enjoy toys fairly quiet , more than push button make noise , foster independent creative play exploration world this excellent toy . enjoy .	1
my parents brought this back berlin 1960s taught my sister i how play when i became teenager . this year , i found it taught my wife how play . she hooked . we're hyper competitive , so each hand last half hour we trash each other hazzards . our kids get older , we'll use this fun sharpen their on-the-spot math skills . ( but we won't tell them that!)it simple but addictive .	1

these shake go cras lots fun . you simply shake depending how much or how little force used determine how far these guys go . using off button while not use seems lengthen life batteries we still not replaced them after months use . amusement value even greater when these cars used multiple children ( or adults ) they raced . change dynamics fun when you take them outside they tumble bounce back all different types terrain we just recently discovered . overall this cute fun little toy . i might stretching but ihink there some educational value this car child must learn more force they epend when shaking further car go , kinda like physics ? so all all cool little toy reasonably priced	1

sea-monkeys cool , this set also cool , but own sea-monkeys , you need very serious it , you need care them always , if you forget feed them once , or oxygenate them , or even tiniest thing , they die , this happened my sister i second time , this time they died after five days ! so , i guess before you buy this set , you should willing take full responsibility your little aquatic pets , perhaps make schedule feeding , oxygenating , etc . your pets . hope this helps	-1

i just bought this character toy ( toy collector ) i am impressed . it true some words tj says pronounced differently than they should , but character refers himself five years old it seems make sense me . lot people comparing tj bearytales teddy ruxpin - collector animated childrens ' toys - let me tell you just opening tj first time , he far more interactive than teddy ruxpin - teddy ruxpin costs more less .	1
i bit nervous what this toy would bring given other reviews , but since my 3-year old this top his list christmas , it must . it fairly easy assemble , although pieces fall apart if you try pick it up move it . mat 4 feet long made thick , flexible vinyl . it not painted garbage bag one review indicates . my pins not come off , ball return works well . maybe these things improved since those reviews . when i first set it up , ball return not working , but since christmas day it suddenly started working hasn't broken since then . only minor disappointment balls don't fingerholes them like picture shows . scoring unit works well . it set 1 or 2 players . if you miss , you manually push " missed ball " button . it keeps score based six pins ( there 6 this game , not 10 ) . final frame ( frame 6 ) if you get strike , you get 12 points ; if you get spare you get 9 . you don't get bowl " extra " balls final frame . therefore , scoring bit weird , max score 102 . otherwise , it scores like regular bowling . tubes sides attach mat velcro . they don't quite match up perfectly , but good enough hold them place . my 3 5 year old love game operate it themselves . i see how kids few years older would find it boring given fairly small size shortened gameplay ( ie 6 frames/6 pins ) . also , one reviewer notes , hitting head pin any speed almost always gets strike , but even , i've only gotten 1 perfect game . overall , great fun . found sale 40 dollars . i'd say worth if your kid really into play bowling . improvements would more sturdy construction , a/c adapter	-1
this one last 2005 bionicle sets . i it , i think it really fun . i fun building it , i fun playing it . it comes 2 pieces where if you press button , piece shoots out . it comes bunch mini figures . this would great addition any bionicle fan collection	-1

i loved it when i purchased it online it met every expections i this slide . great slide just great design but when slide upright postion locked it very unstable unsafe . it easily knoked over even infant or it just easily tip over when child tries climb it or slide it . you physically hold both carrots your hands keep it stable while child trying play . just one oversight incidence parents , child get hurt . since , i like product otherwise , i am trying figure out way mount legs ground before i allow this used . please not buy this unless you way mount base ground somehow .	-1
santa brought this item my daughter chrismas she so excited get it . she wanted it open soon she recieved it . when we finally got it open everything all set up read instructions nothing it said it worked . hair not change color eyeshadow didn't come off . we tried even using ice cubes instead little curling iron thing came it . still no luck . my daughter still plays it but it not her favorite toy	-1
my husband got this my 2 1/2 year old daughter christmas , while it not perfect , we lot fun it so far ! sure , it takes 10 minutes heat up , but that not big deal . it doesn't make much time , but we just keep adding sugar every minute or so it makes much we want ! it might not fun older child , but toddler , she loves it ! she can't eat it any faster than it comes out anyway ... it great reward her ! we used it today her reward taking nap , she so thrilled	-1
i like swingset fairly well , my daughter seems like it too . it seems very sturdy , well made . my first impression it after i get it all put together " man this small " . slide very little . but price compared others , should somewhat expected . although swingset not difficult put together , instructions not super clear ( you go little tikes website view them ) . also , half plastic covers go over bolts broke while putting them , i very careful them . my biggest problem swingset missing 3 4 pivot joint swing hangers . i called little tikes several times , but they always either closed or lunch . when i finally get through , i would get voicemail told me redial number press different option . i finally get person phone after 12 attempts , told parts i need backorder because swingset so new . so , sum up my experience this set , here my pros cons : pros : sturdy , clean nice looking , fun my two year old , not time consuming put together other sets . cons : instructions vague pictures , no words . pictures screws bolts not actual size ( makes it harder tell if you using right hardware ) , missing parts , replacement parts backorder , very small , customer service difficult get touch . if i it all over , i might would buy this swingset again . even though it small , it still serves its purpose , my daughter loves it	-1

my four year old absolutely enthralled this toy , his 4 month old sister . i bought wand monkey , which i think cutest glo toys , my kid spends huge amount time changing colors monkey across room . if you get this toy around $15.00 , i'd highly recommend it . monkey really soft , but beware getting monkey hair caught velcro ( where toy opens house electrical innards . ) once hair gets caught , velcro doesn't want work very well	1
this great overnight bed grandma grandpa house . my son 2 years old absolutely loves his elmo bed ( well , honest , he loves all things elmo ) . it said it took sheets but it not work fitted sheet . we just put blanket down bottom then my son blanket over him . this bed comes very archaeic foot pump inflate . first time we tried this we not taken our air compressor it took me 45 minutes inflate . next time we portable air compressor it went up 5 minutes . it takes little deflate it also . we took long route first time pinching open valves ( they protected valves so you pinch them take air out ) . second time we took nozzle foot pump , pushed it into valve inflation viola ..... we then able lay bed oursleves deflate . you never get all air out either so we purchased small plastic bin lid storage . over all very good investment though	-1
we gave this our son his second birthday he really enjoys playing it . i guess it only good whatever accessories you get go it - we some plastic dishes some small utensils , it keeps him very busy while i am working kitchen . mostly he puts things oven , takes bowl sink out puts things way , bangs his spatula , etc . it well-made lot play value little space it takes up	1

i purchased both pooh dora dolls my daughter . both dolls her name , but dora only one options pronounciation . her name avery , pronounced " av-ree " pooh only say " a-ver-ee " also when he says her name , his voice drops tone sounds very out place . i also trouble dolls losing time . when i bought dolls , i under impression they able many games , songs , stories all once . ( box says over 100 ) . auctuality , doll only three activities once so you choose song , story , game lists . currently i choosing one activity each list which means i get my computer every week or so change settings so my daughter different thing listen . box should say they over 100 games , stories , games , phrases , just not all once . my daughter enjoys dolls , but me they very aggrevating . my last thought if you purchase doll , sure set daily schedule little ahead your child . i her breakfast schedule set 8am , but mornings when she sleeping little , pooh dora woke her up announcing breakfast . i now it set 9am even though she already up running then	-1

i saw this game advertised winning ' major fun award ' you bet your bottom dollar , this game major fun . you cannot help but fun playing catch 22 . name suggests , you need catch 22 chips exit game board win . but , also name suggests , you might find yourself ' catch 22 ' situation . example , once you win alot chips , everybody else going try catch you steal your chips . or , player might land switch places square when you thought you home free , you forced switch places opponent . strategy part you ' blocker cubes ' try clear path yourself or indeed block opponents path . but careful , you only five cubes once you use them up , you must land square which allows you collect blocker cube board . this simply fantastic game . it fast moving heart stopping . i cannot tell you how many times someone verge winning heart beat , all their chips stolen . really , you should definitely try this game , i highly recommend it if you into fun	1

watching this set take shape probably best part assembling process , outcome great-looking fighter craft . pieces you " click " into place ( sometimes ) make assembly tedious ; it ( sometimes ) hard tell what right number clicks ( i.e. clone scout walker ) . but everything works perfectly here . reason i say watching it come together best because tri-fighter comes tri-assembly , meaning you doing same thing per step , basically , three times ( x3 ) . some people may not bothered this , while others may look more variety step step . nevertheless , it not big problem . buzz-saw droid tri-fighter lone minifig , if you even want call it minifig . only part his body represents true-to-form minifig legs ; rest him just normal lego pieces . i small problem this ( you may not ) because minifigs , me , big part what makes or breaks lego set . but whatever case may , buzz-saw droid rather unique figure , he essentially hidden ship center anyway ( getting him stand up right bit monotonous too ) . putting this 148-piece set together took little over half-hour . i found outstretched beams , this set took up lot space ; i started corner my table wound up clear most space off make room . i said , clicking beams into place very easy , while end-pieces join three efficient you'd expect lego . also , this set fair number small stickers you must apply , whether or not persuades or dissuades you .... so besides lack true minifig number steps times three , tri-fighter great lego set . i highly recommend this , one cheaper episode iii sets one more attractive ones . two shades blue elevated durability -- it noted you drop this high levels not fix thing ; , within reason , true -- make tri-fighter definite steal star wars lego line . give this set " tri " , you shouldn't disappointed	-1
our two half year-old received bug eyed buddies his first kid k'nex toy holidays last year . first thing he create " lollypop " out long rod , circular piece , eye . he so proud himself quickly made one my husband . i excited he could figure out how build them so quickly . over next six months , he building more elaborate structures telling stories them . we've added his kid k'nex collection footed friends , garbage truck gus , lion mouse story pal . he loves them all . bug eyed buddies great beginner set because it enough pieces creative but doesn't cost too much	1

you see my other reviews building toys big hit our home . my boys love legos but they just not into them 24-7 like other lego lovers . so we variety different types . zoobs one well-played sets our home . i use building sets occupy hands minds while eyes glued television . i really dislike idle staring television . so , my solution not take television away , but encourage play while boys shows . over years , my boys become bored " just watching " television rarely ever found just watching . anytime television ourhome , boys sitting playing too . zoobs usually floor arew typically first choice . bright colorful plastic " ball socket " type joints enable child create pose-able articulated figures . i also used these pattern making recognition , well math manipulatives helping boys their homework . 75 not nearly enough though . you need couple sets . ebay great source scoring add ons this set less . we even bring zoobs reataurants us occupy boys while we waiting our food come . ziploc bag works great transporting enough keep family occupied . fine building toy encourages imaginative play ! rosemary bertinelli	1

we bought this after using swim school deluxe tot trainer pants aqua leisure . its awesome allows both us enjoy water , our son just cruises around pool this vest . it not coast guard approved so you cannot use it city or ymca pools . he lessons now but i feel more comfortable him vest while we pool together , since our condo doesn't life guards . if you want more than 3 inches away while your child still learning swim , then this must .	1

i love it comes matching food containers , thermos , separate storage area front . i also love idea thermos design pop-up built-in staw . my son really enjoyed whole package beginning . however , functionality thermos rests flimsy tab plastic flip-open top . ours broke pretty quicky now it won't close all . it rendered useless travel . we've only owned it few months already images badly scratched worn . while i give them points great design ideas , lack durability simply unacceptable . i would not buy one like this again	-1
friend gave me this game birthday present , i'm addicted ! although i love scrabble , i hate playing my husband because he takes so long form words . seven minutes game , wordigo gives players enough time form great words , but not so much time game drags . i also like how i set myself up form high scoring words . different playing boards make very competitive games players differnt skill levels . highly recommended	-1

i bought this my daughter who 2 1/2 . she probably little young it , but reason i got it her because she seems very interested violin . i older daughter , age 10 , who plays violin when she plays , my younger daughter pretends playing " air violin " . since she got this pretty pink violin , she holds it up under her chin pretends play way . she loves princess music very intent what she doing . it too adorable . i afraid bow would become weapon , but she hasn't steered way all . i think she respects instrument . all honesty , violin probably heavier than real violin little cinderella fallen off . i attached it back easily enough . i'm sure when my daughter just bit older we may start " real " violin lessons , but now this perfect .	-1

we grandson marriage , it seems though it long time since we purchased baby toys . when we started looking toys , our first choice experience our children fisher-price . selection toys their sophistication changed lot couple decades since we last bought baby toys . this toy blast . every time you push pad center stable you hear horse whinny . feeding trough side barn makes slurp noise . you get several horses , cart , couple fence pieces , corral piece , bale hay . my only objection it appears there no way connect two fences corral piece one side barn other , so they pretty much connected photograph shows . i guess horses intended run away . i admit i really enjoy horse whinny . our one year old grandson also thought it blast , gets smiles whenever he hears it . he still working exactly how make whinny noise , but he likes it . other hand , whinny drives my wife nuts . we impressed this first purchase little people fisher-price toy plan buy more .	1

puerto rico take you 30 minutes explain it someone . it complex . sure there much more complex games out there , but this probably one most complex popular eurogames market . it this reason it only gets 4 stars . this one greats . if you want game almost no luck tons strategy decent player interaction , look no further . tons options every turn . this slow game bit . great game mechanics everyone selected role affect everyone . this game gets better more you play it same people because everyone begins understand strategy last round first game . bottom line : it better than settlers ? less player interaction , more strategy , slower placed , less luck . add gamers like it ? no way . non strategy gamers like it ? no way . eurogamers like it ? they love it .	1
i really thought my one year old son would love this toy , well he thinks it okay b/c he loves push buttons ( there only one ) , but i don't . i thought gears clicked stacked into place , like legos , making it good toy travel , it even carry handle . well , soon you lift it handle , all gears fall floor . one button it sings same songs over again . it needs go back drawing board .	-1

i happen love webkinz . there lot technical problems but not webkinz side . it depends type computer you . you must computer handle java script ( most but some older computer can't comprehend it ) . sometimes if you trying access sit through aol you may not able because aol hard time handling java script well . i normally access it through internet explorer no trouble all . site lot fun . there numerous games ranging puzzles cards basbeall . there secret recipes children make using there stove . children get express themselves decorating their room pet . you go shopping go hunting gems . there so much it never gets old . i highly suggest buything this someone who knows how use computer . i would not suggest this gift 5 year old but someone around ages 9-13 because site slightly hard navigate ( you get used it ) games challenging .	-1
tons stuff come this set , super price : thomas , cargo train cargo piece , tree , sir topham hat figure , two signs , 3 section bridge , water tower , tracks form figure 8 . if you add up price red water tower , one train attached cargo train , bridge , several track sets accessories , you would price 50-75% more than cost this excellent thomas starter set . this set even worth it if you already other pieces line . my son wanted water tower , i figured why pay price single one , when few dollars more , you get 2 trains , bridge , signs , figure , tree , tons track . while some larger thomas sets don't really save you cash very pricey , this one probably best value out there . one other note , differences red yellow tower not just color . red one , sold itself , train track piece attached it one unit . yellow one this set not track attached , but comes two little magnets front , there one straight track piece two magnets side , so you make it stay put . it may take few minutes when you disassemble it , find right track piece magnet , if you lot track like we , it take several minutes !! way , it better than red one , you place it where you want , even around curve , just using it alone . downside , if you lose magnetic piece track , you won't get it attach anything anymore	1
i bought two packs these balls 9.99 each " wally world " ( you know where i mean ) they great ! we used them fill inexpensive inflatable pool ball pit .

i got this my 18 month old son right after christmas . even though it recommends 2 people put it together i tried put climber part together myself some miracle i succeeded , but it take me 3 hours this . i could've gotten it quicker if i hadn't put couple parts backwards fix them . here helpful hint climber , don't close blue covers until you sure you it correctly correct place . i wasted 5 them because i back track . fortunately company gave me quite few extras . also , someone else mentioned you need power drill make holes plastic screws . far swing set extension goes , there no way one person could themselves , it impossible . some advice part would use bar soap rub it all over two metal poles supposed go into each other above climber . there no way ours moving if we hadn't . it took my mother me 2.5 hours get it complete . also , you most likely need hammer block wood bang few parts into place both climber swing extension . overall , i am very pleased my purchase i know my son get many years use out it .	1
this play set many benefits : it quick assemble ; there no worry splinters or rust ; it attractive toddler eye ; it easy wallet . our 2-year-old loves swings slides , but unfortunately set seems so compact . placement swings extremely close ; thus , it difficult kids avoid bumping into one . also , fort smaller than we expected . still , overall , set worth small investment	1

you play this game regular deck cards . i heard it called " oh hell " , " oh heck " , " up down river " , but its all same thing . you start dealing one card everyone . you go around circle bid either 1 or 0 ( since there only one trick ) . you play trick like any other trick-based game , but you don't play win trick . only restriction you must follow suit . if you get your bid ( 0 valid bid ) , you get 10 points + 1 point each trick you won . if you don't get your bid , you get 1 point every trick well . you deal 2 cards second round , 3 third , etc . until you deal out all cards or many possible number people you playing . you introduce trump flipping top card remaining deck over once you deal . why pay ten bucks this deck when it just regular deck different rules box	-1
we purchased this our boys - ages 5 7 christmas because they really love lego products we got 500 piece set so our four children , ages 5 , 7 , 9 11 could enjoy it together ... once they got started - they something it everyday ! instruction books great visual tool but kids tried lots things their own well . only item i wish different case - it broke first day so we put everything heavy duty plastic bin so it could handle traveling one room	1

my boys really enjoyed playing this toy , however order lower bucket it requires lot wrist strength most 2-4 year olds tried play it not able make it function their own . it even little difficult me get it lower . only other comment i would add regarding this excavator if children not able operate arm makes bucket lower they tend lean forward toy , causing toy tip occassionally child fall face forward into arm excavator . this toy requires lot parental supervision	-1

i play scrabble all time , but more i play , fewer people i want play . we either all know same two letter " scrabble words " or all words use " " but not " u " , or only one us it extremely mismatched . enter upwards . adding dimension game ( ie , you add letters top other letters ) , you not only change " should " " could " but you change " should " " shield " or even something further afield like " tasted . " course , trick make all adjacent words make sense , too . it takes different strategy play upwards than it takes play scrabble . there so many variations what you seven letters , you aren't stuck playing same words over over . you also not encumbered things like triple word score . i play this adults children it always challenge . i highly recommend it anyone over 7 .	1
i really like it . it makes nature sounds train sounds . it really adds atmosphere train set	-1
this very fun game . it little bit learning curve , but after 30 minutes you really get hang it then you enjoy it . board tiles resource cards beautifully designed , random element board makes game different every time . definitely worth money	1
my daughter received this game some years ago . we immediately loved it still play it whenever we visit her . ( she now her 20s ! ) i bought it my nieces ( 12 , 16 17 ) this christmas , they ( their parents ) love it , too . you move like pictionary ; you win square before you move ahead . different colored squares represent different catagories songs . get your team guess song title you hum , whistle , sing " la-la-la " or charades . it real hoot ... there nothing funnier than watching " singer " opposing team realize song he thought he could hum so well his team total mystery them . ( unless it his panicked , last second switch charades hopes victory . ) younger kids might not familiar some catagories or titles ; we either let them go card where they recognize one , or make separate list songs they know choose . if we only 3 people ( not enough people teams ) , we just take turns rolling catagory humming . if someone guesses song , hummer guesser each get point , whoever gets 25 points first wins . this great family or party game . sometimes everyone laughing so much you not only can't hear hummer , hummer can't even hum ! we really recommend it .	1

ghost rider , demon who inhabits johnny blaze ( others also called ghost rider , but this one johnny ) , hellfire filled demon who takes vengeance evil doers . he flaming skeleton wearing leather riding flaming motorcycle . only ghost rider ( gr ) could pull this look off . figure based movie version but they wisely not really alter gr basic design , he'll fit right your marvel legends icons line . detail sculpting his leather outfit , including different textures his various layers closing top notch . zippers his jacket spikes his gloves look great . his skull excellent flames top nice orange yellow clear plastic look really good . while missing couple points articulation i might liked see , most notably any type cut his upper arms allow them turn , what here really well there still plenty it . joints move smoothly tight enough stay put once posed . he stands great his own looks awesome his flaming demon motor cycle . one his accessories nice long chain spike end he looks great wielding it . but main event his bike which might well its own figure . wheels skull handlebar eye hole covered billowing flame . bike itself looks skeletally organic mechanical same time covered detail . this thing super huge takes up lot room . put gr there swinging his chain this one eye popping figure . this five star all around .	1

responce review said customer pictures not rock-a-bye chou chou , you right wrong . lot doll artists what called " reborning " . this where you take factory doll such chou chou , or more commonly berenger , redo it . usually they strip redo all paint , change out body , root new hair , change eyes , etc . it chou chou still , just much more realistic version . if you look pictures they almost always artist name link their website . i'm impressed someone could make chou chou look good	-1
