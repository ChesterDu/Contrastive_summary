horrible family you care nothing , nobody you'd want your own , that saying lot since every family earth dysfunctional . even nutty grandmother makes you want slap her . hell , i really want slap everyone cast , crew , writers . i bought this 5 bucks , it wasn't worth 5 cents . these people unsympathetic , unbelievable , totally made up . women wear too much eye-liner spend most film rolling their eyes each other showing their midriffs . i bought movie because johnathan schaech ( based -- okay -- his pretty face his presence thing you ) , but he not even it much . he better looking than all girls it too -- including phony poser lesbian fabulous midriff when alyssa dumps her . i fast forwarded through this after first half , pausing occasionally hear dialogue made dumb dumber look like hemingway . summation , if you like this movie , you dumbed down evil hollywood machine , i suggest you check out good foreign films like good marriage beautiful scandals like valmont immediately . there no excuse liking unmoving , plastic dreck this nature .	-1

ve2 ton potential , but it just doesn't work out . brandy davis both cute sexy , course , but playboy testing limits much better showcase her , um , talents . not mean , but most film other women just aren't attractive , many sex scenes actually irritating because obnoxious soundtrack . contrary previous reviewer , massage scene fairly ordinary . girl-girl stripper scene most disappointing , however . it starts really well , straight girl gradually overcoming her shyness enjoying stripper , but even unrated version then fades black without any real action . only scene worth watching all blue-collar vignette , two girls one guy hooking up . stay away this one	-1

if you want review plot itself , complete spoilers , feel free read other reviews . my biggest beef this movie fact any suspension disbelief utterly killed , again again , due fact script writers director couldn't keep story straight . there homage asimov shipboard computer telling one crew it not let human come harm . would fabulous if it actually adhered any other part film . there handful these screw ups kills any chance story credible . said , it bit enjoyable . cast fantastic job what they actually given . if writers would spent more time developing characters than finding ways get them naked , maybe i would cared what happened them . dimensional jump effect quite novel one thing this movie made me say , " oooh , cool " . good premise , good effects , good acting , but poor writing killed any chance this good film	-1
transformers gets my vote worst movie 1980 . it pains me say this i am fan series . it travesty see optimus prime ( greatest transformers ) fall battle pass matrix leadership successor ( rodimus prime ) who proved incapable leadership . galvatron pathetic reincarnation megatron -- he lacked malevolent cunning megatron behaved like raving lunatic . why would decepticon warrior follow him into battle ? new generations autobots decepticons introduced movie , they forgettable . it amuses me " fans " raving movie now yet they not pay see movie when it released twenty years ago . transformers failed box office i am glad it . fan , i insulted . perhaps these other " fans " allowed nostalgia blind them ugly truth this outrage .	-1

that basically my two cents . shallow characters , bizarre story . i am not kind person who usually watches romance films , but i like good story heard this one . it not . all characters inverted - ada her daughter utterly irritating , george disgusting start finish , sam neill character ( supposedly heartless jerk ) actually easiest sympathize . how frustrating ! positive note , michael nyman score unbelievable . i love it	-1
it wasnt all bad . it its moments . brad renfro ( bully ) , dominique swain ( face/off ) , keram malicki-sanchez ( tv buffy vampire slayer ) , emily bergl ( rage : carrie 2 ) , justin long ( jeepers creepers ) , james king ( bulletproof monk ) jordan bridges ( mona lisa smile , son jeff bridges ) star camp counslers who , well lot problems . peter stormare ( eight millimeter ) camp nazi he doesnt want anything go wrong his camp . emotions , relationships other crazy shtick happens way . james king ( former model ) looks good dipping lake .. hmm . renfro swain so wrong each other , they should couple real life . bergl hot bone . bridges bastard . long hoot nerdy/geek type characer sanchez nicely cast kid who not afraid show his homosexuality others . stomare just weird , plain weird kids brats . so if you liked heathers , because daniel waters wrote it , then this movie yo	-1

i wasn't expecting much when i dropped this 1998 movie into dvd player ... there lot commend itself . matt damon gives convincing performance wet-behind-the-ears lawyer who finds himself big case his hands just he passes bar exam ! danny devito slimy , shady , sarcastic , sleazy ( other words , perfect devito ) damon partner . main story involves poor family whose son denied needed medical treatment leukemia . sleazy big insurance company denied his claim betting they not press matter . they bet wrong ! our hero , guided some unlikely supporters sympathetic judge ( dixon alias ) , come rescue . pieces fit together quite nicely . justice served , bad guys taken down , matt damon establishes himself unlikely , unwilling hero endears himself pretty girl process . nothing wrong this story or this film . very delightful satisfying every respect .	1

big fan anime comedy ( intelligent , yet lame humor ) i eager see el hazard " magnificent world " . because high price set , i some hesitation ( because some poor reviews amazon ) . well , i say bad reviews wrong . this dvd series totally awesome ( although i admit it started bit slow ) . i promise more you keep watching , better it gets . plot highly intelligent ( involving dimensional time travel ) characters very interesting ( distinctive special powers ) . some say humor el hazard juvenile ( but i would argue no more juvenile then southpark ) , seriously what good comedy isn't juvenile ? some also say story sometimes too redundant ( because many episodes involve doomsday device ) , which i respond " we call original starwars trilogy redundant because they involve death star " ? no , ofcourse not . yes this dvd set lacks some extras , but i think pioneer great job . dvd menu presentation beautiful , box very elegant too . hopefully you get this set around 40 dollars ebay ( beware bootlegs ) . it very hard find good authentic set . sequel " alternative world " which i just ordered , individually should cost around 30 dollars if you shop smart . my fellow anime comedy fans , i also reccomend " niea under 7 " " his her circumstances " . animation = 5plot = 4music = 4characters = 5comedy = 4total = 4.4 star	1
someone well versed various kinds literature , someone who read ( enjoyed ) almost all tom clancy novels , professional videographer , i say , this great flick . those who upset adaptation , what you expect ? when taking 800 plus page book condensing it down two hour movie , some things going change . second third clancy movies- especially clear present danger - also adapted give harrison ford action spotlight . but now ford ageing , paramount ( who after all , business needing turn profit ) needed re-invent franchise . move make it not just new actor , but show it start jack ryan career cleverly . most all , it held true idea book , when we base our actions off our fears suspicions , our peace torn apart few depraved individuals . this movie falls into category action/thriller . such , not everything true life , but instead designed entertainment suspense . it delivers . something action category it remarkably intelligent script . it little slow beginning those who looking nothing more than explosions shootouts , but it worth it . it also better than average cinematography compared most action flicks . effects well not all cheesy , many action flicks taught us expec t.t he acting well-done , typically good performance affleck stellar performance freeman . soundtrack also fantastic , especially rendition national anthem football game . bottom line , if you're reader who expects movies scripts written like books , don't see this movie . if you accept literature movies entirely different formats entertainment then you'll probably enjoy this movie , it certainly worth ownin	1

i always soft spot my heart film adaptations shakespeare . they always labors love , often cribbed together excellent actors technicians working well-below scale just sheer thrill working bard . even less-successful productions , such mel gibson turn prince denmark or recent update " love labours lost " win my affection if not my undying devotion . but i special place my heart few shakespearean adaptations , such kenneth branagh " henry " " much ado nothing , " ian mckellan " richard iii , " even baz luhrmann " romeo + juliet .

lavishly praised critics nominated several oscars , right stuff perfect movie those gung ho , flag waving patriotic gents who beatified us space program birth eventual domination skies . writer/director philip kaufman , working tom wolfe novel , certainly right stuff terms casting , visuals , editing capturing time periods 1947-1963 . rigorous training these seven astronauts also expertly displayed , quest chuck yaeger fastest man earth . exception donald moffat too cartoonish impersonation lyndon johnson , cast exemplary standout turns ed harris , scott glenn , fred ward , pamela reed annie deschanel particularly . sam shepard barbara hershey also dynamite their roles yeagar his wife . movie length frustrating , ending , which seems come out nowhere , but right stuff good moviemaking	1
i using this tape years , it one my favorites . it divided into 3 different sections ; approximately 38 minutes step aerobics , 10 minutes abs/back , 32 minutes hips , thighs , buns . all classes led keli roberts , renowned fitness instructor . step class fun , but challenge , especially if you're new step aerobics . however , each woman video doing modified version , regards height step platform , no step all , or without arm movements , or without light hand weights . keli cuing great , moves broken down where you enough chance learn them become comfortable them before next one taught . same time , there some moves which prove confusing may frustrate someone who new routine , such transitioning across step , repeating routine opposite side before crossing back over again . effect , doing this helps you alternately work each leg , but it might confusing first until you get into flow things . ab section great , 10 minutes just enough time . movements very slow controlled , so you work muscles hard . it probably one my favorite ab routines out all videos i own . lastly , there hips , thighs , buns section . you lot standing leg work ; squats , leg presses , etc . they very tough you may need work up some repetitions . then , there some floor work ; leg lifts both inner outer thighs . usually , i step abs class , or abs legs class . i don't know i'd energy all 3 classes one day . it easier break things up . but nevertheless it great workout	1
honestly beat street best breakin video out there period . this like orgin hip hop music , dancing grafitti this day . storyline alright not going go into details but it send out positive message everyone there even today . honestly just buy movie why read this review !!	1

i'm not sure how they could made 1900 house better . when participants break rules they point out how things would really 1900 . it ludicrous suggest producers could created more context show . so - create lavish social conditions ( more participants , social gatherings , etc . ) - would well beyond scope budget project . viewer response this show versus colonial house also revealing . 1900 house participants broke rules all time - they bought shampoo , they treated maid better than victorian family would , etc . more importantly , father children lives outside home modern era . essentially , these people it easy compared colonial house who mandated zero contact anything remotely modern . it seems critics colonial house political agenda . any all criticisms participants breaking rules this somehow ruining show mindless . living they past , whether it us colonial era or 1900 victorian london , would misery vast majority people living western world . people aren't robots . if you want show where all actors appear follow rules watch fictional drama . but then , all you'll watching professional actors playing part . you won't seeing people live , suffer even enjoy lifestyles past - which whole point making these programs first place . last word : 1900 house , like colonial house , great television adults children alike . it our loss more programs like this aren't produced	1
course , 20/20 hindsight always nice cases like this , but , i huge supporter this film when it still ' against country ' so ... i reviewed it back then ' ' publication , , course , we know , many people lost their jobs over such ' treasonous act ' ... ( fortunately , i not one them ... ) ... but time revealed ( almost ) all bush administration lied get-go lying ever since ... contrary one or two stragglers who still think bush won florida ... knock it off !!!!!!... when ' so-called ' recount , it never took into account all ' illegal ' butterfly ballots candidates names both sides ballot ( which againast florida state law ) , causing many vote pat buchanan accident ... ( no mention disinfranchised democrats who weren't allowed vote due republican strong-arming ... ) , sad fact , now , i would still tell anyone left america wicked ways this administration , just goes prove some , no matter how much truth placed before them , still ignore common sense follow path leads their own destruction ... next time , this country better not wait ' bell curve ' catch up those who already know ..	1

waiting godot dubbed " tragicomedy " there doesn't seem any other word better suited describe this play . random wandering personalities vladimir estragon , main characters , lend amusing air entire work . however , their inability accomplish anything or even grasp what really going around them inspires some sympathy ( irritation ) , though it may weaker or stronger depending how strange book strikes you . unless one goes into waiting godot expecting existentialism it somewhat confusing , may seem bit more pointless than it meant . knowing little bit beckett his beliefs probably make it more enjoyable , but it interesting well written enough stand its own . what i love most this book beckett ability make absurd seem so close reality . vladimir estragon most certainly not your average joe , but lot what they say seems familiar most time rather humorous . waiting gogot really what you make it , because while its core it just story two confused homeless men , it also meaningful slightly endearing tale . go looking meaning , knowing how beckett means get things across , i think this play end up reading much better than if one goes just cold . short read , worthwhile , i would say , least its originality humor	1

i'm familiar most information this movie but i suspect lot people , working middle class ( which i'm part so i know what i'm talking ) not . they too busy watching fox news listening talk radio . i hope enough people who disenchanted bush administration their shrinking personal budget would occasionally watch movie such this . it how media biased because it owned corporate america . how deregulation telecommunications act hurts our nation . they buying up small independent stations . corporate america republicans would love regulate internet because there too much information they prefer we didn't know . they try use some pseudo-intellectual reason censor internet euphemist language ( like they patriot act ) brainwash unquestioning citizens our country . please watch this family member or friend who open or ready re-think their right wing views .	1

macbeth comes japan , although it set feudal times sometimes feel classic noh play , kurosawa borrows freely shakespeare : there prophecies evil spirit ; there lady macbeth feeding fire her husband ambition madly trying wash blood off her hands ; , course , there birnam woods moving toward castle end . toshiro mifune macbeth , final scene he barraged countless arrows classic . isuzu yamada lady macbeth , she puts virtuoso performance frightening proportions . movie very atmospheric - foggy woods , braying horses , eerie musical score - only adds its intensity ; but it also poetic moving its own unique way . it brilliant piece filmmaking .

gift chilling tale set south written billy bob thornton , talented man also wrote sling blade . first off , it impossible anyone give this movie less than 3 stars . why ? because incredible cast . here , you'll find probably one best casts ever . it cate blanchett , hilary swank , greg kinnear , actor whom i can't remeber his name but who brilliant keannu reeves . keannu reeves ? good actor ? damn straight . he brilliant this movie deserved oscar nomination best supporting actor . i am not kidding . his performance remarquable ! movie widow , mother 3 , making her money psychic . but , she gets involved woman whose abusive boyfriend ready anything . this psychic scared mother only seems loved watched over one person . only one . you'll find one out your own . this movie packed suspense me edge my seat . so , watch this brilliant movie i definitely add my collection	1
seven samurai greatest film made perhaps world greatest film director . string films rashomon red beard represents almost unbroken run classic films ( all but one starring toshiro mifune ) , not least fact akira kurosawa able infuse humanism populism amongst chaos indifference wide variety settings . individuals could make difference indifferent society ( ikiru , red beard ) or work together common cause ( seven , sanjuro ) , while other films inhumanity class culture ( lower depths , stray dog , high low ) laid bare . yet other times , it could seen kurosawa soured idea society could change better films like bad sleep well record living , giving way chaos fortress blood yojimbo . but whether pessimistic or optimistic , kurosawa films seldom fail both entertain inform . seven samurai principle strength it manages both extraordinarily high level . film this length ( three hours 27 minutes ) there almost no wasted footage ; nothing here simply there pretty fill-in slow patch . everything purpose ; there nothing mysterious motivations bandits , conflicting attitudes villagers , quiet charisma kambei ( takashi shimura ) which binds samurai cause which there little gained besides meal possibly death . beginning there logical progression human action relation problem . viewer feeling film completeness other epic films strive but fail achieve . although times it may seem otherwise viewer weaned non-stop violence or cheap emotion , seven never dull polemic . humor abounds , conflicts villagers and/or samurai often accentuated elicit maximum ( but never melodramatic ) emotional effect . even during periods quiet contemplation , kurosawa won't let incongruities human existence escape unnocticed : kyuzo sits under tree reflecting flower he picked , instant later he rises kill two bandits just serenely . when they come , battle sequences given over realism , not style ; watching attack bandits ' hideout , we amazed unlike stylized wire-fu current films , we see men who don't time pose simply hacking away before they get hacked . final battle sequence , kurosawa turns up authenticity fever pitch . we become so involved fighting ourselves time na�ve , innocent katsushiro overcome bloodlust we too disappointed all bad guys already dead . unlike original criterion release , film split two discs rather than one , apparently accommodate slightly improved video transfer two additional audio tracks , one new 5.1 dolby surround sound , other new commentary track . michael jeck audio commentary holdover first release , me it preferable since like film it lean point -- doesn't drown out film track , so one enjoy film benefit jeck explaining cultural idiosyncrasies film technique . new commentary track split half-dozen film critics , one taking over particular section film other . this gimmick times disconcerting , while it may some interest hear variety opinions , fact they don't compete one means we don't learn anything much new . one might expect three-disc set there few supplements ( whether they worth $49.99 price tag may matter conjecture ) . most interesting me these " my life cinema " which kurosawa discusses evolution his art . outset interviewer tells him his tall stature not " typical " japanese ; discussion goes , apparently neither conformist japanese stereotype apply him . despite his reputation set , here we see often bemused , modest self-deprecating individual ; " foreigners treat us ( japanese filmmakers ) like vips ; japan we're treated like tramps " he jokes one point . two additional documentaries serviceable overview film ( " it wonderful create " series ) samurai film genre , " seven samurai : origins influences . " there also small booklet which contains few brief comments variety individuals , one greater interest provided mifune , who like some other great actors our time didn't take himself or his profession too seriously . we certainly get sense mifune proud part seven samurai , but fun doing it , matter . if film ever deserved special edition treatment , it seven samurai . i would preferred more thorough penetrating making-of documentary film this caliber , i suspect price may scare away all but most devoted film aficionados . still , if you it , you it .	1
after watching this movie one friday night i immediately watched it again . " i just see " my initial reaction . fantastic film sticks you weeks . initially rented local blockbuster before purchasing it via amazon , i watched it over 6 times before returning it back . i loved cat stevens soundtrack it makes me sad there no harold maude soundtrack all songs especially " tea tillerman " . you appreciate brilliant directing although it considered " creepy " it never truly unsettling , but rather it makes you examine how you add value life myself created ways maude-a-licous !	1

all hateful self-centered characters idiotic plot lines this movie , one i found most offensive one involving emilio estevez/andie macdowell . isn't stalking hilarious ? isn't kirby cutest obsessed stalker you've ever seen ? i bet stalking victims everywhere wish their stalker lovable little kirby . i also loved end when ally sheedy tells andrew mccarthy judd nelson she just wants them " all friends " . which they both reply classic cinema line , " ehhhh ... ok . " wow . now that drama .	-1
i thought this one best mighty morphin power rangers episodesin this series , original green ranger tommy recruited evil rita repulsa .. power rangers forced fight one ther own kind . they call up upon their megazord stop rampage city brought forth goldar , ritas most powerful warrior , evil stinging scorpina who called upon 10,000 later , ritas newest baddest adviorsary rangers quot ; green rangerquot ; .. three fight megazord while rita starts eclips cut megazords power source out . out theie megazord power rangers renderd completly helpless , later command center they find out green rangers identity , watch this your self see what i mean	1
two my best friends living their last days when philadelphia made . one them went dr. whose office used opening scenes , receiving experimental drug precursor today more successful cocktails . i watched them struggle time when reagan wouldn't even say word aids public . bush wasn't much better . so film come out tried its best tackle most tragic disease our lifetime , one touched me personally , well , i am willing forgive couple shortcomings . it monumental film anyone struggling aids , those who helped support them , giving us all one first voices permeated psyche our country , beyond boundaries ny sf . now i just learned good 14 years after fact , one those best friends , tim pettifer , among guys waiting room " one foot banana peel other grave " which included here . his characteristic modesty , he never mentioned it might produced , it released after he died . i'm going buy it course , am filled nervous anticipation ( dread ) thought seeing him come back " life " . i've never stopped grieving this loss . my point work effort went into this film went far beyond hollywood acting such . it spoke truth , time , not talked intelligently , if all . one tim caregivers , i know fact there so much philadelphia spot . film bears witness excrutiating moment time , when most our nation total denial . sadly , not much changed	1

whenever people hear sofia coppola they think 2 things : her much-maligned performance godfather iii , her famous dad francis ford coppola , director godfather films apocalpyse now . latter particular fodder nepotism remarks , although it not if her dad made some stellar movies lately . " jack " anyone ? well this film her next film lost translation should tip scale her favor she quite perfect this kind material . 5 lisbon sisters live extremely sheltered lives thanks their over-protective parents , particular their mother . after one them commits suicide , boy starts liking one them prompting bring some friends meet rest . infatuation develops pretty soon they start getting into something when it over , they still don't know how make sense it . one things sometimes happen film like this order explain story , certain characters moments dropped or just never filmed . while i'm certainly not faulting film , we're never really invested enough into each girl who they . fact i couldn't actually name them until someone film actually . it not big knock but it one thing i noticed . performance-wise it pretty solid across board , including kirsten dunst agains t-t ype role james woods . usually very manic , he quite sedate here which quite perfect dad . there also almost unrecognizable kathleen turner very strict mother even quick scene danny devito giovanni ribisi narrator . dvd definately needs special edition even though what else could there add besides making-of , deleted scenes commentary ? than again lost translation seemed kinda sparse . commentary this disc anyone would've great , even francis would've great one kind critique/overview his daughter first film . i mean this guy godfather , surely he could've given professional review this ? it hard say which film better but this film quite good one regardless proof one really bad performance doesn't make everything else terrible	1
supercomputer takes over world , eh ? sounds like rather unbelievable plot , except this movie they make it believable . , if you believe they'd make computer first place controls all nuclear bombs u.s. , which i very hard time believing most people who make war machines would install some kind manual safety . this movie starts out optimistic which makes it bit dull start , but halfway through it becomes very intense . ending very chilling , makes me wish there couple hours . i give it 4 stars because it bit slow predictable start , but it builds builds until end scares pants right you	1
i love this little story relationship two sisters . performances heartfelt score haunting . it still gets me :	1
oscar winning documentary studies career robert strange mcnamara , savior ford motor company , architect viet nam war , patron saint golbalization economy , self-justifier par excellence , ( imho ) one greatest villains 20th century . ( ok , hes not level stalin or hitler or walter o'malley , but hes close ) . film manages remain even handed its subject , something i would never able , level it should appreciated . i think his fans come away seeing him tragically flawed hero , his detractors ( like me ) come away seeing him vile [ ... ] he . movie demands you think , alone it should seen any person interested americas role world .	1
most likely this review not very helpful anyone , but i wanted comment how beautifully this film . i am long time u2 fan seen rattle hum , but didn't get around purchasing dvd until late 2005 . fact music wonderful given , but cinematography just astounding . i love how you get see everything every point view . you get see what band sees around stage , including breathtaking sea fans . you get see what fans see -- spectacular lighting silhouettes . you get hear what guys think feel off-stage well . course you get passionate music . film beautiful watch it listen . i couldn't ask more	1
this not type movie you watch while distracted or doing something else . i went show see this movie not get it all , so i rented it see what i missing . show , it just seemed like lot shooting , guy trying deal his dramatic girlfriend , trigger happy brother , family man who fighting bad guy lifestyle , very confused brother who doesn't know whether he wants rockstar or gangster . four meet find out who killed their brother although other three realize this may heavier than they thought , there always one testosterone heavy guy who think he superman . mr. testosterone ringleader many fights , shoot-outs , all four unite justice . this movie proof how brother bond , regardless race , when loyalty comes into play . i'm definitely glad i gave it second chance . side note : soundtrack music point . classic music artists like temptations marvin gaye play background , which makes this modern day western even cooler . i wish scene angel character bathtub could've shown deleted scenes so i could see whether it looked believable , but i cracked up " bobby teases jack " scene . i wish would've left movie make bobby character more human ( hilarious ) . my only problem this movie mark wahlberg saying n-word . i don't care how much or how long his character supposed streets : there still certain barriers not crossed . other than , great movie	1
this actually very enjoyable film , kenneth mars turning very funny performance . donny marie osmond such wonderful musical talents , i only wish film incorporated more them singing . it lot like old elvis movies . it just fun watch ! i only wish this would released dvd ...	1
throne blood masterpiece one world greatest film makers height his powers . only kurosawa could take essence shakespearian stage drama incorporate it into medium film dynamic tour de force . yet same time he remains faithful elements noh ( stagy traditional japanese play-form which design movement minimalized ) . seeming contradiction , dynamism static-ness yet kurosawa masters both same medium . usual ; acting , writing , cinematography , sound , direction production all pitch perfect . this second shakespearian based film kurosawa , focus interplay fate , free fine thread human psyche uses weave two together . more simpler level it man living dying sword . short what goes around comes around . what comes around toshiro mifune he gets his just deserts scene straight arrow , perfect direction kurosawa leading quite pointed culminatin events ( pun intended ... see movie you'll understand ) . bonus features include excellent linear notes well superb commentary donald richie . few people more knowledgeable film japanese film then he . commentary almost interesting movie itself . usual criterion presents its film pristine condition . some may complain criterion too pricey but them you get best cinema offer . you cannot go wrong . one kurosawa masterpiece packs more poignancy , punch philosophy then 10 lesser films thus you get 10 times movie 5 times price , really quite deal if you look it way .	1
not exactly concert video , but not really documentary either . few concert videos i've seen ( including u2 " elevation " ) single edited concert , largely limited handful cameras angles . contrast , " rattle hum " shows series different concerts around us during their joshua tree tour incredible camera angles put you right stage . but it goes bit beyond shows some rehersals recording sessions some new songs , some backstage shots , few brief interviews , but not point where you would really call it " documentary . " edge really puts it best when he says ( film ) , " it music . " most film black white , which comes across very cool . exception color footage sun devil stadium , sudden contrast more than half-way through adds " coolness " factor . there quite few notable songs dvd such " exit , " " bad , " emotional " sunday bloody sunday " bw ; " or without you , " " running stand still , " " bullet blue sky " color ( just name few ! ) . also excellent parts bb king " when love comes town " gospel choir harlem " still haven't found what i'm looking . " my opinion , most versions dvd better than recorded versions or what included cd . ahhh , who am i kidding ... i think whole thing cool	1
highly recommended example how stage sequence complex scene . if you like black comedy , you should enjoy " confessions american girl " . rena ( jena malone ) embodiment old cartoon where guy sitting ground noose around his neck broken rope his hand ; captioned " some people can't anything right " . rena lives mobile home her somewhat " strange " family , suicide challenged , pregnant guy who doesn't want seen public her , blames it all unfair eight year absence her loving father , who prison murder . her dim idealic memories her father somewhat biased . highway its exit ramps metaphors her life her desire end her life . film not quite good " ghost world " but much same tone feel . alicia witt plays rena half-sister . because malone witt arguably most intelligent actresses hollywood , you immediately wonder wisdom casting them moronic trailer trash . but malone special talent playing this kind " slack-jawed " character witt standard sarcastic teen character works fine even this environment . their scenes together best ones film ; their reconciliation scene toward end especially good . brad renfro good job rena brother , o-lon jones ( remember waitress seinfeld " bubble boy " episode ) excellent small role clifton collins jr. great buddy , prison trustee , who quickly sizes up situation sets forces change motion . while " american girl " above average film , its main scene ( picnic prison which actually takes up majority film ) pushes it into cinema classic territory . this scene example way storytelling should , pacing absolutely inspired . it staged perfectly buddy orchestrates sequence revelations changes all four visiting family members . even if you hate subject this film it worth watching just see how wonderfully they manage this climatic scene . disasterous visit over , family leaves prison statement " it went better than it could " . then again , what i know ? i'm only child .	1
one best reasons , any rate . one hour pure uncut slapstick insanity directed mgm gonzo animator , tex avery . must any animation fan	1
i love this movie it gained somewhat cult standing amongst several my friends since we first saw it two years ago . story definitely interesting ( random people awake find themselves trapped endless series cubes , some which equipped lethal traps ) primarily what holds up movie because script acting only mediocre . because they such weak elements , script acting become comical if you try not take them too seriously . i think this best way watch this film , otherwise you may come away it thinking it purely awful . instance some dialouge includes lines like " you all sniffing glue all your lives ? " " i see inside people like f*ckin ' ray !. " funny , right ? not kind dialouge you take seriously believe . however , story very cool movie offer some frightening moments , but overall i would recommend this film comedy . maybe that just my twisted sense humo	1
no matter how preposterous or cliche film bare premise may sound , if larry cohen name attached it , you certain it interesting entertaining piece cinema . cohen scripts films always filled lots wild imagery ( both literal figurative ) , often complex themes , lots sophisticated satirical subtext . his 1982 opus : winged serpent no exception , despite whatever goofy-sounding title may seem imply . usual , writer/director cohen tongue-in-cheek film sidesteps usual horror cliches instead delivers fairly tight story , interesting characters , clever dialog , ton subtle yet witty social metaphor . yes , there also little nudity gore . titular quetzalcoatl , flying serpentine god ancient aztecs who summoned modern-day manhattan via bizarre sacrificial rituals performed contemporary aztec priest . since its arrival big apple borough , humongous beastie swooping down unsuspecting pedestrians , swimmers , sunbathers chowing down , but police initially skeptical eye-witness reports giant flying reptile but loss any other explanation . enter street thug opportunist jimmy quinn ( michael moriarty ) . inadvertently stumbled across q nest , quinn willing give information cops -- price . special fx : winged serpent , especially stop-motion animation serpent itself , admittedly cheesy . but fx aren't really point far cohen concerned ; they're just window dressing . instead , his usual satiric flair , cohen uses film take some playful pokes modern western lifestyle . example , : winged serpent draws several sardonic parallels ancient pagan religions modern christianity . notes one cop after learning details aztec sacrificial ritual : quot ; victim heart ritually removed presented god . luckily , all we today eat wafer drink wine -- ? civilized . quot ; several shots chrysler building , cohen makes deliberate visual comparisons modern architecture ancient aztec temples . acting film pretty good overall , cohen manages coax especially outstanding performance actor michael moriarty . role opposite conservative types he usually plays , moriarty hilarious yet believable sympathetic dim-witted , hapless hood who hopes sell his knowledge q whereabouts city authorities cool $ 1,000,000 . david carradine ( kung fu fame ) pretty good turn city detective charge case , richard roundtree -- cinema tv original shaft -- delightful carradine partner . cute candy clark , nominated oscar her performance 1973 american graffiti , also great job minor role moriarty live-in girlfriend . blue underground dvd release : winged serpent must-have cohen fans . it offers nearly pristine digital transfer film its original aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 ( 16x9 enhanced ) , audio options include original mono , excellent stereo remix , dolby 5.1 track , dts 6.1 track . bonus features include informative entertaining running commentary cohen his protege bill lustig , well teaser trailer , photo gallery , some dvd-rom-only goodies . short , : winged serpent may not cohen best flick , but it pretty good one won't disappoint fans writer/director or fans b-movie horror . blue underground dvd well worth price admission	1

successful describing what cuba all , this film also life . it made me think , not only this writer case , but great writings or other creative works made prison . there something prison force us grasp nature life . or perhaps it also said nothing kill truly liberal mind . movie , english spoken among cubans cuba , whereas suddenly they start speaking spanish without translation . i find it very annoying . it makes perfect sense if they spoke spanish cuban prison start speaking english after he left cuba . i live miami am surrounded thousands cubans , so i know cubans cuba not typically speak english conversations among themselves . i don't mind subtitles while scene cuba , i wish what what they . unfortunately this language mix-up reason why i cannot give 5 stars .	1
heroic tale individualistic morality no identifiable political overtones many suggest but philosophical one confronting threat wrong doing proper action . movie not romantic theme one against many nor moral crusade but clearly stresses impact one few or many . when put into difficult choices imperative ones conscience needs only moral guide ruling passion plays leading role this movie . fact marshall kane confronts murderer resolve keeping peace harmony town doubled later his quaker wife acting against her pacifistic philosophy thwarting murderous outlaw miller case point clear situation confronting evil individual matter despite common folk wisdom day shared apathetic town who remain isolationist despite clear present danger outlaw miller return wreak havoc not only marshall but possible return into anarchy lawlessness once ruled prior kane triumph first time around . movie poses few aspects governing life . 1 . one man make difference overall moral compass ? 2 . why people act fearfully when confronting wrong ? 3 . when it acceptable go against majority opinion society when society wrong ? 4 . need times quick decision making even when odds stacked against you . movie depicts these questions answers forcibly side justice righteousness . indeed this dvd collectors edition classic film , not ordinary western but boasts 2 audio restoration versions , trailers , commentary interviews housed paper ingrained slipcase . heroic tale bravery remains believable .	1

this what science fiction supposed , thought provoking . excellent imagery . superb plot . well developed . wonderful ending .	1
this movie affectionately received title " lysol movie " my house , because it eliminated 99.9% unnecessary garbage movies filled today . swearing low ( less than ten times whole movie , i think what i counted ) there absolutely no inappropriate jokes , clothing , or anything . this definitely breath fresh air ! almost every movie polluted lately , my christian family this movie so welcomed . story line ingenious . far fetched , sure , but so pirates everyone loves . ( i am no way comparing two movies , pirates completely different , but they both storylines based something real exaggerated ) it pretty historically correct ; benjamin franklin really write silence dogood letters , clock tower 100 dollar bill really say 2:22 ! nicholas cage fantastic job portraying ben , riley just hilarious . no matter how many times i've seen this movie , he always cracks me up . this best action movie made lately because everyone watch it . little kids don't leave certain parts ; sure , it not perfect , but that why i call it lysol movie	1
lot people say 1974 version this movie better , filled more action raw feel it . true . but i wasn't growing up then , hence cars , actors scenes not my generation so i like new one . besides above " elenor " car chase scene 40 minutes original only 20-odd minutes this one which good thing because today fickle audience not sit through 40 minutes run-around leave alone anything else . nicolas cage pretty convincing job " memphis " car thief who it thrill because allegedly cars beg stolen not gain or glory . nobel eh ! modern day robin hood . lovely angelina jolie miniscule role this movie -more eye candy than anything else- not actually contribute but she still lovely isn't she ? i told friend i am not " real chase movie watchers " well , thank god what i say . if i led such monotonous life i would surely die . besides that what ps2 - harebrained car chases last longer than 8 10 hours . verdict : overall i think movie struck decent balance remaking classic living moment . good movie watch over over again-ish . rating : 4 stars creditable performance true possible original without loosing any integrity .	1
yes this " worth it " . i took my younger brother three movies our teens , apocalypse now , deer hunter spinal tap . older sis i forget near death face he wore after first two(of course he'll never forget it ) but utter outrage his 14 year old zeppelin playing , doors 24/7-loving self displayed after tap ... ah i recall ever after . ( usually any girlfriend comes around ) . he took it all actual documentary , no mockumentary concept ken , while i laughed myself into aisles jokes i still love ... he incenced .

my watching this film resulted conversation friend beginning politics spiraling down future our world . premise film disturbing say least . i never true fan charleton heston who my opinion always overacted . however , edward . robinson seemed comfortable playing this character he many different roles he played . his performance truly heartfelt , bringing mind current debate " ending one own life dignity " . i shutter think this life it should though . but robinson character acted decision counterfeit courage ultimate hopelessness accompanied it such way you could very well empathize him . i found other actors somewhat bland . perhaps this acting point time , but some actors make most roles others cannot . story line unique , but script lacking . re-make today steven spielberg might worthwhile seeing . perhaps most striking element i took this film unshakeable chilling unsettling feeling this could very well our world if we not wake up	1
i must admitt this movie hard rate . i love evil witch belladonna who appears this movie i like her cousin annabelle(the pink whippet ) says more than 4 lines . thing takes this rating down would plot . who hasn't heard real ' christmas carol ' thousand times already ? it really just like all rest characters adgth . i'm big fan adgth(i webisite it too)but plot gets boring when you've heard it thousand times . i give this movie 5 stars out five characters 2 out five originallity . go which ever matters more	1

i've watched this movie dozens times since i child . i love it . i understand it doesn't follow book exactly , but they making movie , not filming book . actor who played mary wonderful . character colin annoyed me somewhat , but i don't love every character story adore it . i love romance ending , but i very sad dickon died . soundtrack incredible ; i read review where reader said she found herself humming soundtrack even though she hasn't seen movie quite some time . you're not only one ! it haunting say least . only discrepancy i found movie this : if movie flashback mary , then how could she remembered certain scenes , such archibald craven dreaming his wife when he alps , conversation mrs. medlock dickon mother ? never made sense me , even child . i explain myself she simply remembering time period movie simply including all parts story . last thing scared bee-jeebies out me child scene beginning when cat jumps mary . all all , i love this movie watch it dozens more times .	1

me female friend went watched this one theater . i ... ... bored ... out ... ... my ... skull . after half hour my friend , who tends more " progressive " than i , actually suggested we leave . it first time either us ever left while movie playing . ever ! perhaps i'm biased . however i highly recommend no one get this movie . only reason i think anyone would give it good rating because its political slant . i tend lean right , but even i entertained vendetta , despite it blatant liberal propaganda . if you going pontificate how we conservatives evil , least make it interesting	-1
`a mighty wind ' funny , it actually really funny ... it just such disappointment when you come off brilliance `best show ' . so , `a mighty wind ' follows same mockumentary premise ( i just love these type comedies ) it stars same cast except instead eccentric dog owners we ex folk singers . so this famous record producer dies commemorate his life they decide get his three biggest acts reunite perform concert his honor . `best show ' mvp parker posey not highlight this time around , instead it eugene levy who plays mitch like constipated manic depressant . jennifer coolidge , while only like 2 minutes movie , me rolling floor especially when they all humming . great comedy , while not up par it predecessor , still makes quite impression	1

so guy decides eat mcd 30 days straight his health deteriorates - oh duh ! ok , obviously people aren't watching ending , it doesn't matter we all know that gonna happen already ( otherwise titanic would not made ) . reason watch : 1 ) it entertainment . yes , even docs telling him lose weight fat . but best part his calls mcd annoy their people . 2 ) it scary . especially if you grown up poor neighborhood , yes people really eat like . even more scary : those guys drinking 60 gallons cool aid . 3 ) it could you . sure , we all deride those people who go mcd everyday lacking self-discipline , but what kids ? although film doesn't dvelve into literature research , fact remains commercials mcd put out directed youth , very profitable results . not mention our taste wired age , so if kid grew up eating stuff ... well he basically addicted . i highly enjoy this movie . unfortunate thing i'm not sure if this movie change anything long term future , mcd once again revise its commercials seen success yet again ... oh well , i guess we'll all paying consequences future	1

spanish-born actor javier bardem gives staggering performance cuban poet reinaldo arenas , which lucky since he almost every frame this film . fact , he only constant biopic sometimes feels disjointed bit long-winded , piecing together it various episodes arenas ' life sometimes sacrificing narrative flow process . same time , this powerfully moving film displays intensity post-revolution persecution experienced cubans more effectively than either carlos eire memoir , " waiting snow havana " , or hollywood confections such sydney pollack " havana " or richard lester " cuba " . director julian schnabel , artist himself who previously directed film celebrity graffiti artist jean michael basquiat , jumps back forth like abstract painter clarifying time periods employing captions . we first see arenas ' birth 1943 rural cuba followed glimpses his poverty-stricken childhood . story then moves forward 1958 just before castro rose power when arenas becomes revolutionary living eastern cuba . 1964 , both open gay intellectual , arenas ' writings made him anathema castro regime . next fifteen years , he shuttles back forth jail freedom , arenas ' story sheds much light difficult living member not just one but two minorities . highly visual terms , schnabel creates striking tableau life cuba shows how getting out cuba not easy decision natives make , arenas , like most cubans , makes it only begrudgingly first . imagine give up everything fleeing . there vividly filmed sequence all-night party abandoned convent houses homemade hot-air balloon ( shades jules verne ) which one them decides escape selfishly fatally . there also some powerful scenes show humiliating torture arenas experienced prison ending finally his escape ultimately his departure cuba mariel harbor exodus 1980 one castro " undesirables " . arenas then went into exile new york living his former lover , lazaro . sadly , soon after his arrival america , he became ill aids . american sequence short , allowing maximum time cuba ordeal makes up most film . charismatic bardem superb capturing emotional combustion his character life . there few guest appearances somewhat undermine story realism , nearly unrecognizable turn sean penn cuban peasant dual roles , johnny depp sadistic , closeted lieutenant transvestite named bon bon , who entertains prisoners el moro prison . use english versus spanish seems more director discretion than actual circumstances within scenes . but these forgivable indulgences since schnabel made valuable film telling tale cuban struggle hardship type we surprisingly don't see often film . 133 minutes , it seem bit overlong , but arenas packed full life his 47 years . most importantly , schnabel successfully paints picture depicting influences behind arenas ' writing : his difficult childhood , his conflicted feelings his mother , coming terms his sexuality , revolution cuba , pain outcast his own country . one might expect painter , schnabel uses images effectively words advance story . most simple quite beautiful , such early scene rainstorm turns into raging torrent water , later shot countless prison inmates dangling bars soap outside their jail cells , or flashes snow falling new york arenas his friend lie speeding convertible . nevertheless , because arenas , writer , dealt words , it impossible tell his story without embracing this component , bardem economical voiceovers attest aspect dramatically effective manner . strongly recommended spite relatively minor flaws . dvd also includes interesting french television interview real arenas 1983	1
this honestly one best films i've ever seen my entire life . actually it so good , i am compelled write review ....... something i've never before . i first saw this movie home cable . when i started watching it , i really didn't think much it ( almost expected it mediocre actually ) because i hadn't once heard anything good ( or bad ) . i figured movie profound i found out it should least created some sort stir among someone i knew ... i haven't gone through all reviews , so i don't know if this mentioned prior me mentioning it here , but what really struck chord me(and actually what movie teaches you general ) everything happens your life effects you . it affects how you look things future , it affects your confidence , it affects your attitude , etc . okay , maybe this course given but bigger meaning seeing this movie really opens your eyes seeing what always said really true !! especially when you see it front you like . seeing it your face really goes show how individual attitude towards events their live go either one way or . end , life you live go one way or too ;) basically , everything occurs us ... we control how we react therefore how it affects our future . event not control us ; rather we control how event affects us after it occurs . very quantum theory/kabbalahistic/spiritual i would say . i actually plan watching this movie time time ( " what bleep we know ) order keep this important point forefront my mind :)	1
given pornography multi-jillion-dollar-a-year business , it sort surprising it hasn't received cinematic treatment more often , but boogie nights provides it sort skewed , darkly comic treatment it almost certainly deserves , becomes certifiable classic process . following story eddie adams , simple-minded , almost impossibly well-endowed teenager suburban california who achieves porn stardom dirk diggler before turning 20 , boogie nights both time-tested star-is-born-and-almost-blows-it-all story loving tribute time place probably never replicated individuals who made it what it . paul thomas anderson directing excessive stylish you'd expect movie centered porno industry , anderson pulling out every trick book -- long tracking shots , underwater closeups , montages , movie-within-a-movie views , some moments approach stream-of-consciousness ( dirk vision his professional name literally exploding off neon sign prominent example ) . naturally , anderson also loads movie up period details , right down farah fawcett poster teenage dirk room , platform shoes , obligatory disco sequences . its visual flair aside , though , boogie nights also sort insanely quotable , watch-it-until-you've-memorized-it movie seemed come out droves nineties ( trainspotting , fargo , goodfellas , swingers , true romance , etc . etc . etc . ) but disturbingly short supply this decade . this movie simply seems everything you think going it , especially its murderer row cast -- burt reynolds ( jack horner ) , don cheadle ( buck swope ) , john . reilly ( reed rothchild ) , julianne moore ( amber waves ) , william . macy ( little bill ) , luis guzman ( maurice rodriguez ) , tom jane ( todd parker ) , philip baker hall ( floyd gondolli ) , philip seymour hoffman ( scotty jay ) , alfred molina ( rahad jackson ) all figure prominently -- even wahlberg ( dirk himself ) heather graham ( rollergirl ) roles perfectly suited their relative limitations actors . said , what really gives movie its resonance obvious sympathy which it treats its characters , who generally easy laugh but equally easy like . main characters almost entirely hopes , aspirations , attachments beyond rather closed world their profession--jack desire serious filmmaker ; dirk ridiculous pseudo-karate reed equally ridiculous poetry ; buck goal opening his own stereo store ; amber attempts get back touch her son , which she blatantly compensates mothering her co-stars -- helping us see them fleshed-out characters , not just plot devices story . since there isn't really plot speak , movie told series episodes , goodfellas-style , several extended pieces -- pool party jack house where eddie/dirk gets introduced whole crew ; new year eve party celebrating start ' 80's; fake drug deal gone bad rahad house -- serving turn narrative new directions . this last set piece -- when dirk , reed , todd head over rahad house sell him some baking soda disguised cocaine it quickly degenerates into laughably misguided robbery attempt -- deserves special mention , it easily one most fascinating single scenes recent film memory . it starts off almost surreal , skinny chinese guy walking around randomly lighting firecrackers rahad ( clad only underwear , bathrobe slippers ) discoursing semi-coherently he sings not-so-classic 80 songs mixtape . there it just gets progressively darker tenser , lighting , acting , direction all perfectly serving ratchet up feeling desperation horror todd kicks his ill-conceived robbery plot into motion things spin way out control . molina over-the-top performance , more than anything else , makes scene , he turns rahad into manic ball drug-fuelled energy , later , shotgun-toting avenging angel determined take his revenge . i wouldn't say molina turns best performance i've ever seen movie , but it it probably best performance i've seen someone who only got one scene whole movie . ' 80 , course , hangover joys previous decade , emergence video downgrades quality product , cocaine suddenly becomes addictive , dirk starts become too big his britches more ways than one . fittingly , disco era gives way tougher times eighties , movie takes darker turn , becoming grittier , more downcast lot more violent , but no less compelling . all unbridled energy creativity first half still present , just decidedly less sunny form . even when people getting beaten up shot left right , movie pedal-to-the-metal pacing makes it all but impossible look away . well , except maybe notorious money shot end , but then i one didn't care .	1
once upon time there some very interesting movies made . this during 1980s . some directors some interesting ideas showing how high school quirky moments educational sometimes but also give life lessons help down road . even teachers political viewpoints , not just parents . maybe not anymore . after all wouldn't politically correct any more talk class . i feel sorry students today , so many things not allowed i don't know how they learn anything life personality . well back this movie . it jon cryer best all his movies i seen . funny suspenseful some love thrown romantics . cryer stock broker , andrew morenski , finds himself run hitmen . he hides out nephew finds high school student , max hauser , good cover . cryer excellent rest supporting cast great well . any fan movies like quot ; ferris bueller day offquot ; quot ; breakfast clubquot ; probably love it	1

boogie nights one those films , vein blow , fear loathing las vegas , requiem dream , stares unflinchingly something ugly asks us follow without blinking . when it porn industry , it hard not blink . it swinging 70s , porn rise . eddie adams aka dirk diggler ( mark wahlberg ) , fresh-faced lad particular gift . gift happens his pants . his reputation well known , but it only when porn director jack horner ( burt reynolds ) discovers him dirk career takes off . thus begins bizarre journey into seedier side filmmaking , complete diva-level antics , arguments video technology , lots sex drugs . what alternately curious interesting film this traditional rag riches story , only it happens involve porn . dirk portrayed natural talent , trait every character observes deadly seriousness . his talent , dedication his " art , " elevates entire porn industry itself , merely badly filmed shaky-cam sex films dramas plot character development . well , what passes character development porn , anyway . there amber waves ( julianne moore ) , porn queen barred seeing her own children subsequently mother everybody . reed rothschild ( john . reilly ) dirk right-hand man frequent co-star . rollergirl ( heather graham her best acting role yet ) , it her roller skates . all time . buck swope ( don cheadle ) black porn star wants live american dream owning his own business . finally , we little bill ( william . macy ) , assistant director horner married utterly hedonistic woman who it everyone , everywhere , any time . time we get 80s , several characters dead , video king , dirk too hopped up drugs notice it affecting his performance . falling out horner leads dirk strike out his own , trying anything but porn star . unfortunately , dirk only good one thing . it takes him most movie figure out what . horner , waves , dirk creates their own twisted , happy family . incapable living society separately due stigma what they , they form kinship only they share . even they their own bonds boundaries ; their work , themselves , each other . those cannot define who they end up dead or prison , or worse . end , boogie nights making good what you've got . yes means even porn stars sometimes face facts : sometimes you're best talent sex camera . question becomes what 17-year-old kid turned porn star supposed it . boogie nights answers it final scene , when true star film unzipped stare us face	1

okay , script not most imaginative i've ever seen , but i like actors ( especially ben best man ) so i friendly this movie most part . i didn't even mind obvious holes plot , such ... why these characters not credit cards or cell phones ? or least , why don't they use them ? oh no , much more plausible ben strip dance gay bar $150 buy car drive nc . i didn't even mind fact whole " we're married my husband doctor . " charade so predictable . oh gee , he pretending doctor he tour bus bunch elderly people . d'ya think someone might heart attack " dr. holmes " might step up ? uh , they're pretending married oh ! surprise there best man maid honor ! d'ya think they're gonna get busted ? what killed it me ridiculous ending . it obviously supposed surprise ( it ) but there seemed no other reason it than pull fast one audience . i felt cheated . i spent entire movie getting emotionally involved relationship sarah ben , i really cared how they would handle things fiance sarah little boy all . i cheerfully became disengaged relationship ben bridget , i totally believed neither one them ready get married or right each other . film spent inordinate amount time showing me they're not right each other this wedding not meant happen . right up last moment , we think he breaking it off bridget . instead , what heck let just go ahead get married after all . huh ? he left sarah sitting out there waiting him hurricane !!! after making her promise she would still there when he got back . this man obviously doesn't clue what he wants life , i'm expected believe they lived happily ever after ? not only , but what it teach us taking this commitment seriously ? it teaches us if our instinct telling us " don't it ! " our genitals yearning someone else even mother nature seems working hard prevent this marriage , aw heck go ahead it anyway . it just marriage . it romantic ! you could get lucky live happily ever after!it my experience , when things aren't feeling just right you approach wedding , turn run . last thing you should close your eyes , grab your balls take leap	-1

many vietnam war movies date depicted american soldier vietnam either sadistic murderer , worse , or , best , ignorant robotic slave industrial-military complex . this film early war battle ia drang depicts american soldier simply ordinary person who family who just trying survive while surrounded north vietnamese infantry force four times larger . unlike previous films , you not see gis shooting civilians sport , raping vietnamese girls , cussing like sailors , fooling around prostitutes or just getting drunk . what you see well-trained americans fighting insurmountable odds while looking out their brothers arms . compared more pessimistic movies like " platoon " " full metal jacket " , " we soldiers " may come across right-wing patriotic propaganda . however , this movie ultimate aim show what actually occurred combat field soldier viewpoint rather than preach public pacifist political message vietnam war or war general . one my few complaints 1 ) level north vietnamese casualties appeared exaggerated while americans appeared minimized , despite 4 1 casuality ratio actually occurred during november 1965 battle , 2 ) climatic , but fictional , bayonet charge end reminded me too much real bad patriotic war film also starring mel gibson	1
i loved this movie . breathtaking scenery , simple yet enthralling story , wonderful acting all around . no drugs , no guns , no over-the-top violence . nice movie watch rainy day ....	1
one man life full ups downs pictured film , " throne blood " , directed akira kurosawa . this film japanese re-make version famous shakespearean play , macbeth . because this film japanese film , many details differ macbeth , although basic plot story same . all plot changes , character setting differences effective choices this film because it adds different taste original form story . most plot changes film due cultural differences make plot this film natural flowing , little twist end . some detailed plot adaptations director make included washizu ( playing role macbeth ) taking over cob-web castle , miki ( playing role lady macbeth ) pregnant washizu killed his own men towards end story . medieval japan , man taking over castle not necessarily mean he emperor japan , unlike macbeth aiming king start . therefore , washizu not kill emperor , but he kill others competing castle . however , conflicts washizu other competent similar macbeth because goal they both mind achieve power . this film , miki pregnancy not seem dramatical change plot story , but thought necessary this japanese film . reason this because couple wanted their own child inherit his throne after his death . this inheriting system similar one macbeth , but this director decided add this detail reveal great desires washizu . after all killing struggles take over castle , washizu not want any other person but his child who shares his blood inherit throne . climax this film comes when hundreds soldiers washizu side points their arrows him one one hits him . this plot adaptations made this film because soldiers wanted show sign surrender . giving washizu head represented surrender . this change made film more violent thus added twist unexpected ending . making changes , it very important plot flows it natural . this sort change needed because there no fun film or story completely same original form . main character , washizu very different characteristic macbeth . washizu brave , confident , demanding more selfish than shakespearean macbeth . shogun ( similar position thane when referring macbeth ) strong , determined brave take over castle . unlike macbeth , he demanding his wife tone his speech overall strong . director probably wanted express image brave man going through one straight road towards his goal , but ending tragic death . this maybe typical image shogun during medieval japan . one thing not expressed because this characterization washizu , gradual change washizu beginning end story . this important change express because macbeth , he growing become more aggressive greedy he overcomes obstacles become king . similarly , miki characterization different form lady macbeth too . lady macbeth pretty strong woman , telling her husband what . however , miki not like her because she under circumstance where she cannot , since washizu demanding person . but overall , two characters played japanese actors very well suited this version macbeth . " throne blood " set medieval japan , when shoguns each castle fought prove strongest castle warlords . this setting very suited fit story like macbeth into . both setting lords , emperor/king , warriors . this made it possible details expressed film . example one detail one three apparitions old lady , gave washizu . when old lady told him he victorious unless wood nears neighbor comes down washizu castle . since medieval castle japan constructed top fort used forests woods one protection security methods , this apparition realistic . director chose japan setting this film , probably because many things matched original setting . technically , it completely different setting but it good enough reproduce similar story which very impressive . if people who never seen or heard macbeth happens see " throne blood " not think this film reproductive shakespearean play . this how almost perfectly macbeth throne blood matches . changes made rather improve film . washizu macbeth , both who lived fast tragic life possess lifestyle people today still learn achieve . power films stories . " throne blood " always classical perfect example successful reproductive film .	1

federico fellini 1972 film not his best , when he 8 1/2 , la strada la dolce vita his credit . while many critics adore this film its absurdity plotless , dreamy structure , i found it boring phantasmagorical . it simply fellini version rome not rome , eternal city itself . risk sounding negative , i shall admit there some moments which it most expressive early 1970 rome - scenes which hippies american tourists invade city , long scene outdoor restaurant where everyone talking their heads off ( though saying some pretty vulgar things ) my favorite scene- underground archaelogical excavation which frescoes old roman patricians fade into oblivion . but mostly this film weak it bored me because there no plot . it starts off alright , movie works well when there no sudden fantasy sequences . fellini himself this movie , well gore vidal . fellini envisions himself young man studying rome his youth strict catholic school ( slide/projector shows ancient monuments like colliseum , apian way , trevi fountain vatican well offensive pornographic image woman behind ) later young man journeys rome itself takes residence large family crowded apartment slum . then young man sees talent show tasteless , vulgar long-winded . i found myself just unimpressed outraged audicences went far throw dead cat stage ! it bothered me there much attention prostitution , brothels or cheap , slutty women . cover film promiscuous woman start film . film rome italy , there hardly any allusion opera or any true classical theater . pope fashion show ludicrous blasphemous . only serious , hardcore fans fellini want own this dvd . it perfect follow-up his equally absurd sexually radical satyricon , loosely based old roman epic .	1

before i review , i'd like clear something up : i am very latecomer seeing this movie . i introduced ghost shell franchise through new anime series airing adult swim , ghost shell : standalone complex . i absolutely love show , so i figured eventually i'd get around seeing movie , which i knew full well shares no connection show . they're both seperate interperetations comic series same name , ( which i not read , so i don't know which more accurate ) but tv series exponentially better than this movie almost every concievable way . there many things i don't like this movie , biggest poor pacing . plot movie actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all filler , but that biggest problem . there not really enough story last full-length feature , because it seems almost like it originally written intention 30 minute short . since they didn't budget load movie up action scenes ( there barely any , they aren't very impressive most part ) they slow story down drawn out conversations you won't understand more than 60% , camera shots last what feels like minutes where we're looking either nothing , or woman nipples . that not cinematic artistry , that either lazy or perverted . animation itself isn't even good , especially considering this theatrical release only 10 years ago . it choppy , there not really whole lot detail ( except when it comes women nipples ) . looking just animation , if i didn't know better , i'd thought this movie ova 1980 . only thing i really say i liked this movie it ghost shell . it probably kind like how i didn't see 1989 batman movie until years after i'd spoiled batman animated series , couldn't bring myself like it any reason other than it batman . everything tv series superior this movie : animation , stories , character developement , production values ... i could go entire page how much better tv series . short , if you're you're all interested gits franchise , yourself favor rent dvds tv show instead . you'll find lot love , but i can't say same movie . my dream someday alex proyas give us gits movie lives up what i would hope after watching standalone complex	-1
one classic disney movies i remembered alice adventures wonderland lewis carroll . reading this novel gave me same feelings i my childhood years watching movie . i could wrong but it seems me everything book exactly like movie . alice reading her sister book fell asleep under tree . then she woke up , saw rabbit clothes clock talking . she then followed rabbit into this hole . after she never ending tunnel , which lead her strange world . alice encounters many obstacles story showed how she dealt them . i thought book just like movie . i guess i reading novel made me better understanding . i mainly looking any symbolism some sort , but failed so . i also shocked what things characters doing book made it into disney movie . example caterpillar smoking hookah . i didn't know what hookah until last year . i really confused some parts novel . this book i thought great someone hasn't even heard alice wonderland . it very thin book but it like reading children book . i thought novel would different story than movie . scale 1 - 10 i would give it 7 . just because it interesting reminded me past .	1
if i could make one change this movie , it would near end when angel ( isaac hayes ) tells what happened each characters ... i would added brief cameo muriel ( played brilliantly rosie perez ) getting her just desserts ... i would show muriel , working nail salon , bitter look her face , slamming things around , rude customer barking orders her . other than , great movie !	1

paul newman response jack warden , warden massages mr. newman back tries assuage him telling him there other cases .

( sure director lot input too)- but just watch him . what you witnessing star action . i write this ( june 29 , 2006 ) paul newman 81 years old . he may little slower , little more wrinkled , but his acting just gets better age . ( watch empire falls ) . i truly hope he makes more movies . who knows , perhaps one day i run into him trader joe or mario place . true jackie gleason form , say him , " hubba , hubba , hubba . " , my friends , no act .	1

rashomon ( 1950 ; directed akira kurosawa starring toshiro mifune ) one those films truly hip seen , not many others ; rather like certain books -- road , satanic verses , one hundred years solitude , naked lunch -- it certain hip cache , one cineastes all seen discuss great detail . name-droppers know they need only mention name knowledgeable context viewed awe . truth , however , rashomon sort film everyone should see ; it true classic , league casablanca , citizen kane others . film examines truth , context rape murder 12th century japan , four different perspectives ; woodcutter who witnessed whole incident yet afraid report it , bandit who committed crime , murdered man ghost ( through medium ) rape victim ( murdered man wife ) . there few elements which remain constant each version story -- murdered man tied up forced watch bandit ravish his wife , he indeed die -- but how he died varies . it either swordfight bandit , his wife hand dagger , or suicide resulting his absolutely crushed his wife choosing leave bandit . she demand his death ? he look her scorn after crime ? she really raped or she yield consensually bandit ? honesty also explored detail , wife honesty most question , but also three men sheltering rainstorm ruined gate rashomon who relate story themselves . this one late toshiro mifune ( 1920-1997 ) first collaborations akira kurosawa , his criminally-insane tajomaru masterfully acted . so effective mifune acting you truly loathe tajomaru ; you're torn pity disgust wife ( masahiko kyo , also brilliant actress ) , there truly few really sympathetic characters among cast here . camera work exemplary , shows what kurosawa best known -- unusual perspectives some truly arresting shots , proving his eye detail sharp black white it would later colour ( cf . dersu uzala , kagemusha , ran , 3 latter-day kurosawa masterpieces ) . absolutely worth seeing , proof saying there three sides every story ( wit : mine , yours , what really happened) -- but also proving what really happened isn't even ever certain	1

while i watching this movie i thought myself , " am i going die ? i gone horrible movie hell ? " you see i trapped theater . it like tortured some horrible nightmare but you can't leave cause actors pretending they act just because they're fat . crowd gives you feeling like when it grossly bright outside it sunday afternoon you're car you've sitting 6 hours you feel sweaty there'a football game playing am radio you want escape . conclusion , this movie turns me into melting snow . but i suppose there worse movies -- ( see my review gummo )	-1

premise : lisa reisert ( rachel mcadams ) travelling home last flight night ( red eye ) miami where she lives works hotel manager prestigeous hotel after attending funeral her late grandmother . jackson rippner ( cillian murphy ) mysterious charming stranger she meets airport who it turns out not so coincidentally taking same flight she . rippner reason travel strictly business . it so happens assassination planned secretary homeland security while he stays lisa hotel . rippner needs lisa call hotel arrange secretary stay different room . if she doesn't comply , he man waiting outside her fathers home kill him . thoughts : this one my few experiences wes craven ( director ) work who most known horrible genre teenage slasher films i despise . i dismissed this film theatres without giving second thought , when i finally saw it last night i knew next nothing what it . what i vaguely remembered previews , given craven reputation , i honestly expecting rippner supernatural character such vampire . hindsite , i think ' vampire plane ' woulda much better foundation film . call this film premise shaky kind it unfair . it unfair because core plot points could prove interesting thriller . problem this film how it executes those points . hotel manager ? secretary homeland security ? give me break ! make it deputy director fbi president united states we plotline warrants all this hullabaloo . concept this film potential , but how it staged just too ridiculous . we really believe secretary homeland security important such elaborate scheme assassinate him would put place . we really believe only way this assassination ( which involves missles i tell you ? i won't say anymore ) pulled off if manager hotel get secretary stay different room ? who these nameless caucaisions who want secretary killed ? why ? premise isn't only shaky , it totally gutless . it sickens me hollywood so afraid offending anyone neither antagonist nor their motives any way reflect real world people , situations or beliefs . it forces me recall debacle last adaptation great jack ryan thrillers tom clancy , sum all fears . film , instead militant muslim terrorists acquire nuclear warhead lost isreal ( which truly something fear ) , they decided go nazi . heaven forbid we offend all militant muslim terrorists world portraying them evil stain humankind they . i digress . my point simply red eye doesn't even go far . it no voice . it doesn't tell us anything , worse , it too spineless put face fear . there some good things film . first foremost cast . while rachel mcadams completely not believable manager prestigious miami hotel , part her character more sidenote it fault casting more than her acting anyway . cillian murphy very talented , he look allows him come off charming one moment creepy next . i still wish he woulda turned out vampire though . finally we legendary brian " better than anthony hopkins hannible lector " cox . he such great actor , but this film he relegated most menial roles . almost every scene he him answering phone , woken up phone , or picking up morning paper . film ok it first two acts , second act strongest part film where rachel cillian performances confined mostly their seats plane . it here tension builds , performances really hold scenes . then comes third act film just breaks down complete ludicrousness . story continues off plane gives up completely intellectual thriller . instead it goes action route follows just every cliche movie this type . verdict : red eye interesting idea could beened turned into something lot better under more able screenwriter director . actors performances best they keep this ship afloat . if you ignore ridiculous parts this film which far fetched your typical network tv thrillers , then you may find some enjoyment your first time through . it not horrible , but neither it really good	-1

i always find it irritating read analyses military movies obvious civilians who know nothing military , combat specifically marine corps . this one best movies john wayne made one , least , which he should won oscar . stryker character , played wayne , not " martinet " . he plays marine sergeant , combat veteran , way marine sergeant supposed . tough , but fair . he pushes his people , boots ( recruits ) , because he wants help them survive when they hit beach . if they don't survive they no good him no good mission . wayne excellent job portraying tha t.t he surviving flag raisers who movie marines gagnon hayes , navy corpsman bradley ( whose son wrote flags our fathers ) , not , one previewer noted , " three marines " . navy corpsmen proud navy corpsmen respected such marines whom they serve . also , characters not " soldiers " it really irritating when term used describe marines . men this story marines actors play marines , title earned . short , even though actual combat footage spliced into movie action , given time it made , it well . there some romantic lulls , but given period movie made , 40s 50s , this fairly typical . overali , this great movie , even if you civilian . it give fans duke something memorable watch . it may also give critics john wayne new view man solid actor	1

high noon ( 1952 ) one best western films ever made , but some critics see it parable events hollywood time , especially cold war , persecution un-american screenwriters ( retrospect justified ) , attitudes pacifism , etc . this may case , but really it story man who too proud run . it taut , tightly-scripted , minimalist film sharply focused tale solitary , stoic , honor-bound marshal/hero , past his prime already retired , who left desolate abandoned townspeople he faithfully protected many years . due townspeople cowardice , physical inability , self-interest , expediency , indecisiveness , he refused help every turn against revenge-seeking killer his gang . fearful but duty-bound , he eventually vanquishes enemy , thereby sparing town outlaws . embittered film end , he tosses his tin star into dirt if say town , " there , i saved you , but you didn't deserve it . " gary cooper epitome noble , courageous , self-sacrificing white man who carved america out wilderness . this way movie works much better parable way present day america ( townspeople ) turns its back its heroic white traditions ( gary cooper ) .	1

disney made its mark major studio 1937 its first full-length feature film , snow white seven dwarves . ironically , given this early success , snow white their only hit movie next 13 years . world war ii kicked hell out disney overseas markets . even movies today regarded classic disney - pinnochio , bambi , fantasia - lost money initial release . disney eked through diversifying into training films us government , south american films part fdr good neighbor policy , etc . - stuff made back its costs but not much more . 1948 , disney dire financial straits . they just enough money one more movie . walt disney realized he needed hit or his studio probably wouldn't survive , it would what they best : full-length animated feature film . walt said himself , " what we need movie girl trouble . audiences love . they loved snow white . " that what he wanted : movie like snow white , but even more so - more comedy , more drama , more magic , more music , more lovable characters . he chose basis his company hail mary pass arguably most famous fairy tale world : cinderella . disney didn't money , they earlier films , lavishly storyboard every scene . thus they hit upon wonderfully clever idea shooting entire movie live action , then animators used stills storyboards . photos used survive this day , many provided special edition " extra . " some cases these photos animator drawings over them , turning instance almost bare stage into hall cinderella family chateau . 1950 , cinderella released everything disney so desperately needed . even today , cinderella arguably best movie disney ever made . it just awfully hard argue any aspect this film . animation artwork product disney famous " nine old men " - time not yet old . cinderella pulls off , superbly , something not particularly easy : it integrates believable human characters funny cartoon animals makes it work . eric larson marc davis ' beautiful graceful cinderella ward kimball wonderful jaq gus-gus mice over-the-top lucifer cat , everything flows together so well it all seems perfectly natural . part walt disney plan out-snow white snow white cinderella involved its music . he very consciously wanted cinderella source hit songs . there hit songs disney films before ( " heigh ho " " whistle while you work " snow white , " when you wish upon star " pinnochio , etc . ) but they'd almost accidental . " oh , we hit song , well that nice . " cinderella , disney first time went tin pan alley ( 28th street new york city where professional songwriters could found ) . disney wanted his girl music very best craftsmen , guys who wrote hit songs living . cinderella soundtrack hit big ( #1 album 3/4 million units sold ) songs even today considered quintessential disney , most notably " dream wish your heart makes " movie opening scene , " work song " while animals help cinderella clean house simultaneously build her ball gown , " bibbidi-bobbidi-boo " ( nominated academy award best movie song year ) fairy godmother transformation scene . their best movie , disney apparently spared no expense producing dvd . not only picture quality digitally restored , but audio also cleaned up new 5.1 surround sound mix . totally gone background hiss associated so many old movies . ( cinderella distinction " noisiest movie ever restored " according its audio crew . ) original mono soundtrack also spruced provided option purists . word movie aspect ratio ( i.e. how wide picture compared its height ) . dvd cover says cinderella presented its " original full-screen aspect ratio ( 1.33 : 1 ) " . this untrue . virtually all sound films until 1953 , including cinderella , 1.37 : 1 . since tv screen 1.33 : 1 , you don't lose lot when original " formatted fit your television . " i just wish they hadn't lied it . cinderella ends breakneck pace : we go straight her foot sliding into glass slipper wedding happily ever after , bing , bang , boom . walt disney believed " audiences like happy ending , but they don't like happy ending goes too long . " hey , who am i argue ? well , maybe i'll argue . dvd extra addresses scenes originally planned movie but not actually used . one these would occurred after fitting glass slipper before wedding : cinderella taken grand duke castle her normal everyday clothes ; first time prince charming sees her since ball she not wearing lovely gown , she wearing her scullery maid outfit . cinderella frightened , how he react when he realizes she not fine lady but poor servant girl ? course he doesn't care how she dressed , he loves her anyway . i ** see ** scene my mind , it would worked beautifully . this one way which almost perfect movie could even tiny bit better	1

once upon time there some very interesting movies made . this during 1980s . some directors some interesting ideas showing how high school quirky moments educational sometimes but also give life lessons help down road . even teachers political viewpoints , not just parents . maybe not anymore . after all wouldn't politically correct any more talk class . i feel sorry students today , so many things not allowed i don't know how they learn anything life personality . well back this movie . it jon cryer best all his movies i seen . funny suspenseful some love thrown romantics . cryer stock broker , andrew morenski , finds himself run hitmen . he hides out nephew finds high school student , max hauser , good cover . cryer excellent rest supporting cast great well . any fan movies like quot ; ferris bueller day offquot ; quot ; breakfast clubquot ; probably love it	1

i first saw this movie when it aired tv way back 1987 when i eleven . it still one my ( well my sister few friends ' ) favorite movies . i never read book , not aware they changed plot just bit , until i read other reviewers comments . i never seen any other film versions don't plan it , since this one perfect . story spoiled yet negelected girl named mary who goes live her father old aquaintance england after her folks die flu epidemic india . she first hates her new home because it so huge dark . also it filled sounds moaning , which first she thinks ghost . she finally begins take interest life after meeting her sweet maid martha . martha introduces her her brother dicken they eventually find secret garden . dicken teaches her how love people god creation , she becomes likable . she eventually meets colin , invalid boy who stays his room who also dealt loneliness neglect like mary . they become friends dicken who continues teach them hope . fans colin firth , you thrilled know he plays grown up colin end film . he young hot ! i challenge those you who not seen this film try get through it atleast shedding one tear . it truly touching without overly sappy .	1

movie starts off very slowly , childhood episodes ashton kutcher character . it least 1/2 hour before we see adult kutcher , although he appear very beginning brief scene . premise good , it some good momentum middle , which why i gave it two stars . shifting situations his life lives his friends interesting well , but overall story line very weak , ending dreadful not supported most rest story . also , movie too many tongue-in-cheek references kutcher real life circumstances -- such reference " tighty-whities . " they distract story , make movie more vanity vehicle -- which too bad -- if you not kutcher convert just looking movie , skip this one	-1

logan run belongs class old school science fiction films which popular early mid-1970 , prior beginning star wars franchise . these films not rely non-stop action or dazzling special effects , but rather thoughtful , intelligent stories , intriguing " what if ? " scenarios , astute social commentary . they included sci fi classics such soylent green , omega man , andromeda strain , westworld , others . while shopping mall setting some special effects logan run pretty cheesy , it still interesting film its themes may even more relevant today botox era than they 70 . i heard they doing remake would like think it improve original . unfortunately , given recent history hollywood , it more likely they drain every last bit intelligence out story , replace it more explosions , perhaps smith .	1

15 minutes horrifying gritty peek into injustice american legal system also news media . wow , two digs one film , how you resist ? emil slovak , czech national ( played karel rodan ) , his friend oleg razgul , russian national ( played oleg taktarov ) , who met prague , decide travel america , land opportunity . emil wants hunt down his old crime partner , who took all money robbery he jailed , but oleg infatuated american cinema wants filmmaker . immediately upon arriving , oleg steals video camera store they off confront emil old partner get their money back . but while oleg films event , emil discovers his portion money already spent , he kills his friend friend wife . unfortunately , there someone else watching murder . daphne handlova staying her friends , fled apartment after witnessing murders . illegal alien herself , she not want police or killers find her , but leaves her purse behind apartment where emil discovers who she . apartment burned cover bodies , " bohemian barbeque " says oleg , which calls not only successful homicide detective eddie flemming ( robert de niro ) , but fire marshal jordy warsaw ( edward burns ) scene . emil oleg get away , but while emil obsesses finding daphne , oleg obsesses filming their " trip america " , killings all . he believes he making greatest movie ever . they begin watch new york hot exploitive news show called " top story " , anchored shady newsman/reporter robert hawkins ( played expertly kelsey grammer ) . these three men , flemming , warsaw , hawkins , become irresistible targets emil oleg , two eastern-european psychopaths believing controlling taunting these famous men give them recognition they desire . i don't want give away too much plot , but suffice say there brutal murder scene where flemming showcases just how tough cop he , hawkins reveal himself slimiest snake media industry , emil learn enough know insanity set him free even if he caugh t.t here action beginning end this movie , tight somewhat confusing plot times , some great acting both stars supporting cast ( including great character played david alan grier ) . there seediness wretchedness hopelessness , ending makes film come together quite nicely . if you ready little brutal cop action your life , give 15 minutes try . enjoy !	1
john travolta role vincent vega " pulp fiction " would launch not only major comeback his movie career - but would also start streak money-making well-received movies he would star . one first movies streak would follow-up " pulp fiction " would " get shorty " . " get shorty " , travolta stars chili palmer - collector miami loan-shark who aspires get into movie business . this role seemed tailor-made travolta . it brings solid cast carry out storyline - they succeed doing so . while " get shorty " entertain you still good movie , ultimately i still find some weaknesses movie whole . john travolta career ultimately defined characters he portrayed . one thing probably hurt john travolta movie career he sometimes put into some real " lemon " type roles . this seen throughout 1980s . prime example this travolta playing " rolling stone " magazine reporter adam lawrence 1985 " perfect " - bad movie bad match role travolta . same time , better travolta matches up character - better movie . travolta performances " saturday night fever "' ss tony manero " grease "' danny zucco prime examples how well travolta matched up character . it completely fair add " get shorty "' chili palmer list characters travolta matches up very well . fact , this might one his best roles . story " get shorty " follows : chili palmer miami loan shark collector who big fan movies . when his " boss " dies , chili arch-enemy ray " bones " barboni ( played brilliantly dennis farina ) becomes his new boss . ray sends chili las vegas collect debt . while collecting debt , chili learns person who owes money - low-budget movie producer harry zimm ( played gene hackman ) . when chili heads los angeles meets up harry , he becomes intrigued getting into movie business . harry in-debt , chili convinces harry take him producer film doing . however life isn't going easy . harry also dealing some loan-shark characters los angeles - most notably one named bo catlett ( played delroy lindo ) . it turns out bo wants movies well . chili soon team-up actress karen flores ( played rene russo ) who worked harry . chili karen job going convince karen ex-husband - big time movie star martin weir harry movie . ultimately , loan-sharking dynamics ray , bo , chili ultimately going come into play everyone going want either collect their debts and/or get fair share harry movie . one thing makes travolta character chili palmer stand out going flawless smooth delivery his dialogue . this always travolta staple going back his vinny barbarino ( " welcome back kotter " ) tony manero days . this especially evident each time when chili confronts someone he says " look me " . however there many one-liners chili palmer deliver - help build his character throughout movie . one my favorite parts when harry introduces bo chili his " associate " . when bo questions chili who he really , chili replies very smooth manner : " it what he said , i'm his associate " . addition dialogue , chili palmer going some great scene presence . this best seen each time chili " appears " someone room . there three other significant performances stand-out this movie . gene hackman very nice job playing low-budget filmmaker harry zimm . hackman might one most busy versatile actors business . he lot movies - but also very adaptable any-type role . delroy lindo portrayal l.a. mobster bo catlett terrific . like travolta , he flawless portraying someone who very " smooth " character . finally , dennis farina portrayal miami mobster ray " bones " barboni also outstanding . farina plays very similar-type character jimmy serrano " midnight run " . he going lot quick one-liners really going highlight movie . also worth noting " sopranos " star james gandolfini plays " bear " - collector bo catlet t.t here also three uncredited performances : bette midler plays girlfriend harry zimm , penny marshall cameo end movie director , david groh ( famous " rhoda " ) going play martin weir agen t.t here two problems this movie . while i find storyline entertaining , i find it extremely confusing keep up specific " details " story - namely who who who what . perhaps this traces back original elmore leonard novel which this book based . i usually prefer my films " simpler " level - i think would helped this story . other problem i found ending weak . while i think this movie very good job not " dragging out " ending , i ultimately found ending bit anti-climatic . it ultimate let-down movie despite confusing " details " plot , provide entertaining edge . overall , i think when we look back john travolta career someday - chili palmer going one his best remembered ones . despite some weak points , this still one movie i'd recommend	1

i'm not big fan existentialism start out , but i began this play expecting least find interesting theme or philosophy concerning nature life existence . this work , however , pure tripe . critical appraisal should not even attempted this drivel- it akin random scribblings two-year old or mud-splattered canvas . drawing front cover more artistic value than this play . my mind , it doesn't merit serious consideration analysis , because it nature pure absurdity nonsense . beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented " extremely difficult themes " " brilliant artistry " play	-1

this movie hilarious !!! okay , it may not oscar material exploding computer graphics , touching dialogue , or emotional nostalgia , but it everything great comedy should ... well-developed ( though bit steriotypical ) characters , social sattire ( case wal mart ) , fast , funny script extremely comedic antics throughout . though humor bit crude times , it very clever , quick , witty . minor slapstick stunts awesome , though this movie it plot not overly original , many scenes ideas displayed . i suppose if you nit-pick this movie appart judge every aspect then you may not enjoy it much i . however , this movie not made judged , it made entertain ; it , side-splittingly-well , i might add ! this movie awesome ... far funniest movie fall 2006 ! i highly recommend it !!	1
director : d.j. carusocast : angelina jolie , ethan hawke , kiefer sutherland , gena rowlands , oliver martinez , tcheky karyo , jean-hughes anglade , paul dano . running time : 109 minutesrated violence , gore , language , nudity , scene sex . it no crime emulate which successful . hollywood ' entire history , better or worse , based studios , producers , directors , even actors , tapping into which au courant using their own best advantage . it only when moviemaker so blatantly rips off hew cry goes up cinematic plagiarism ( re : brian depalma unabashed love affair all things alfred hitchcock , so vividly display such films " carrie " , " dressed kill " " body double " ) even then , while those films accused rip-offs their superior progenitors , least they good rip-offs . depalma brand obsessiveness appears afflicted director d.j. caruso his sophomore effort , new suspense thriller , " taking lives " , starring angelina jolie , ethan hawke kiefer sutherland . caruso work reeks so many other latter day suspense classics ( such " seven " " silence lambs " ) , yet he doesn't appear learned his lessons well masters . jolie special agent fbi who called canada help investigation into series killings appear connected . jolie character , we told , special affinity this kind work . she type who garners clues psyche motivations unknown killer lying down site where victim found . ostensibly , she some kind extra sense serial killers , something known canadian chief police , former comrade ( possibly lover ) hers when they trained together fbi , trait some other , highly chauvinistic montreal cops ( i.e. " unfaithful "' olivier martinez ) don't buy into . her investigation leads her woman who tells police she just seen son she thought died nearly twenty years , young man she admits very dangerous , shaky eyewitness most recent serial killings , art dealer played hawke , suspicious mysterious man played sutherland . police believe they zeroed killer , who some connection hawke , so they use him bait , but case these movies , all not what it appears . director caruso borrows heavily look feel such films silence lambs seven . much taking lives shot dark , dank basements or closeted rooms , shards light penetrating through cracks walls . dismembered and/or rotted bodies tumble secret hiding places , dropping into frame right cue maximum scare monitor . problem , we've seen all this before , most people get weekly dose this kind ghoulish forensic foray television csi : crime scene investigation , so scare tactics never really initiate same fright sensibility . all-star cast their best rise above pedestrian screenplay , but even they hamstrung script mediocrity . jolie , putting perhaps most mainstream performance her career , sensual , sexy , tough determined , quintessential female heroine mold jodie foster clarice starling . unfortunately , her character too many vestiges foster , exception eroticism simply comes angelina jolie . hawke all nervous ticks twitches almost give away too much , while sutherland , hiatus his heroics tv 24 , gives perhaps film most subtle performance , seductively menacing .

big fan roeg , bowie , sci-fi general , i intrigued enough purchase new criterion edition blind buy ( also aided my decision some positive reviews friends whose opinion i trust ) . overall , i think it great decision , if bit pricey . david bowie stars thomas jerome newton , who we first see stumbling around disoriented earth . he technical genius privately arranges meet one oliver farnsworth - scientific breakthrough lofty business plan mind . farnsworth quickly becomes his company manager begins amassing wealth thomas , who wants become rich reasons known only him . scientist , nathan bryce , also commissioned part research development - this time space project . around same time thomas meets young naive girl , mary lou , who helps save his life cares him ( eventually becomes his lover , despite thomas wife ) . while all this going , rival corporation noticed newton success keen bring his empire technology down . course , film like this , none matters all . that because thomas [ i]presumably[/i ] alien who come earth order save his small desert planet his family , who appear only survivors after two successive nuclear wars wrecked havoc planet atmosphere . i say " presumably " because , despite obvious ( scene his eyes , i say no more ) subtle ( his constant need water , his reactions moving fast speed ) visual performance/dialogue clues , film ends rather ambiguously this crucial point . my mind , possible layer newton not alien all rather fascinating . however , if taken surface only , nicolas roeg concocted visually sonically impressive sci-fi classic , fine appropriate misanthropic moody performance david bowie . roeg takes his time develop story around loose framework novel but uses number interesting visuals abstract imagery/metaphor order convey his major themes - loneliness vices man , ruthlessness corporate commercial world , way we would potentially react such visitor ( malice ) . other major theme , course , sexuality power sex destroy ; bryce considered problem because his taste very young women , newton fateful encounter mary lou , however control he may appear first , ends up doing same she introduces him joys follies human sexuality also alcohol ( which screws his system causes hallucinations - much like real life us humans , eh ? ) . film not without flaws . there number bizarre dialogue exchanges , especially newton mary lou , nothing enhance plot or development either character . one particularly fascinating but pretentious sex scene , using gun lot firing blanks sexual allegory , goes forever utterly pointless without context stage film . strange disturbing visual cues abound some particularly effective , but frequent use naked bodies writhing around some kind oatmeal throughout film silly . not nearly enough time spent reasons motivations how exactly newton intends save his planet . still , straightforward linear film would far less compelling not what roeg intended make anyway . it said writer accompanying interview roeg let spirit book guide his choices , large extent true ; he remain faithful [ i]spirit[/i ] narrative not deviate central plot . his distinct visual sense astonishing behold those unfamiliar his work . however , grade film dips slightly because flaws outlined above regard pacing , structure , story . despite all , i'm glad i bought it look forward seeing it again commentary order absorb all details i missed first time . excellent but difficult challenging piece science fiction visionary director - it amazing think " star wars " only year away ....	1

en la puta vida very well made , polished , intelligent film uruguay begins what seems comedy develops into provocative drama - much way events life mimic such changes . director co-writer beatriz flores silva knows her way around tough subject matter able bring out sterling performances very fine cast . elisa ( very beautiful talented marianna santangelo ) hairdresser two children , born different fathers , who lives her mother while trying convince her latest paramour garcia ( augusto mazzarelli ) leave his wife marry her . she dreams her own salon rich district montevideo stop nothing achieve her goal . when her life falls apart she desperate make enough money open her salon , she invited into world fast money ( prostitution ) her best friend lulu ( andrea fantoni ) , enters tutelage madame dona jacqueline ( terrific cameo graciela esuder ! ) . her new role elisa encounters handsome but wily placido ( played silvestre ) who invites her bed barcelona , spain promises she make so much money she not only able send money back her children , but also more than enough open her salon fanciest part her native montevideo . elisa lulu join other prostitutes this promise wealth fly barcelona - unexpected white slavery . there she works her corner but presence gang brazilian transvestites controlled mob . she arrested policeman-with-heart marcelo ( very handsome gifted actor jose ' aka josep ' linuesa ) when her ' man ' placido reveals himself what he ( greedy , heartless pimp ) , elisa works marcelo uncover mob violence streets gain return her beloved montevideo . how story ends left pleasure viewer . apparently this story based some degree fact : 1980s present many latin american women promised wealth joining prostitution business spain only become victims white slavery . director silva able make this rather terrifying reality into story , though sensual , never bad taste : story more important portraying sex-for-sale scenes . mariana santangelo very fine actress this film just right vehicle put her ranks international stardom . photography both uruguay spain beautiful , musical score exceedingly well written evocative , end result film opens door uruguayan films taken seriously . highly recommended	1
all quiet western front finally gotten dvd it deserves . after languishing years stopgap dvd release difficult hear terrible picture quality , this classic anti-war film restored library congress digitally remastered . results fantastic . note : this review refers new universal cinema classics release ( black case close-up lew ayres ) , not some older releases ( bluish monochrome case german helmet ) which amazon seen fit post this review . picture : huge improvement . previous release dull , low-resolution , sometimes blurry , reproduced lots lots distracting scratches dirt old reels . now picture crisp , very sharp , clean it ever . sound : huge improvement . 1930-vintage sound effects still rather clunky dialogue hard understand once or twice , but overall restoration phenomenal improvement . very good . there no special features speak , although dvd include later , probably 1940s-era trailer introduction turner classic movies ' resident film historian robert osborne . restoration sound image big selling points , here . only negative thing i say pretty trivial -- there no chapter menu . this only minor concern , though , no way detracts quality dvd or film itself . if you've waiting good release all quiet western front or never seen it , this dvd now time . highly recommended	1

i went into my viewing ' departed ' more than bit cynicism . seen film ' departed ' based upon - hong kong thriller ' infernal affairs ' - i prepared take snobbish view original far superior . adding my skepticism neat little line i read press effect hollywood just bestowed upon martin scorsese its best picture prize what , most opinions , approximately mr. scorsese sixth-best film . [ instance , ' departed ' could second-coming ' godfather ' no way could it surpass brilliance scorsese ' goodfellas . ' i hope there more than few voters now kicking themselves casting their votes ' dances wolves ' - film hasn't aged well all , especially given costner post-wolves car wreck career vs . scorsese decades-long brilliance . ] anyway , surprise , surprise : ' departed ' brilliant its own merits . it borrows - but not copy exactly - alan mak felix chong original conception . three things make ' departed ' succeed : 1 . scorsese uncompromising vision - ' infernal affairs ' featured some some pulled punches : fateful fall building ends bloodless , almost artful landing car roof ; ending seems crafted sequel mind ( , indeed , ' infernal affairs ' spawned profitable trilogy ) . no such pullback scorsese : same fateful fall results shocking splatter blood ; film brutal denouement - which ends quite differently original - lays waste any possibility sequel . 2 . william monahan brilliant adaptation - his script mashes up mak/chong ' affairs ' tale elements ' brothers bulger . ' result hand-in-glove fit its boston setting . , native bostonian , i found most accents spot-on , led locals mark wahlberg matt damon . 3 . damon/dicaprio/wahlberg triumvirate - these three guys outstanding . damon continues choose great roles perform brilliantly them . he key film , sell covert version himself both his police superiors movie audience . he goes full-out , southie-bred bostonian here . it awesome portrayal . those who think that not acting , compare him here vs . takes jason bourne tom ripley . this guy force . dicaprio his equal here , but surprise here wahlberg . his role simply didn't exist ' affairs .

throughout last couple weeks , my class studying much ado aboutnothing . shakespear amazing writer my opinion . he able write so little , yetget his entire , deep point across . play called much ado nothing becausethroughout entire play there fighting crying decieving .. what ? nothing . i beleive i learned lot it . not only shakespeares sytle ofwriting , but love too . answer question whats shakespeares purpose forwriting , i think carefully . but i beleive his point writing show thereal meaning love . throughout entire play , there people loving each other andnot knowing it , loving each other but not knowing each other .. it just hugemess . claudio hero " love first site " but claudio beleived what he thought hesaw hero doing roof , which proves he didnt know her well he should tolove her . so i think shakespeare makes you wonder if their love true or not . thisstory many values it one could learn . i , personally learned something veryimportant which i not seen before- how easily people mistake love lust . anexample this would when claudio hero met . they no idea who each otherwere , not even something simple their names , yet they " love " . i not seehow you possibly love someone first site . called lust . i alsolearned something very important which i not seen before- how stupid people actwhen they love . example people acting weird stupid when they inlove would benedict beatrice . first , they hated each other . play starts outwith them cruel , rude , sarcastic one reader knows there issomething them . then , when they both deceived told they love oneanother , they start prancing around like fairies . although this funny , it very weirdand confusing same time their emotions towards each other just changeautomatically . example would claudio hero second wedding . afterall this love talk , when their love put out into public , they start deny it saythey just friends . love makes them act so weird , but they end up deciding betogether which i believe good . this play not extremely hard understand , yethas meaningful story . it written old english so probably most difficultthing understand it . i would recommend it someone who could use goodlaugh because all comic relief it . there loads sarcasm its written aninteresting way . after all , it shakespeare . i would not , however , recommend this bookto someone who expecting deep , poetic , tragic story because they simply notgoing get it . this story isn't complex nor it deep . it all , really , just much ado aboutnothing . i enjoyed book , one ; because i could understand what going onthroughout whole thing , two ; because writing funny it kept meentertained . so , id really recommend it anyone	1

this 1954 film directed billy wilder featuring audrey hepburn , humphrey bogart , william holden , good . sabrina fairchild ( played hepburn ) , daughter chauffeur , first dreamy , energetic teenager who swoons over playboy son ( holden ) wealthy family employs her father . she father live over garage . sabrina sent paris learn fine cooking , comes back sophisticated , mature-appearing young woman . playboy falls love her , rest story involves complications hijinx resulting , gradual replacement him sabrina love interest his older , more responsible brother ( bogart ) who captain-of-the-family-industries , larrabee empire . " surprise " ending , bogart joins hepburn ocean liner he manipulated her into taking back paris . sad ending quickly becomes happy ending . i didn't find it interesting some other hepburn films , especially roman holiday , funny face , breakfast tiffany . like all her well-known films this period , sabrina wonderful reflection politics era , particularly evolution " american century , " where european cities gradually replaced new york center civilization . this one still romanticizes paris , presents it center love , self-discovery , real values . ( paris takes severe hit funny face , then totally replaced nyc breakfast . ) really interesting thing me , though , how wealthy portrayed . while there certain amount personal ridicule aimed family scion - elderly mr. larrabee - younger larrabee sons - playboy captain industry - treated sympathetically . they exhibit loyalty their happy servants , kindness their office employees , , deep down , two brothers love each other unselfishly . end , family empire expanded through marriage , captain industry admits love into his life . happy ending everyone . visage capitalism , shored up witch hunt , gets extreme makeover american century chuggs forward . hollywood doing its job this movie . i didn't find this very good role bogart ( originally carey grant signed up part ) , he seemed stiff unreal throughout movie . his shift emotions towards sabrina didn't seem very convincing , though his captain-of-industry type better . but there lot humorous scenes involving plastic , alcohol , glass , well little mockeries business world french cooking classes . i'm sure some people would find some themes , like symbolism moon , inspiring . it all quite enjoyable .	1
i recently rented watched _hollywoodland_ , starring diane lane , ben affleck , bob hoskins , adrian brody , recommend it anyone who kid during 1950s , kid who watched tv _adventures superman_ , starring actor george reeves . i still get knot my throat when i hear music series , hear those opening words : " -- superman , disguised mild-mannered reporter , clark kent . " george reeves death shocked children across nation , but mr. reeves might committed suicide unfathomable . man steel killed himself . we difficult time grasping concept . he died auto accident , or even murdered , we might grasped better impermanence life , his life . but george reeves might put gun his head taken his life surreal . actor icon superman one-and-the-same us . how could he want die ? most all , how could he abandon us way he ? some these questions addressed movie , film stands out my mind memorable because not only props costumes , vintage cars sets but diane lane performance too . she steals film toni mannix . i visually took sets , i wondered myself why i always thought 1950s " ugly days " regarding fashion trends american history . furniture seemed boring me then -- even now . i would never want buy any it , except collectible : but cars , cars fantastic . hollywoodland stylish nostalgic film takes you back late 1950s , when dollar vast fortune bought you bag abba zabba candy bars , atomic fireballs , bazooka bubble gum , slew comic books , fast track into zone , lots trading power . if you remember days , you enjoy movie . very recommended .	1

first off , i'll admit i bought this movie because my favorite actor plays villain , but that not why i keep watching it . inspectors amazing job pulling together all sorts differing elements make it so much more than just mystery or action flick . there real depth realism two leads shown actually personal lives . there also bit comedy offset crime scenes despicable actions bad guys . movie isn't very graphically violent . it hasn't rated , but i would say since language isn't gratuitous movie doesn't front row seat effects mail bombs human anatomy , i'd let 15 year old watch it me . it outstanding movie great re-viewing potential	1
aside " breakfast tiffany " " my fair lady , " audrey hepburn didn't get any better than this . hepburn plays ariane chavasse , parisian student cello who becomes enamoured rich , older american , frank flanagan , played gary cooper . flanagan seems like unlikely character return her love , however , he long history womanizing playboy . he even confesses ariane his belief couples " should always behave though they planes " his motto : " he loves runs away , lives love day . " you very easily predict how two going end up , but it happens , film ends , unpredictable , dramatic extremely moving fashion should leave most viewers misty-eyed . maurice chevalier excellent arianne father . some criticized gary cooper " too old , " i think film would absolutely perfect if he few years younger . ( why title my review says " almost perfect . " ) but cooper still excellent choice role . he looked good his age stage presence , time , unrivalled . ( since when tall , handsome , suave , rich men problems attracting younger women ? )	1

this film made very deep impression me , although i'm originally canada , i always introduce myself " new york " when i visit europe , i experienced same kind anti-americanism lampooned this film . also , 13 years ( before i got married ) , i made numerous trips europe , met lots lots european women , some same experiences them characters this film : two american cousins ( fred , naval officer , ted , christian sales exec ) who sharing apartment barcelona , while searching members opposite sex . ted meets woman his dreams , only find out , while lying bed her , she living man . just when this problem seems overcome , fred opens his big mouth places ted hopes marrying woman jeopardy . after falsely accused cia agent barcelona press , fred falsely accused stealing large amount money ted , kicked out apartment , catches his girlfriend bed man , then suffers even greater tragedy film climaxes . while i haven't any similar experiences during my trips spain , i accused cia agent finland , , both finland sweden , bedded women only find out afterwards they married or living men . ( i slept married woman denmark too , but she told me beforehand . ) whit stilman films rely heavily dialogue , dialogue highly interesting stimulating , well funny . he kind american eric rohmer , except much more humor . stilman knows spain well he spent lot time there . ( his wife spain . ) i seen this film three times , each repeat viewing i notice something new . example , one point film , fred picks up some papers off ted desk office asks , " what all these red dots your work ? " it only third viewing i noticed , earlier film , while two cousins conversing their apartment , ted motivational tapes playing background instruct listener mark his work red dot every time he picks it up , encourage him complete work first time . this film would my top ten list favorite movies all time . ( it so good it might even appear my top one list . )	1

you tell this film made robert mulligan . dripping atmosphere timelessness , remember kill mockingbird . many people younger set not get slow pacing realism . horror films today rely very little actual character development storyline . they want their blood they want it now . this film scary because it never lets go its innocent eeriness . these two boys ? he ghost , he psychopath split personality ? what this magical power ? it just game imagination or he become something other ? i love this film because genuine creepiness . far superior sixth sense or even my mind psycho . this what true horror , everyday psychological mystery . stephen king yet write such work , dead zone comes closest . this film impact similar black christmas repulsion but more realistic tone . end , i still am not sure what brother evil begin .	1

i enjoyed this . it moved bit slowly places , i'm intrigued audrey tautou films tend all follow same quirky narrative format ... but it enjoyable . exception her last flick mr. hanks , she seems bit type cast into daisy-like waif who simpers could either turn world herself or blow it wide open -- you never know . story bit hard follow , which probably wasn't helped language barrier translation . usual , i noticed several places where subtitle not match what said all , which shaded things bit differently . it pretty film though , interesting cinematography . war scenes different than you tend see american films . they gross this , but drama around reaction characters experiencing whatever gross thing more than gross things itself . hollywood tends focus yuck its own character . interesting story , though . i loved her vague ocdness	1

this classic movie 1958 , tati plays his usual character mr. hulot . he lives old , rundown part town , while his sister , married manager plastics factory , shiny futuristic house suburbs , lot goofy gadgets . ( course , what presumed future 50s wasn't always what it turned out , sort retrofuturism fun ) . movie very little dialogue , silent-movie like musical score , number gags involving hulot utterly confused modern gadgets her sister house ( fair , few those gags laugh-out-loud funny ) . actually , what i found even more fascinating than retrofuturism mon oncle , watching it now , look old part town where hulot lives ( we see france 20s 30s , still existing 1958 , but soon razed down , it seldom shown color film ) . if tati wanted say old france more humane than new , ugly , futuristic france shown movie , well , he my vote	1

i'm huge george eliot fan . better just get out way show my bias outset . other hand , could made me like it less since film so much live up . fortunately , this bbc mini-series managed it most excellently . characters their lives engrossing film runs long enough ( 210 minutes ) things allowed happen natural pace .... hollywood movies , characters often seem artificial when they change it more fulfill scriptwriter needs than their own . daniel deronda , characters change gradually realistically , plus drama gripping engaging . highly recommended !!	1

i not yet read originating novel , but i just finished watching this movie second time . i renting it . now i'm going buy it - one very few , i almost never buy movies . i must say i found much more it second time . first time not only physical emotional whippings disturb me but , just much , o willing apparent debasement her masters ' disregard her feelings - they only seemed care her obedience . this anti-turnon me . sex scenes not really convincing , nor whippings . i realized i , audience , not asked accept much pain or much pleasure either . male characters much more flat than female ones , particularly o , if they really didn't count . there something this most beautiful woman portrayal which left me thinking it wasn't all simple . bottom line , it abundantly clear this far , far more than sm movie , nor it bondage , submission domination , or any other kind sexual perversion or obsession . some phrases stuck out me , although i'm not sure i'm quoting exactly accurately . narrator said o loved everything everyone came her because it came her request her lover . she said o knew if she lasted end all would given her . o apparent peace mind everything happened her simply didn't gybe debasement/submissive/sexual perversion sort story . she definitely not come across sick . she , times , deeply terrified or ashamed any normal woman would circumstances yet continued freely accept demands obedience those who loved her those who didn't . i puzzled how easily she accepted rene no longer her lover , continued exactly same thing sir stefan . all this indicated something much deeper than anything relatively superficial perversion , infatuation , o-o going . it made far too deep impression first time i saw movie , even without understanding it . it made me think it , reviewer mentioned , hitting some archetypes , something deep human spirit . i began think whole story extended metaphor demands rewards love . when we love , we willingly go through hell sake love -- not just sake lover . love relationship places heavy demands obedience us . it whips us debases us -- love its intimacy always find our weaknesses , their exposure makes us feel naked , beaten debased . but love always allows us freedom opt out , o lovers masters . something deep within us always knows , if we succumb abasement we may feel , accept beating our feelings take , love , real human love , marks us forever o marked , enbles us love loved fully deeply , gives us peace -- indeed , it grants us everything . o shows us how wonderful it become if we not overly defensive our selves service love . movie itself not look dated you would think 1974 movie -- actually , not all . color little unsaturated compared kind color we today , this contributes fantasy clearly spun . i happen enjoy naked women lot , there lot them this movie , fully frontal , more than glimpse , naked unashamed . there few scenes fully clothed very long . i thought all beautiful women , self-possessed , graceful , fully feminine sensual without affected . two brief closeup shots " female genitalia " , one reviewer put it , ( although he apparently didn't even notice them ) , exquisitely - just close enough , just long enough , just modest enough , just open enough . there visual potpourri modern day ( 1974 ) , turn-of-the-century wealth romanticism , even some medieval castles costumes . only thing bothered me even temporarily sir stefan overly-coiffed hairdo , but it didn't take long get past it . it legitimate part his character . best comment all came my wife when movie over . i hasten add there absolutely no submissive or dominative tendencies her all . she said , " wierd . wow . that one very sexy movie "	1

like everyone who read book , i didn't care movie much , but it still its merits . unfortunately music bombastic , overbearing , this vangelis heavy beat though girls racing down beach chariots fire , totally anachronistic . sinead cusack ghastly cotton boys ' mother , what kind american accent she supposed using ? it like nothing earth didn't seem synched up her lip movements . little boy who played thomas , stud who played stephen , tara fitzgerald topax all excellent . what happened tara fitzgerald , only few years ago she would playing rose , she ingenue every british movie imported into us theaters . sad way time flutters today hot young thing now playing tomorrow stepmother ! her hair looked like hair old hag walter scott novel-one who lives cave . i thoroughly approve romola garai cassandra mortmain . i thought she perfect part . rose byrne not gorgeous i hoped , rose , her huge cheeks beady little eyes . she looked ghastly gained 20 years when mrs. cotton cut off her makeup artists should painted over distracting blemish her face grew worse throughout movie . however she perfectly piquant exotic pink crinoline dress black shoes red feather her hair she wote when bringing her family dinner cottons . cassandra blue dress she wore nightclub also lovely . henry thomas marc blucas also underwhelming . blucas used so good looking riley finn tv version buffy vampire slayer . here he looked pasty unfit . henry thomas doing all his acting his eyes . he seemed leading cassandra during their dance " you night music . " it mesmerizing , but i once thought he love her , afterwards he said he kissed her just because she so funny amusing sweet . right . finally i'm two minds bill nighy . he always same every picture , but i think his manic , worn-out quietude fitting james mortmain . you could believe he writer , even though not james joyce-style writer he get dodie smith book	1
movie : **** dvd transfer : **** extras : *** this ultra low-budget film released poverty row monogram pictures much better than studio standard fare , thanks artistry fine cast few capable technicians . script philip yordan typical biographical whitewash job bears only passing resemblance true story 1930 gangster john dillinger ; yet it works just fine piece noir crime drama , sturdy dialogue interesting characters . his first starring role , lawrence tierney acquits himself well dillinger ; lovely anne jeffreys ( although anachronistic her 1940 fashions hairstyle ) turns fine performance his treacherous moll . but real acting honors shared four actors who comprise tierney original gang : former silent star edmund lowe ; veteran character player eduardo ciannelli ; craggy-faced marc lawrence ; always reliable elisha cook , jr. each these men given brief but ample opportunity shine , each one makes most his turn spotlight . also note musical score dimitri tiomkin , moody black white cinematography jackson rose . warner brothers dvd release this film offers unexpectedly fine picture audio quality . it must kept mind keep production costs down , " dillinger " includes many snippets stock footage other films , this generic footage filmed different times varying film grains , hodge-podge technical styles . presented here , it all blends fairly seemlessly , only few really rough spots standing out . dvd includes serviceable audio commentary john milius , director 1973 " dillinger " ; his sometimes meandering remarks intercut old excerpts interview screenwriter yordan . original theatrical trailer also included ... see if you don't agree " time " magazine quote trailer end ( " dillinger reached unmatched heights daredevil ruthlessness !

perhaps first social injustice movies hollywood began turning out late forties , crossfire one few my opinion which still hold up . that because social message , against hate general anti-semitism particular , doesn't become too preachy get way story . unlike gentleman agreement ( anti-semitism ) , boomerang ( legal class injustice ) , pinky ( racial prejudice ) others , crossfire tells taut story first , this case murder , features some first-rate acting , especially robert ryan . murder mystery straightforward there little doubt who killer . we know man named samuels ( sam levene ) beaten death . we know suspect , corporal arthur mitchell ( george cooper ) one four recently discharged soldiers who met him bar . we know one four big , edgy guy , sergeant montgomery ( robert ryan ) , who laughs too much likes verbally poke people he thinks weak . body discovered , evidence points mitchell killer police captain finlay ( robert young ) goes work . one mitchell buddies , sergeant peter keeley ( robert mitchum ) doesn't think mitchell could killer . cautious way he starts working finlay establish alibi mitchell , then concentrate montgomery . one biggest issues what could montgomery motivation . it turns out montgomery doesn't like civilians , doesn't like " hillbillies , " hates jews . he bigot . when montgomery complains " those kinds guys " , finlay asks , " what kind guys ? " " you know kind . " montgomery says . " played it safe during war , keepin ' themselves civvies , nice apartments , swell dames ... you know kind . " " i'm not sure i . " " some ' em named samuels , some ' em funnier names . " it isn't long before we realize montgomery psychopath who hates just anyone who different . keeley help , finlay finally able lay clever trap montgomery . young fine job cop . he seen probably too much . he tired . he decent man who relies his training . " i've this job too long , " he tells keeley . " i go it only way i know how . i collect all facts possible ... most them useless . " mitchum , laconic but alert , makes nice partner finlay . he ready stand buddy he thinks incapable killing , he really doesn't like montgomery . robert ryan makes you feel uncomfortable moment you see him . there something too friendly him , something too hidden , something too ready explode . you're not surprised when he suddenly beats samuels death his fists . difference part keeley part montgomery , i think , difference role lead reputation movie star role lead reputation movie actor . i think it only when mitchum took unsympathetic roles night hunter cape fear many critics realized he first-rate film actor , not just star . time , ryan already actor reputation , but major stardom eluded him . smaller part , gloria grahame excellent dance hall hostess who might give mitchell alibi . her cat eyes pouty lips , grahame always distinctive . she paul kelly man who may or may not her husband bring uneasy almost surreal quality their scenes . crossfire solid looking noir . dvd presentation very good .	1

let me say immediately this movie requires some upfront investment : patience , attention , sympathy . it not easy sit four hours view " news " that sixty years old . but once you get past initial impediments , what you get clear window into events themselves clear windows into human motivations their consequences . ophuls examines one city , examines how collaborators resistance fighters played lethal chess . he interviews probes . what emerges after four hours weird sensation you actually present interviews -- you camera -- that highest praise anyone give documentary . incidentally , one bonus watching this you get vivid context many other french movies take place during this dramatic period history , e.g. , " hiroshima mon amour " " le dernier metro .	1

i saw this movie when i 25 years old , same age michael o'keefe , very good young actor . i agree reviewer his range emotions ... anger , love , compassion , superbly expressed . i think he should won best supporting oscar time , but instead academy gave it timothy hutton ordinary people ( fabulous young actor ) . robert duvall , course , brilliant always . i seen movie several times , each time it reminds me two struggles duvall : dominance over everyone around him , struggle masculinity father son ( duvall o'keefe ) . this struggle interesting study father who very proud but yet threatened , manly sensitiveness , athletic ability , spunk his own son . first indication this when they playing basketball together . o'keefe typical vigorous 17-year-old ( almost 18 ) , expertly dribbling shooting duvall into increased anger frustation . i think very quick whack duvall gave o'keefe butt o'keefe slightly bending over , very skillfully dribbling ball away duvall , first indication he his father .. boss . you don't embarrass boss beating him . i even thinking , because duvall such jerk -- please michael , let your father win ! next , terrible scene performed so well -- when duvall , furious o'keefe not relent giving him two point extension , stadiscally bobs ball o'keefe head , humiliating him calling him his favorite girl . o'keefe retaliates yelling " this girl whipped your ass good , colonel ! " . i thought duvall would start physically fighting his son smart , but retort so smart , it left duvall silent paralyzed . those two chemistry , truly great together . watch it , performances move you much story typical but challenged , military family	1

what interests me truffaut godard very simple story its ability convey nihilism main characters . i believe it deserves least much attention any evolutionary film making leaps went into film making . story simple enough : michel poiccard ( jean paul belmondo ) petty thief whom within first five minutes his appearance screen cops his tail because he stolen car . not particularly bright , he shots patrolman who pulls him over leaves scene crime rife incriminating evidence . rest film , some eighty odd minutes consists michel chasing down money owed him earlier petty crimes ; trying keep one step ahead police know what they know his whereabouts ; hanging out trying sleep patricia francini ( jean seaberg ) , american student sorbonne sometime writer herald-tribune -- one gets impression reason she him it artistically inspired slumming novel she working . it patricia who ultimately betray michel when her future paris threatened possibility loss her visa passport she willingly leads police him . while they still partners we given interesting look paris underworld . world petty thievery criminals margins society who primary subject breathless group godard good position expostulate upon . become totally obsessed cinema while he student sorbonne , ostensibly studying ethnology , he cut his families finances when they found out ostensibly meant not all he subsist through petty theft . film -- working often biography michel -- shows world inactivity . we see him sleeping , trying put together money owed him , comparing clothes other petty thieves trying keep patricia amused hopefully bed . he absolutely no short term goals his one ambition , going italy little more than pipe dream totally unrealistic . michel lives world totally sensory sensual . there nothing his character suggests he could go beyond this , or he wishes . even worse than his sloth , fact he total moral bankrupt : his code conduct so totally self-interested egocentric frightening . word , it degenerate . patricia michel counterpoint film though she comes different class background long term goals presumably not parasitic -- journalist novelist -- she just morally repugnant he . although bright , intelligent well educated she totally self-absorbed . dwight macdonald points out bedroom scene patricia michel " ... it becomes evident , through many small touches dialogue expression , each lover so bound childish ego unable make contact other , they emotionally impotent . " patricia self-centeredness seen her reading faulkner michel insisting its beauty ( he not speak english ) her constant changing facial expressions mirror her insistence michel acknowledge beauty renoir reproduction hangs her wall . neither trying connect other any but most superficial level . they simply using each other . it may not evil , but it certainly amoral . two amoral characters would not all threatening , but pauline kael points out , what makes film so disturbing just how little characters give damn anything . " this new race lives moment because all they care . " group people michel representative marginal no stake society , not accept tenets loyalty or even code conduct going beyond meeting satiating immediate wants . patricia just dangerous different reasons though . although she vision future herself " she so free she no sense responsibility guilt .... codes love loyalty ... depend stronger emotions than her idle attachment this lover .... " people like this represent danger society goes beyond their numbers because damage they totally out proportion their numbers . what finally makes breathless so unique amongst underworld films its differences gangster films preceded it . michel almost polar opposite rico bandello . where rico chaste , michel fornicator . where rico obsessed power making it , michel could care less long there cars steal fun . they both ultimately brought down their big egos stupidity though .	1

plot details : this opinion reveals major details movie plot . dario argento opera viewed some sort comeback effort after his 1985 film phenomena ( a.k.a. creepers ) garnered lukewarm reviews failed register lot his fans . lot fans really looked forward opera since it got back his giallo ( italian thrillers where most movie shown killers point-of-view showing his usually gloved hands ) roots lacked some ridiculous elements his insect thriller phenomena . while opera nowhere close suspiria ( 1977)or deep red ( 1975 ) terms greatness , i felt it improvement over his last giallo , 1982 tenebre . opera deals beautiful young opera singer who starring extremely avant-garde production macbeth . she ends up stalked obsessed fan who ties her pole , puts pins under her eyes ( so she'll gouge out her eyes if she tries shut them ) , tapes her mouth shut murders people right front her some very graphic bloody ways . movie some respects lot common phantom opera . expected dario argento film , opera absolutely breathtaking visually . his camera moves fluidly movie features some insane angles shots . actual opera macbeth movie equally visually captivating . dario mentioned he always wanted his own movie version macbeth , but wasn't able one reason or , so opera gave chance sort some fun it . killings movie also very graphic bloody , punctuated some really bad heavy metal music . first murder particular very gruesome shot knife shoved through man neck into his mouth . i also very impressed scene where woman killed while looking through peep hole : killer shoots her through head through hole , bullet continues out back her skull , striking phone that behind her . dario one few directors who take extreme violence turn it into something dark beauty . where movie really lacking some acting . i noticed actors act great one scene , only appear they're sleepwalking through next . this especially apparent young woman playing lead . ending also very poor seemed out place . after watching documentary making film recent anchor bay re-release , filmmakers even admit ending didn't turn out way they intending it . if movie ended 10 minutes earlier , it would turned good movie into great one . opera probably go down last decent film dario argento made . he went make some terrible films like trauma , stendhal syndrome atrocious remake phantom opera . i haven't seen his latest film entitled sleepless , but i've heard it return his deep red roots . whether it any good question , but i really like think dario least one more great film him . one only hope !	1

' santa claus movie ' huge childhood favorite mine . there not many christmas movies out there tell such original story how santa claus came . it not only mesmorizingly creative fairy tale leaves you feeling like warm chocolate chip cookie just taken out oven christmas eve but it leaves all religous aspects christmas out so everyone enjoy it , wich way holiday truly deserves . my baby brother 11 years old although he trying very hard ( his age ) hold magic he asking alot questions this year . so christmas eve i read him verginia o'hanlons famous " yes verginia there santa claus " letter , afterwards we watched ' polar exspress ' finished night off this classic when it all over first thing he run out kitchen , grab some left over christmas eve cookies we made earlier night couple carrots , poured tall glass milk wrote note santa said following " hello santa ! even though my friends school don't believe you don't you worry because i still . here some cookies milk you carrots your reindeer . i love you santa clause " . if only one more year i could help him believe , well then " mission acomplished " i definitely thank makers this little holiday classic assisting me my magic capturing endeavor .	1
after framed his own psychiatrist into believing he responsible string murders , man named aaron boone leaves his human life behind sets off search legendary underground city midian , reputed home monsters called nightbreed . exact line reasoning behind this course action , many interesting paths it could taken , isn't fully explored , leads into only but not-insignificant flaw " nightbreed " : it fantastic movie , many ways " lord rings " or " star wars " horror movies , but it way too short . clocking little over hundred minutes , it should gone least 40-45 minutes longer my mind , could easily gone over ; there so many angles characters , too much movie feels somewhat scrunched together . now , i no idea if it actually meant longer or if this what clive barker originally envisioned , but personally i think it needed more screen time . my dream scenario would find out more material actually filmed see version extended 60-70 minutes come out , but fact remains what here , dvd still great movie , despite awkward feeling certain parts movie seem flow far too quickly . upon arrival midian , boone ( pursued both his girlfriend lori , who wants save him , his psychiatrist dekker , who seeks nightbreed his own purposes ) received breed their prophecied messiah cabal , who finally free them human persecution they've encountered over ages due their monstrous appearances frightful powers . nightbreed presented more creatures than demons , such film falls under banner i great affection , where ' monsters ' good guys humanity aggressor . although " nightbreed " there lot grey black white ; some human characters very sympathetic some nightbreed apparantly considerably more ill-natured than others , perhaps even responsible hatred their entire race prone through history . creature concepts effects grand production design truly magnificent - fact " nightbreed " received no consideration movie establishment big award bodies demonstrates just how reticent academy other bodies give nominations any horror movie , no matter how brilliantly . there seems slight thaw big players dislike horror last few years , so who knows , maybe future movies this nature eligible . explosive finale seemed leave door wide open sequels , but nothing ever come them either movies or books beyond nightbreed comic series ran couple years ( one point brought rawhead rex into mix ) , which seemed present breed much nastier less sympathetic than movie . film sequel may never come , but remains list movies i'd just love see suddenly rear up out blue someday . some cool trivia barker fans : not only craig sheffer ( lead actor " hellraiser : inferno " ) play boone , three performers who portrayed cennobites first two " hellraiser " movies present here well : simon bamford ( ' butterball ' cennobite ) , nicholas vince ( chatterer ) doug bradley ( pinhead himself ) . spite too little time reach its maximum potential , still essential horror movie , very original truly epic scope	1
idea counterfactual , course . no surprise . but such ideas allowed , this one full possibilities , both comic dramatic . none those possibilities explored this film . instead , this garden-variety teen flick . it pushes all teen buttons . caveman morphs into california hip teen less than two minutes , that end caveman such . three boys rock dancing , ride roller coaster , rock dancing , play arcade games , rock dancing , roller coaster , rock dancing , arcade games , roller coaster , rock dancing , etc . ad nauseum . top it off , caveman pacifist who wouldn't hurt flea , not even defend himself . yeah , right . social commentary , psychological insights could evoked clever development this idea ! truly comic situations caveman could gotten into ! it time someone made grownup movie starting this idea . people who made this film clearly didn't know what this splendid idea . or , use word they would likely understand , they clueless .	-1
absolute time capsule 1950s rock roll . some best rock day . unfortunatley artists dont get perform entire songs , but they still great . what said jayne mansfield ? she stunning ! seeing her red gown reason enough buy this movie . supporting players great .

mahatma gandhi indians call him indeed mahatma(a great soul)(but i rarely saw usage word mahatma western world , which i guess they don't like use ) . his life message-message love , peace , acceptance , tolerance , finally it tells us you should fight out love something not because hatred towards others . he fought independence people because he loved it not hated britishers . strictly , only handful number people led such accomplished complete life . he died only after seeing nation india free . movie , it very touching definitely inspires us . what i like quote his , read out end where he says " some point every evil looks invincible , but end they always lose . it happens always , always , always " . remember hitler , course british empire . present times when there more more injustice(under cover good ) , this should truly help those faintly lit souls standing hope society filled justice , love , peace	1
i've never laughed and/or smiled so much my life . my face literally hurt after watching this movie . films darren stein ( director ) made his childhood friends way more ambitious than anything my friends or i made child . we pretty much stuck straight horror , whilst darren company tackled such heady themes holocaust , child abuse , nuclear war . my favorite part : little girl screaming " no , mommy , no ! " monotone while her mother " beats " her ( little girl barely suppressed laughter audible throughout ) . other parts worthy mention include concentration camp " execution " scene ( shot suburban living room ) " bank robbery " scene ( also shot what appears same living room ) . what makes film really special , however , watching young darren exhibit signs truly manipulative , megalomaniacal film director . it sweet , also little bit scary . this film must all artists , writers , filmmakers , musicians who knew what they wanted early age .	1
i don't know why most reviewers seem hate this movie ! but i guess it because it not typical vampire movie or typical horror movie actually more mystery suspense movie but i actually thought it good movie i enjoyed whole things aren't what they appear plotline i thought ending seemed very original . seems like it would very original back then also now ! not all actors great but bela lugosi lionel barrymore great i highly recommend this movie fans vampire horror movies who also like mystery suspense	1

breezy , delightful musical gene kelly frank sinatra their third final screen partnership . this time , they play baseball players who moonlight vaudeville stars . boys get pleasant shock their new team manager ( esther williams ) who course creates fireworks when both players decide make `play ' her ! curiously enough , renowned " million dollar mermaid " williams spends most her time out water this film , only doing one brief swimming bit title song . broadway comedy darling betty garrett ( who also appeared kelly sinatra town ) plays secondary female lead scores heavily " it fate " . jules munshin , edward arnold tom dugan co-star . highly-recommended	1

while somewhat different than their charming endearing musical films , this entry fred ginger probably my favorite . fortunately all great elements made previous films so wonderful still here , but this time those elements interspersed some nice screwball comedy finally got showcase ginger comedic talents . fred great always , but this one really ginger film , she shines . once again , fine pandro . berman production some magical songs irving berlin made this mark sandrich film sheer joy . original idea marian ainslee guy endore adapted story form dudley nicols hagar wilde , then turned into screenplay allan scott ernest pagano . fred ginger , fine support ralph bellamy , jack carson luella gear , turn all these elements into what , i believe , most " fun " all their films . tony ( fred ) psychiatrist trying his pal stephen ( ralph bellamy ) favor seeing his radio singer fiance amanda ( ginger ) so he figure out why she called off their wedding three times ! she blows fred off quack when she overhears transcription he which less than flattering but finally gives agrees let tony disect her dreams discover what wrong her . meal lobster mayonnaise , lot other things , make her dream alright , but her dream she dancing tony ! amanda can't tell him , course , when he threatens stop seeing her she makes up dream would keep ten psychiatrists busy fun really begins . rogers fabulous this film it impetus her very successful solo career . this light screwball comedy some terrific moments . it laugh riot ginger walks out while hypnotized , thinking she loves bellamy , going after fred shotgun , so he die like dog ! fred tells bellamy while they run after her : " she trance . she may even act , little odd ! " during dream sequence they get dance " i used color-blind " later party they " yam " very fun scene . berlin " change partners " nominated oscar . but ginger screwball comedy take top billing this one , making it one their best . it sophisticated funny , fred ginger end up together always . this time she gorgeous wedding dress , she black eye ! you don't hear much this one , but don't let stop you picking up this wonderful film	1

night fog only 30 minutes long but it manages move one deeply time its conclusion reached . i must share reader this , without qualification , superlative documentary holocaust . narration full judgment condemnation -- which entirely appropriate light its subject matter . footage both color black white . most what one sees auschwitz other concentration camps ( kz ) shot vilianous nazis themselves . meticulous books they kept revealed half-way through ; names dead crossed out red pencil . although i must say i am quite familiar holocaust , many clips night fog previously unknown me . indeed , decapitation device piled heads alongside it shock . side note , while watching this , i could not help but think fact movie like this could not made france today because it society plagued anti-semitism . that tragedy resnais work beyond impressive . we need thousand documentaries this quality . this historical artifact it absolutely worth your purchase . fact , i may go watch it second time .	1
i gave dvd called drunks three stars it earned each them . i just finished watching clean sober i am giving it five stars only because , i am unable give it fifty . clean sober everything drunks not ! clean sober nice tight script made you follow really close keep up . clean sober taught me more than few things drunks druggies . prices drunks clean sober should switched . drunks no where near good clean sober yet drunks cost bit more . i would gladly forked over 3 times $7 price clean sober compared $21.99 drunks not worth its prenium price . both fine movies but clean sober just so much better . clean sober made me think . clean sober emotional roller coaster . i started out hating main character movie . he started out mean self absorbed trite nasty worthless no-account first order . dvd progressed middle point he no better . supporting actors movie awesome , lending sense beleivability movie i liked . everybody seemed mastered those seedy loathesome scamming natures druggies drunks when they seconds away hitting rock bottom . slowly almost impreceptablyi started liking main character . i started thinking awe sweet he going hook up his nice lady friend then her beast boyfriend returns . then she leaves her boyfriend house supposedly get pack smokes i figured she heading back see main character mushy ending lots kissing gurgling noises credits rolled . i won't tell you what happened but i wrong again big time . ending rather shocked me time credits rolled , i almost holding back tears . vile thing time movie ended i honestly liked title character . i never dope addict or alcoholic but i learned something both drunks clean sober . i learned you can't really help dope addict because , help they need comes within themselves . once alcohohic or druggie starts cleaning up their lives picking up peices . i learned you give people recovery opportunities but only once they shown commitment needed rebuild their lives . hardest thing world stand watch some one you love fall into drugs or booze knowing only one who pull them out early grave themselves . thats why i buy movies , because i learn things better when i see them play out front me . this movie left me great joy sorrow but , funniest thing i only really remember joy . clean sober drunks teach addicted people make their own choices their ain't damn thing all love world it . this one my list movies . one last funny thing i almost not buy this movie . i only ended up buying it because , i needed like 4 bucks hit $25 minimum required get free super saver shipping so i tossed it . after seeing it i not imagine my huge dvd collection without clean sober it . clean sober i think must dvd	1

when i first purchased this film vhs some years ago , it because actor tatsuya nakadai . i not all familiar works late director mikio naruse . since viewing " when woman ascends stairs " i only seen one other film this late director , film " late chrysanthemums , " which i also vhs too . i am looking forward purchasing both these films dvd some time . this film particular when it released dvd . my review refers vhs version . when i first viewed this film , i thought it decent , but not particularly great . not seen film number years ; i recently watched it again ; really liked it lot . strange how time sometimes allow us see things differently . i find many films i once liked not appealing anymore , while others seem pull me . this film one grows appreciate . or maybe it mood one ? anyway , i believe this very good film . much better than i initially thought . films main protagonist keiko yashiro ( hideko takamine ) excellent film . film centers around life keiko ; also known mama . her daily life recounted films narrative bar woman ginza bar district , who struggling maintain some sort dignity her life . she widow , fast approaching thirty-years age . daughter , brother she trying help keep out jail , nephew who needs money operation , her life financially difficult . this slow paced film , patience required . but film well worth watch purchase . meanwhile , keiko must deal patrons bar . bar frequented businessmen other clients who want more than just drinks served them : her body one . despite all hardships keiko going through , we see she emerges strong personality , refuses defeated . she inner strength which carries her forward . this film reminded me quite bit late great director kenji mizoguchi films . only here you find woman who strong , not relying men , per se . films narrative follows plight woman bar which frequented men who see her object . yet her pride not allow her debase herself , even if it means financial advancement . one bar characters junko inchihashi ( reiko dan ) she gives very good supporting role film . then there character kenichi komatsu , ( tatsuya nakadai ) who portrays managing bartender film . but heart film we keiko , her desire change her lot life . although keiko not hate her job , she not entirely enjoy it either . director naruse shows viewer this male dominated society , roles women limited life one vicious cycle disappointment : yet keiko carries she tries rise above lifes challenges . keiko , life more than just ascending stairs bar where she works . life difficult , but there always tomorrow . this film highly recommended	1

army vet , i say characters this movie just crazy varied you're likely find any military unit . falling somewhere dirty dozen jacobs ladder , this sleeper not everyone . it pace slow . it full surreal moments . but such life combat zone -- i saw some very surreal things desert storm . i'll admit writers took it little too far couple times , but most their risks worked , these accomplished actors pull it off somehow . overall movie stands out one great commentaries war . if you're not too much literalist , i'd highly recommend this movie .	1

not much written nowadays john hodiak , who plays ned trent this 1946 george sidney musical , but he wonderful presence hollywood cinema 1940s , all his pictures worth look . he seems strangely modern , natural his appeal , some cocky good looks charm our own john travolta . harvey girls one his rare ventures into musical comedy , moviegoers often recall him tougher parts : playing opposite tallulah bankhead hitchcock lifeboat , you know you'd balls steel carry off assignment , or zipping through mexico lucille ball jules dassin noir road trip adventure two smart people . judy garland he noticeably gentler than he usually gets screen ; you almost feel effort involved . he seems more like angela lansbury sort guy , hard , attracted glitter , out good time . then something clicks he garland really start click picture picks right up . dvd features abysmal " march dogies , " piece which so many things wrong it , you see why freed cut it out , but it fascinating its own right it great they saved it . song bad , singing isn't very good , choreography pretty basic , it seems they tried save it adding more more elements number , you almost expect see if not kitchen sink , then village pump , added mix . i suppose they also trying accommodate hodiak limitations dancer . he no ray bolger ( no john travolta ) . but his magnetism carries all before it , like buffalo stampede . hodiak misfortune prominently featured some era most notorious failures , like song russia marriage private affair , but way this proved his salvation he not cursed overfamiliarity which he disregard someone we've seen zillion times , no matter how worthy , like clark gable or gary cooper . he always fresh exhibits new facets his screen personality . he died 1955 , still stranger , after well-publicized marriage fellow thespian ( anne baxter , whom he starred low-key charmer sunday dinner soldier )	1

frances powerful movie tells story very gifted , beautiful smart actress falling apart she struggles fit into hollywood mold her time . it not quite clear if she suffering mental illness if she just overwheled rage frustration which she no outlet , but regardless , like used happen still times , she enters world psychiatric hospital gradually looses her freedom , her life her mind ( literally , sense some point movie she lobotomized ) . she endures all this , we begin understand frances very sick mother , probably more need psychiatric care than her daughter . mother betrays her over over , not allowing her her true self , denying her true needs handling her over butchers psychiatric hospital whenever she feels frances may slipping away her control . this very sad times horrifying story . it may not frances farmer true story however , it seems she may never lobotomy . also it seems she far bigger problem alcoholism than highlighted here . however , this not detract movie , which tells story could true many people era . lobotomy particular " icepick " style lobotomy practiced liberally time variety doctors mental health practitioners , some which not even any kind surgical experience or license . lobotomies this kind , apparently administered war veterans struggling adjust after traumas they endured . now they would dignosed ptsd treated accordingly . eventually lobotomy went out fashion it seen what it : barbaric practice zombified people robbing them their essence , not cure . i hope same said soon electroshock treatments , , believe it or not still used today . history treatement severe mental illness rife horror . many ways we still so very ignorant these matters . this not movie faint heart . however , it important movie many ways . jessica lange performance one best female performances i ever seen . it worth watching this picture just see her act . disturbing yet beautiful powerful movie	1

sean connery made this movie after his bond franchise died . this came out few years after " diamonds forever " . connery ' 83 " never say never again " but that not considered true bond movie . but , i degress , we're talking zardoz . i give movie five stars . it one those mid-1970s science fiction movies cheezy effects , cheezy dialog , fun watch if you've few shots whiskey ice . four years later " star wars " came out . how much movies changed short time . connery part group killers turned farmers who must till earth put food mouth zardoz , flying head goes place place collecting grain feed immortal humans vortex . connery plays " zed " , mutant ( they don't really say what sort mutant he ) who used rape murder his hearts content until forced become farmer . when zardoz comes grain collection zed buried under grain inside grain slips into vortex . vortex area where immortals live . it not easy figure out . i've watched this movie three or four times it shows vortex , simple english village , protected shield . how shield maintained ? we don't know . you look around vortex compound nothing there looks like technology advanced past 1820 . there some plastic things growing plants . they look out place plastic bean bag chairs middle castle . zed job easy . he must figure out way bring down invisible walls vortex so his band marauders take vengence inhabitants . killers must revenge forced become farmers . some ways i look this movie analog what going modern europe . present inhabitants europe bored life . they believe nothing . they nothing . so , they invite muslims full knowledge aim group transform europe something alien european . zardoz quite like . zed brought most everybody knows he death them . this something new modern people ; we invite very people who wish wreck society we helped build . anyway , zed destroys vortex mainframe computer . this part crystal computer " suck " zed into it . acting effects this part movie seem like velveta all over place ; it all just so cheezy . producers movie enlarges photo diamond connery just holds up his hands " falls " into crystal . perhaps i should less judgemental modern computer graphics . now , until final conflict crystal computer there lots stupid things person see . you'll see raiders riding horses shooting guns unlimited supply ammo ; first job raiders reduce population humans before farming could start . you'll see thin nude british actresses throwing themselves everybody any thing . ( connery go through divorce this time ? i see why . ) note , women not " bond " girls . so nudity not sexy . you'll see flying head zardoz who collects food . how he forces collection food not explained . how this head rock flies also not explained . anti-gravity ? we don't know not told . i give movie five stars i simply don't know why ? it entertaining . also , over six foot tall connery looks like near ape when standing 5'7 " thin-as-reeds british actors . i don't think any women weigh more than 110 pounds , 140 men . it great snap shot how thin british people used immediate post wwii era . john lennon peer this group . they all so thin ( or we now all so fat ) . oh heck get movie . it not bad discount . you'll enjoy it . there isn't any politics piss you off . there somewhat good story . it mindless fun entertainment . i enjoy it . trust me . if you get this movie you'll watch it once or twice year . it fun . if you figure out walls vortex make sure post answer this web site . 5 stars . it good mindless fun .	1
don't take this movie more than what it , comedy . it funny , jet li fans won't find what they're looking , if they want typical jet li . it some pretty good fighting scenes end , especially when frankie , turns coward fighting machine . if you watch this movie not expecting much , you'll pleased	1
this osmond production one best family movies out there . it touching story excellent acting marie osmond timothy bottoms all supporting cast well . i particularly like friendship beth mary servant girl . my teenage niece said there only one quot ; cheesyquot ; part when main characters reunite end . i prefer call it touching , lol ! :-) costumes , story line , everything , extremely well . it supports christian family values , there certainly nothing any way offensive . i would highly recommend this one . christmas theme also adds nice touch . i also mention video closed captioned , although it not say so case . i am glad two oldest osmond brothers , who hearing loss , more easily watch their sister this outstanding film	1
this one better " family films " adults would still enjoy , i don ' mean use clich ?. suffice say it fast-moving story , creatively looks super dvd . this stunner , visually-speaking . creativity - especially film 10 years old - involves wonderful special-effects make famous wooden puppet so lifelike . i haven't seen it eight or nine years but when this came out first vhs i remember shocked visuals how real things looked . dvd enhances it notch . this not animated film , story bit different other versions . how faithful this original story , i cannot tell you , because i never big fan story . i tell you , however , martin landau very good playing pinochhio creator " geppetto . " i found it interesting cricket this story called " pepe , " not jiminy cricket . any rate , this nicely-done version famous kids ' story .	1
hal hartley never fails entertain , never fails engage my mind emotions parallel level . simple men no exception . seemingly simple plot - two brothers search their missing dad - provides so much room character growth i wish there entire series films centered around them . hard-edged view world : " there no such thing adventure . there no such thing romance . there only trouble desire " ( actually fritz lang movie 1920 ) there plenty going both prove disprove hartley ambivalent theories . simple men also formally introduces us absolutely delicious elena l�wensohn . one coolest hottest scenes all cinema we get watch her bizarre 50 beatnik-style dance sonic youth " kool thing . " then joined two lost soul brothers it turns into unlikely production number . many dismiss this film , hartley unwatchable or trivial miss point . what amazing hartley he takes seemingly trivial elevates it level art , once seen , reflects our lives every level brilliance inane . simple men pure cinematic delight . hooray hartley	1
oscar-winning director leo mccarey delivers heartwarming touching film only very few weak spots . although film neither revolves around christmas , nor even includes it until near end , it become perennial holiday must-see . even more than half-century later , audiences still enjoy bing crosby father o'malley ( same role he plays not-nearly-so-good bells st. mary ) , laid-back but innovative young priest out rescue failing parish tough new york neighborhood . there other impressive performances but finest barry fitzgerald ( quiet man , how green my valley)as crotchety but good-hearted old irish priest . bing must deal wayward youth , runaway young lady , financial problems . most all , he must deal entrenched ways fitzgerald some his congregants . it gentle , innocent , touching story . although songs might seem bit corny today , they still enjoyable bing honeyed voice always worth listening . this film good addition most any film library , not just your holiday films .	1
i compelled write this review after i read two reviews written salvadorean perspective claiming this movie essentially complete fiction . although , i haven't seen this movie several years i remember it griping shocking account events largely forgotten ( or even noticed back then ) average americans . i wonder if two salvadorean reviewers ever met or talked boyle , journalist whose experience movie based , or if they ever same places boyle during time . moreover , one key events depicted movie actually happen : december 2 , 1980 four american nuns who there giving aid relief poor people country brutally raped murdered group el salvador national guardsmen . like anything we view or read , stone movies should seen critical eye . course his movie not " ultimate truth " what happened 80 el salvador it should not viewed way . instead , it should viewed what it : one man perspective ( boyle ) what he witnessed while he there . how person perspective or account deepen our understanding history ? what questions it raise ? whose interests perspective ( or other perspectives ) serve ? whether this movie " accurate " depiction not important fact this movie get us thinking talking important issues surrounding justice , freedom , equality role our government overtly covertly plays international conflicts where those values stake	1
unlike mr. baker santa clarita , california who rated this item 2 , i think this film deserves much more than jake learn true meaning christmas ; one just pay close attention by-pass all commercialism involved . yes , he start out self-seeking free-wheeling but all changes he learns his hard lessons way . one thing , it starts him getting what he deserves ; punishment some jocks leaving him out desert so hard lessons start here . point , true meaning christmas gets shown him various ways , just wearing santa outfit his hardships spawn some lessons : he willingly sacrifices race winnings good cause ( even though money rightfully his ) , failed marriage gets repaired , crooked " elf " gets reformed life crime , plus one see porsche all forgotten tender moment little esteban hospital who pines his family-no one convince me jake not affected ; he it shows . finally when lesson fully espoused , it remarkable how climax coupled various holiday customs traditions ( christmas , hanukah kwanza ) enmeshed local parade plus group carolers almost overcome running sleigh . then , time limit which determines if he'll receive porsche approaches , he no hurry , but spends few seconds girlfriend watching his family celebrate table through window ; hence , sense family fizzles through . when all said , hailed porsche cast into total oblivion . all he then wants family ride sleigh . his lessons come hard , but he learns . again , one get past all commercialism really get meat this film , this film should get all accolades respected place all time-honored christmas films past . i love jonathan taylor thomas ; he good actor very handsome . but this not reason my customer review . unlike what other people may think or how they may view it , this one best christmas films teach what christmas really all	1

fervent desire often overlaps into soft-porn territory cinematic language carnal images aughties , extent old-fashioned romantic some us yearns timeless gems such " philadelphia story , " " casablanca , " " charade " " indiscreet . " these films , among others , remind us courtship necessity modern times . this reviewer nary word against adult nudity film -- , when it handled artistically sans embarrassment many european films . however , more offensive than today shock stock inane romantic comedies early 21st century made directors/auteurs who believe casting attractive actors precludes translating their fertile imaginations plausible , well-plotted scripts . while admittedly not perfect film , stanley donen " indiscreet " ( 1958 ) , starring cary grant ingrid bergman , realistically captures first blush courtship two middle-aged adults -- one prudent other deceptive -- charts their reluctant romance . sure , camera loves grant bergman , but it their fine acting combined clever dialogue sculpts " indiscreet " into classic . too many scenes count " indiscreet , " philip adams ( grant ) anna kalman ( bergman ) stare longingly into each other eyes searing intensity surpasses mere consummation love affair . example , breakfast nook scene anna london apartment , philip allows his meal grow cold while watching anna prepare hers stove . ( " it servants ' day off " her seductive phone invite earlier morning . ) his dining chair , he practically burns hole through his paramour apron . one bergman best lines spoken table : " stop . good manners spoil good food , " she quips . once seated , she too finds it nearly impossible eat because her suitor drinking her gaze . more than once they sip their tea , pause stare each other , then resume sipping . where subtle expressions courtship -- furtive glances , tender kisses sexual innuendos -- mature man mature woman ? unfolding screen " indiscreet , " certain . how memorable nighttime tableaux detailing first date vulnerable london-based stage actress arrogant american diplomat ! after overindulging champagne private club where anna brother-in-law , alfred , member , they arrive too late attend ballet performance romeo juliet decide give anna tickets two teens . here where grant delivers one most understated lines movie : " i know how story ends -- bad . " ( comment , not simply reference shakespearean drama , could meant social statement conservative adults ' opposition young love 1950s america -- i.e. waltz vs . rock ' roll . ) rather than evening end failed note , anna philip return club more libation laughter topped off late-night stroll past london monuments , while anna chauffeur few her fans trail them . final scene anna philip first night courtship exemplifies how erotic fire handled subtly " indiscreet . " ( course , there enough sexual tension violins alone . ) pair share banter nightcap before disappearing into anna apartment shutting door . when camera zooms out shot closed door , visual effect erotic impact more telling than " not disturb " sign hanging doorknob outside honeymoon suite . stark contrast , many " " -rated flicks today nothing but prurient lessons heavy-handed debauchery . gone ethereal gazes , graceful kisses balletic gestures yesteryear . unlike light dalliance observed " indiscreet , " even today so called " pg-13 " flicks opt overt , gratuitous scenes lingerie shedding naughty/scatological word lashing no transcendent significance . even bertolucci films " last tango paris " " sheltering sky " treat scenes nudity sex moving sculptures paintings , reserve curse words existential statements . while i not seek metaphysical meaning " indiscreet " other films like ilk , i expect great romance gorgeous film score . who knows ? bard himself might approve -- absence ill-fated lovers notwithstanding	1

i saw this movie maybe five years ago . i found myself thinking back it oddest times without apparent reason . it happened again me today , i decided look amazon see if there any insightful reviews offering opinions why this movie still compels me . i surprised discover praise this movie hard find wmd iraq . fact , if you rewrote bad reviews keeping all their points intact , but changed conclusions read , " this why i liked it " , you'd right track finding film strengths . i say right track because what film ultimately gives life something greater than its many parts . it yields haunting compelling image loss , dissolution , madness , glimpses redemption only highlight how far past saving these characters . i think this movie , i remember emotions , mood it , way smell your childhood bring long forgotten memories back	1

just enjoyed quiet brilliance yasujiro ozu " tokyo monogatari ( tokyo story ) " first time last week , i immediately drawn ozu film released criterion collection last year , 1951 " bakushu ( early summer ) " . both movies part his classic noriko trilogy which uses many same actors playing characters same names but different roles . consequently , great setsuko hara portrays young woman named noriko both movies , but this time , she liberated daughter ( rather than forlorn daughter-in-law ) also focal point story ( rather than aged parents " tokyo story " ) . musical chairs continue chishu ryu playing his real age noriko strong-willed brother koichi ( rather than resigned grandfather ) haruko sugimura playing older neighbor tomi , mother noriko prospective fiancee ( versus conniving daughter shige ) . chieko higashiyama still plays grandmother , but her name not tomi but shige , her husband shukishi portrayed ichiro sugai . it only confusing if you looking some kind plot continuity films , but ozu primarily interested reinforcing similar themes evolving family unit post-wwii japan . this time , he it more comic , sometimes even ribald fashion , while it doesn't resonate quite deeply " tokyo story " , " early summer " full ozu shrewd observations insights make it emotionally affecting , especially story takes surprise turn toward end . story here centers mamiya family , who trying find suitable husband 28-year old single daughter noriko . typical japanese culture , several generations live together under one roof , frequent subject conversation noriko lack husband . however , she member new postwar breed japanese women . she dresses almost exclusively western clothes holds down administrative position office heart tokyo . spirit , noriko bears strong resemblance elizabeth bennett jane austen " pride prejudice " , point raised film historian donald richie his informative commentary . she loves go dinner her girlfriends . four friends , two married two unmarried . particularly amusing scene , four spirited debate pros cons married life versus single life . noriko happy her life it doesn't seem too concerned changing it anytime soon . nonetheless , family attempts fix noriko up successful , 40-year old business associate her boss . although polite matchmaking effort , she becomes more interested her neighbor , old classmate now widowed left alone small daughter his mother . noriko prefers her potential husband old friend they slip into their new romantic relationship more easily than two complete strangers . bigger problem , though , she makes her decision without consulting her family that where familial conflict arises . hara continues revelation me , beautiful , charismatic actress who radiates goodness sense cunning mischief entrancing . supporting performances excellent sugimura again standout surprising turn mother grateful noriko her decision marry her son kenkichi . kuniko miyake bigger , more dimensional role here than " tokyo story " , playing yet again brother wife fumiko . she hara particularly lovely scene beach end film , two pretty funny scene where they hide their clandestine cake slices somnambulant child . chikage awashima portrays noriko best friend aya feisty charm , goading noriko see man she passed up , impersonating country bumpkin preview noriko new married life trading innuendo-heavy barbs noriko politically incorrect boss . this latter interchange surprisingly adult 1951 , they even joke noriko may lesbian waiting so long get married . children play more prominent roles here , ozu really plays up their bratty insubordination they hurl inappropriate epithets when they don't get their way , though their running away home catalyst noriko become attracted kenkichi . yuuharu atsuta provides beautiful cinematography , which gratefully captured fairly pristine print film , though i believe ozu one most responsible simple yet powerful scene compositions . his now familiar low-to-the ground camera angles used consistently film replicate perspective someone sitting tatami mat . lighter more loosely structured than " tokyo story " , " early summer " essential viewing ozu aficionados anyone interested post-wwii japanese society . richie thorough commentary , dvd package also includes 47-minute documentary , " ozu films behind scenes " , which includes table discussion ozu longtime cameraman takashi kawamata , his sound editing assistant kojiro suematsu producer shizuo yamanouchi who produced six ozu films	1

make no mistake ; " chato land " sprawling , unforgiving environment offers little water no reward . blistering , sprawling landscape rock sagebrush , however , but backdrop this story shows man his most ugly moments . charles bronson stars pardon chato , half apache indian who enjoying drink saloon when he antagonized arrogant sheriff . chato goes against sheriff wishes leave because his heritage , lets his actions speak themselves , leaving mouthy lawman dead floorboards . posse soon rounded up variety area men , many them farmers ranchers . they embark trip find chato avenge death town , well feed some their own continual hatred towards indians general . greed , hate perseverance battle logic , pride tolerance group soon start battling each other over what they think right wrong when it comes avenging death lawman . great western film 1971 , chato land offers solid stoic storyline wrought irony well themes loyalty revenge . charles bronson aside , superb supporting cast experienced well . victor french ( later " little house " " highway heaven " stardom ) graces screen one posse members , jack palance james whitmore tow , its well rounded cast never lacks quality acting despite somewhat linear storyline . palance plays part quincy whitmore , war veteran who understands , sometimes even respects apache actions more than most . his arch-nemesis jubal hooker ( played simon oakland ) who " fever " wanting see apache man hang , even if it costs them lives which could end up coming down last man . jubal excellently played oakland man who consumed his own destiny vengeance . loyalties loved lost , large part movie very emotional power prestige we experience dismay men they deal battles rage within their very own camp , minds . bronson portraying cunning , intelligent yes even ruthless apache warrior , chato land western filled buzzards drinking blood , dark side man , notion if you go battle someone their own back yard , you better think twice who best odds , regardless how many men you bring you . scenic landscape shots taken night well during scorching hot days excellent , sound quality this dvd my opinion very good if not perfect . if you want western gets dirty but portrays deep story within , see " chato land "	1
very good , but first part , it left me questioning their sources how accurate their stories indian civiizations before white man came . how they know so much able reconstruct their towns computer graphics . it made me wonder if i fed bologne or not . i questioning myself through out whole thing . how they know so much how they know exactly what happened what things looked like ? how they know so much ?? i mean this hundreds years before white man came . i think documentary very good well worth watch . i just could not get over first part , how they know so much indians ancient history how they lived what their ancient towns looked like . it just seemed little overly speculative all . next big question how could this complete documentary american indians without talking destruction inca empire peru . talking more indian tribes south america ?	1

this movie combination baseball love story rings true . i not like schmaltz all , but costner kelly preston true connection . story very much filmed within modern moral code , yet eventual reality " you don't know what you ' til you lose it " beautifully portrayed both actors . baseball segments exceptionally well . costner beyond realistic major league pitcher . very underrated movie , maybe evidenced its extensive play pay networks now , 7 years after it theater run . sountrack doesn't hurt either .	1

one first great ealing comedies , clear indication their comedies would carry social political weight well . this picture run-down section london discovers horde burried treasure when bomb left over ww ii explodes accidentally , residents pimlico , london , learn they actually part burgandy , deeded king 1400s . this means they separate country right heart london , they decide act like separate country . thus they conclude laws england don't apply anymore - but likewise england cuts them off , pimlico under siege . craziness situation leapfrogs , passports now required , services cut , people throwing food over barbed-wire fence help them survive . it great satire government sovereignty . it also interesting look post-war london , its burned-out buildings still plentiful ration books still use ( england felt very much short end stick after war , last allied countries under wartime restrictions shortages ) . script terrific ( typical ealing productions ) , stanley holloway wonderful leader pimlico . definitely worth watch	1
very funny but some jokes same . bill alsome not repeat his jokes	1
alan arkin ( like george lazenby james bond franchise ) only got it once , but his interpretation inspector clouseau , he pulls it off memorably . one things makes this movie so good arkin clouseau organic movie so movie clips decent pace . sometimes peter sellers , everything came stop so we could watch him trip twitch put his foot into buckets unsuccessfully try out costumes ... until it felt like movie ran ten twenty minutes too long . peter sellers could very funny , but sometimes gag could tedious . ' revenge pink panther ' my favorite sellers entries because it felt like editor employed . -- thing makes arkin clouseau so much fun he actually seems little smarter than sellers clouseau . what makes sellers funny he both stupid supremely arrogant . we don't necessarily like him , but he funny . arkin , you actually end up liking guy . there sympathetic core him this partly due fact he isn't all stupid . he moments personal insight ( like when he rips up his autographed sean connery picture because he doesn't deserve it ) it makes clouseau interesting . -- arkin smart here . he doesn't try peter sellers . this isn't imitation . it may not even interpretation . what arkin work funny smart script , wonderful locales team ( like lazenby bond ) who bent over backwards bring out clouseau movie doesn't original clouseau . what it amounts funny ( times , hilarious ) movie shines pink panter franchise . this movie isn't just curiousity . it terrific comedy that worth look	1

great jean gabin world weary , elegant , elder crime king pin max jacques becker understated 1954 touchez pas au grisbi ( criterion ) . title literally translates " hands off my loot !

wow this movie eye opener . after watching it i believe almost any conspiracy theory , because they all sound more reasonable than truth government atomic testing programs . back then people told mny forms radiation bounce harmlessly off human skin ! hosts kid tv shows talked bomb shelter preparedness ! no wonder everyone went nuts 60 . it backlash against all " atomic war " talk . children regularily reminded classs a-bomb could hit any time . hmm explains alot boomers . you probably already know this movie collection propaganda films shown america calm fears public over nuclear war . it brilliantly edited . hope makers long prolific career . some it very funny when you look back attitudes time . there great part where nixon appears variety show nikita kruschev , nikita makes dick look pretty shabby they attempt one up each other aamerican national tv . when you lack people skills even hard line communist premiere then you know you're trouble . ah dick , you should learned . most important message i got this film gov't needs watched very closely ensure its honesty . there too many agendas floating around washington don't public best interest mind . don't accept anything spoon fed you because it probably load crap . except irradiated food , i'm sure gov't wouldn't let happen if it wasn't safe . not !	1

finding nemo probably one best movies ever produced pixar walt disney . it hit theaters , also hit dvd release . this two-disc set features same movie original theatrical release , plus lots extra features . there extra scenes deleted scenes , but these mainly sketches hence not included part regular movie . movie itself worth buying this set ; its bright flashy cool visuals special effects make it attractive kids . soundtrack considerably different traditional classical fair found disney motion length pictures . this movie soundtrack laid back different , but paces well action . voice-overs great , comedy unique hilarious . vegetarian sharks ! fish without memory ! disney takes family entertainment new heights this great movie , i highly recommend it	1
this adaptation fairy tale " little red riding hood " not children.it got couple good transformations , not best i've seen but good nonetheless . i'd imagine kids would find this scary it not bad adults either . i doubt this film would made these days 80 able get away much more , unless great terry gilliam helm . i loved set designs , all little creatures way wolves used all very well done.as i said , not something i would show my 8 year old daughter fear it causing her nightmares but would definitely recommend this teens adults . good horror film those who don't need axe-wielding murderers able enjoy more fantasy right	1

i saw this sometime back 2001 , i believe . friend mine bought it vhs dollar some bargain bin somewhere . huge fan heavy music rock over past 20+ years , this movie opened my eyes whole new scene like nothing ever before . course i fan nirvana , aic soundgarden early mid 90 , but this film exposes you origins all . little independant research , you then find all sorts gems bands albums you might truly enjoy . mudhoney , supersuckers murder city devils three my favorite bands i first sought them out direct result watching " hype " then doing my own investigating there . it won't steer you wrong . what up new cover though ? used black white stage diving scene red letters .	1
this series sold missing episodes , like many others here unbox . they think their customers so dumb ? would you buy dvd series missing dvd ? what sense this make ? what disappointment this service ..	-1
this certainly one best atlantis shows date . one common ground .	1
this one most beautiful delectably edited movies i've ever seen . actors know their roles wholeheartedly . my guess they classically-trained theatre actors . chunhyang one korea 5 stories told oral tradition , originally adults . pansori , if you've ever taken class or tried it , very difficult . requires power diaphragm vocal range . once , there 7 us class , all together , power our voices could not top sole instructor . im kwon-taek smart incorporate pansori . those you who dont know , there no chunhyang tale without pansori , so it absolutely necessary this movie . " chunhyang-ga " balladeer jo sang-hyeon , also known national intangible asset #5 . my dvd said it japanese . someone should fired not fact-checking . also , it nothing like raise red lantern or zhang yimou . but westerners need write make it relative their prior movie experience . chunhyang beautiful story poetry honor meditation . it love fidelity .	1

i've seen one other film federico fellini ( it 8 1/2 ) i saw half " la dolce vita . " i know what his films like , so when i watched " la strada " i surprised what i saw . this film completely unlike aforementioned films , therefore , probably fellini most accessible film . it movie shades much earlier american film called " broken blossoms " but sound new storyline , fellini made poignant , cute , sad little film . i didn't even realize how much i liked this film until it over . fellini wife giulietta masina plays gelsomina , young girl who bought her family zampano ( anthony quinn ) , strongman . he travels around country her , all while brutally mean her , they eventually end up traveling circus where gelsomina meets fool ( richard basehart ) , much nicer , tender man who advises her leave zampano . what perfect name this character ; fool . his decisions foolish end , his fate fool . ending film truly fantastic , very well acted moment . " la strada " seems take direct inspiration several things . storyline inspired " broken blossoms " character gelsomina seems inspired tramp , character created charlie chaplin . she half-wit , not very pretty , seems hate zampano . yet everytime she given opportunity escape , she declines . this movie made during heyday italian neo-realism fellini went against convention casting two american actors film ( both actors dubbed soundtrack english , available this dvd . i recommend you watch italian film though , because dubbed fellini film ruins magic ) . probably most inspired casting decision film masina . i'm not very fond when director work their wives , because wife usually movie solely because she wife ( see guy ritchie remake " swept away " proof ) . i can't imagine actress portraying gelsomina . she brings just right amount sadness , innocence , playfulness character . even if you're not fond fellini ( although , if you're reading this , you probably ) i recommend you see this film it completely different mood feel it than his other films . even if you don't particularly want see movie , you think it seeing little piece history ( this film first win best foreign language film academy awards ) . criterion collection superb , flawless transfer dvd . grade :	1
someone just today told me i should see this film . what disappointment see these warnings poor quality dvds produced fox lorber . oh well	-1
great movie . date best version out there . 2 disc ! it great watching it commentary fans . this just awesome . colour widescreem format surperb . many special features including commentaries , interviews , trailers etc . scramble city episode which special feature , which i looking forward fell below expectations due fact you could only watch it commentary . only four toy commercials . there easter eggs both discs ( old diaclone toy commercials ) . overall great addition my dvd collection fully recommended	1
reviewer who cannot stand steven spielbergs'over sentimentalized trashing history ; his inability tell story without shoving it your face ; i loved this movie . beginning end it moving well told . slice history needs telling . incredible performances , especially john malkovich . it treats japanese respect yet not any way diminish their brutality ww2 . inspiring film ! only other film spielberg ever come close this one schindlers list . must film see	1
i just watched " mommie dearest " first time tonight . most critics fans " mommie dearest " acknowledge , film portrays such pitiful story abuse , such over-dramatic ( but entirely true-to-life ) performance faye dunaway , it both hilarious depressing . i'm 30 didn't know much joan crawford outside endless chatter film " classic camp . " seems me crawford probably bi-polar or some other unexplained mental disorder . i think she quite aware some insanity she lived caused movie industry she dedicated . she knew industry poisoned any good thing she endeavored , whether it successful marriage , happy family , or even giving charity . her life running commercial directed hollywood , not unlike tabloid-driven , image-obsessed hollywood we today . despite often-times hilarious image her her sibling victimization film , christina abuse disappointment her mother real painful some point her life . christina crawford completely justified turning her mother image its head her book movie . yes , movie outrageous but it also empowering . after all , what powerless their pitiful past except laugh . mocking unexplained , unjustified pain you experienced past , renders it powerless harm your future . this legacy " mommie dearest " whatever joan crawford really	1
leaving aside painful horrific real life incident taints movie moment , lets just look movie it . first off , i love horror movies , some my faveorites even include ones considered " bad " tons movie critics , like first 4 ' friday 13th ' movies . i love most nightmare elm street movies , first 2 halloween movies , tons others , inlcuding , yes , victor salva own ' jeepers creepers ' , whcih i think best horror movie come out last 5 years . but clownhouse just laughable annoying terribly acted . bickering among 3 brothers driving me nuts one . characters so many amazingly stupid things cliches horror movies , they them often , more so than even dumbest horror movies . peple here already noted very cheesy music takes away whatever creepiness there . movie just plain boring . killings all dull lifeless . there just didnt seem any reason this movie exist , i mean its barely 80 minutes long ! incredibly short any movie , even horror movie , which usually around 90 minutes-plus or minus few . movie very lazy explaining who killers , we get very little info them , why they mental patients , one-what they ? i mean what their method killing or why they dangerous . now they loose , what they want ? money ? they just wanna kill ? isn't it strange they don't talk all ? some people actually compared this greatest horror movie them all , john carpenter halloween , now thats truley scary thought . movie also incredibly predictable took incredibly long time finally kids realize killer clowns house gonna kill them , even when action finally starts , its all too unbeleivable silly beleive . unfortuneatley , i rather disturbing sinister thought why this " horror " movie , which almost doesnt even feel like real horror movie me , anyway , might made . apparently , victor salva , director molesting young child star film , nathan forrest winters , years since he age 7 , they previously worked victor salva first film , short film , some years earlier . perhaps this whole movie making enterprise endeavered just so victor could even more close proximity boy so he could molest him even more . perhaps why victor made film . its ironic this movie evil clowns , because clown someone usually makes kids happy , kid actually line why clowns fake shouldnt trusted . its all so weird , like victor trying get himself caught ? there so much incriminating visuals dialogue this film just doesnt belong horror movie , but well brings mind kiddie porn . apparently victor also friend kids family years . this movie almost like victor bragging his molestation boy , using his camera storytelling skills shove everyone faces his relationship boy . \ there some strange back story film never really explained alludes mental illness , boy may suicidal tried off himself cutting his hand or perhaps wrist . its said he " scars " there . also boy may committed , just like escaped killer clowns ? salva drawing parallel there ? why child wet bed such advanced age , whats his problem anyway ? its never said , but perhaps salva hinting hes gay , who knows . its interesting killers dont just escape out jail , they excape mental facility perhaps they really just sick individuals , just like boy ? victor salva trying say he boy actor film both share something others may say sick but they belong together ? they say child molestors search out young boys who they think homosexual , who one them . clowns drawn boy , yet its also always boy who see them , almost like hes looking them like they both drawn each other . i dont know why this film made , so if my theories rub some here wrong way , i am sorry , i just cant figure out why someone who would show talent later horror movies like jeepers creepers , would make such pointless awful strange horror movie , if not his own perverted pleasure . definitely miss this flick , dont fooled all surprisingly positive reviews here . this movie sucks	-1

corky introvert who not relate very well people , so he learns express himself through use if his alter ego , fats dummy . turns out people love fats , association , corky . certainly corky must realize people understand fats corky same , right ? perhaps not , corky relies increasingly more fats say what he himself could easily , if only he confidence so . fats brings corky fame fortune , but we all know money cannot buy happiness . turns out corky fame just solution his childhood romance , peggy ann snow , whose wanderlust not satisfied husband duke rooted , staid life . loser-turned-celeb corky what it takes sweep once popular peggy off her feet take her away it all ? anthony hopkins gives chilling performance corky / fats , burgess meredith shines , always , corky agent , ben greene . ann-margret some very good moment peggy , though ultimately her performance uneven . very good film	1

i skeptical this film expected disappointed , but contrary , i pleasantly surprised . essential thing remember this maurice pialat * vision * van gogh , not documentary . taken spirit , there much here vincent fans enjoy . those unfamiliar van gogh life work likely lost ( probably bored ) , but those who familiar vincent his oeuvre appreciate research pialat put into this film artistic choices he made . i also encourage viewers who may felt they missed something first time watch it second time , because there many small things best noticed second time round . one detail i particularly appreciated replication van gogh actual room auberge ravoux auvers-sur-oise this film ( not case " lust life " or " vincent theo " ) ; those who visited auberge moved their experience -- like myself -- feel surge recognition first time humble little room appears onscreen . course there some major inaccuracies/speculations pialat uses fuel drama . most obvious central love affair film ( marguerite gachet ) , which pialat invention most implausible number reasons . but it serves its purpose context film . i not get impression ( one reviewer below ) affair presented motive suicide--it not . suicide affair both result larger malaise . jacques dutronc simply extraordinary vincent , his acting filled subtlety . he doesn't stoop histrionics or scenery-chewing ... he doesn't need . every gesture , every facial expression , every look his eyes says something character . no wonder he won cesar role . this neither vincent " lust life " ( kirk douglas ' tormented soul searching love understanding ) nor vincent " vincent theo " ( tim roth mad-as-a-hatter egoist ) . this vincent quiet cup coffee before he goes work morning escapes dr. gachet house enjoy solitary lunch wheatfields ( latter one my favorite moments film -- simple but lyrical ) . there no sign " mad artist " van gogh mythology . suicide comes much surprise film it must real life . we don't see it coming . apparently there region 2 dvd available uk deleted scenes bonus materials . i wish it available region 1 dvd us !	1

amazingly , 3 8 reviewers ( myself included ) related tilghman .... which says more hollywood than descendants this great man . there so much material his life base movies it simply hasn't some reason . i found this movie wonderful if only let world know tilghman even existed .. his death important event so i'm glad it portrayed . acting well general casting great . wiley lynn character first seems over top but if you familiar man you realize this very accurate portrayal . lynne eventually brought down hail lead but not after taking down beloved man . i some problems accuracy film though ... if you've ever chandler , oklahoma you won't see huge mountains distance , tilghman never rode his horse chandler cromwell .. he loved his car . i love sam elliot ( he great job ) but he just not 70+ year old man . i wish older children ( his frist marriage ) shown funeral multiple memorial services he given could mentioned . other than i highly recommend this film	1
truly one most off wall movies ever . john cusack girlfriend dumps him . this would pretty hard most people except he literally thousands pictures up her . everything this movie extreme . cusack sicko best friend amazingly funny watch , sure see him snort snow wonderul scene . cusack girlfriend new preppy boyfriend who head ski team . cusack decides defeat him . there way too much talk there no way i could give anythign away one funniest movies ever . i mean you chinese guy who learned english listening howard cosell forces cusack race cars everyday while announcing race his car , insane paper boy who wants his $2 , you never see van halen same way again . cause everybody wants some , baby how bout you ? obviously it goes without saying this movie needs special edition .	1

i don't know why anyone gives this film less than five star rating top it praise budd boetichher westerns . though boeticher films great , i find pre-boetciher-scott westerns best there more traditional less talky grim than boeticher westerns . ten wanted men no exception ; it fast paced , well-plotted plenty intense action keep your eyes peeled . definately one scott best . sometimes i find scott-boeticher westerns , there too much talking walking around some pretentious talk drag film down	1
my humble opinion , woody allen best movie director that currently out there practicing trade . he says more , amuses more , creates more relatively " shoestring " budget than any other director today . his popularity apparently rather limited point his movies usually don't even get shown my town . allen films get praised lot people " know " but , come oscar time , only award handed out his productions goes best supporting actress . well , each his own but i'll recommend every movie he ever involved ( lone exception " what new pussycat ? " ) ; even ones i haven't seen yet . last night i got my first look " purple rose cairo " i ended up rating it " 4 star " mainly because i thought it moved rather awkwardly times ( woody allen standards ) . concept certainly original ; actor movie steps out screen into real life ( seems they're watching us closely we're watching them ) . i started seeing all sorts possibilities , i admit , i disappointed some them didn't emerge . what emerge excellent study fantasy vs . reality . setting film midst depression which brilliant idea because it gave readily understood backdrop gloom doom . anyone would love escape such existance . our main character , played mia farrow , finds her escape movie theatre . strange events unfold , she finds herself ultimately choose fantasy reality we , audience , find ourselves rooting one choice or other . ( even exasperated screen characters cheering sides well ) . end she makes her choice live consequences ... or she ? i saw this movie tcm night they celebrating van johnson . i presumed " late " mr. johnson would somehow shown one his old sceen roles . however , there he fairly small part looking well doing credible job . i learned , robert osborne introduction film , it still little early call van johnson " late " . much cast competent good top kudos ms. farrow . ending movie strong i almost tempted give it " 5 star " rating but i remembered i significantly more impressed some other woody allen movies i've seen lately .	1
i found this movie very funny . everyone knows it isn't goal really important , it journey there what very funny this movie . it changes " nerd " taking chances stealing van finally standing up his father i found most vindicating . it also changes guys girlfriend he getting tape how thier relationship changed too . what very funny physics student making calculation speed car so they get across washed out bringe . i recommend unrated version this movie anyone good laugh movie .	1

i whole heartedly disagree amazon editorial . first it says this film unintentionally funny . it isn't . then it says one two heroines film gets killed her husband . she doesn't . if amazon insists trying write witty synopsis its films , i would suggest staff writer first view film . this film tradition valley dolls spite misleading ' professional ' reviews it crowd pleaser . material originates steamy bestseller , big budget top notch production - all like dolls . you see money screen beautiful locations amazing wardrobe jewels all gorgeously photographed . film like book juicy soap opera should enjoyed such . acting very good all especially marie-france pisier who throughout entire film never loses viewer understanding her motives even when end film she completely lost herself . five stars amazon , you don't agree , just accurate	1
why this my favorite movie ? because it simply presents life , all its joys , griefs , paradoxes mysteries . what puts this movie class itself spirit hope runs through movie , especially main character , ingmar , whose indomitable spirit shines face change tragedy . yet movie never drifts into sentimentality . end , it movie mystery love . central theme ingmar " life dog . " like dog shot into space soviet without regard its safe return earth , ingmar , like most us , seems " shot into life " alone . movie series vignettes combine what seems haphazard manner , but reflects , my mind , most meaningful transcendant moments our lives , moments simply cannot categorized . these moments funny , sad , tragic , hopeful , above all , poignant . scene where ingmar boxes his tomboy friend , ending embrace , defies words its sublimity . scene which ingmar mother breaks down , absolutely heartbreaking . wistful scenes ingmar " marriage " neighbor girl , his brother description intercourse neighborhood children , remind you revelations youth . but there insights into adulthood well , happy-go-lucky uncle , his happy but impish bride , contrast prim glum foster parents , perverted modern artist , man who perpetually fixing his roof . end , you'll celebrating sweden , ingmar ( get it ? ) johanson triumphs over floyd patterson . hurrah sweden ! hurrah humanity !	1

i've never watched any shows regularly fx until this year , when i happened catch double episode it always sunny philadelphia , 3 episodes into season 2 . i don't remember when i've laughed so hard past few years . this show hysterical ! charlie day , what i say ? i dare say he funniest character television . case point , episode : hundred dollar baby . gang walking home evening ( charlie , mac , dennis dee ) when apparent meth head tries mug them . charlie mac dennis all run away , knocking down dee fend herself ( intentionally or non-intentionally ? you decide . ) . dee gets mugged decides she going take some kind " box-er-cizing " thing learn how defend herself , but her dad frank , played danny devito , pipes up says if she wants learn defend herself she should learn him , he former boxer ( " frankie fast hands " ) . she agrees . meantime , dennis mac convince charlie become underground street fighter after attending one realizing " all you really need able take worse beating than other guy . " mac asks dennis " you know who take beating ? " they both instantly turn each other say " charlie .

" i think he captures factual basis spirit this film . i understand how some who " australia-philes " might want see purely aussie product , this not . it not " smash palace " or many other fine aussie films genre . what this film , described one word : weird . that good thing . genius eric roberts used ( may still again ) , his ability seemingly lose himself his roles , so while lacking any self-consciousness how he comes across . see this film then see other excellent ( weird ) films , including " pope greenwich village " " runaway train , " see career arc pretty amazing . he seemed get into serious films major talent around him , then able carry-off demanding roles ( albeit , some similar , sure ) , energy command . okay , onto this film . first all , let honest , this not deep film . it not meant . it almost like indie verson farrely brothers film , least their early ones , where they don't mind taking risks also fun . there also nice romantic subtext they ( " kingpin " - believe it or not , " me , myself irene " ) where , ridiculous way , they reflect what good majority people who either searching love , or just searching something themselves , they find it reflected or - case main characters farrely films , definitely " coca cola kid , " abbetted others . i'm not saying woody harrelson or jim carrey could've coca cola kid , but what they all common , specific roles they played these films , make one wonder if anyone would or could find anything remotely interesting them romantic way . they so completely un-indearing , it seems almost cartoonish - then one just thinks many people we all know , it not unbelieavable . music film alone just fantastic . coca cola jingle robert character commissions incredible , it punctuated this aboriginal guy who playing his device - guy roberts finds outside coca cola local offices , promptly drafts into service . it just really funny see kid mind work - marketing wheels a'spinnin ' he devises employs his strategies . everyone both sides equally mocked , makes really fine , mostly non-judgemental film ( rare these days , eh ? ) . there other nice touches soundtrack andalso , i'd remiss , not mention nuts , if i avoided very nice scene greta scaatchi where she freshening up ... well , go see film ! it quirky , it revealing , lot fun . it also great job discussing culture clashes , where , when everyone harmless , you see how progress comes out some dissension , yet still wonder if we're losing little something translation . if that vague , so film some ways , i think precisely what director going . it doesn't all fit perfectly . lot doesn't , makes it kind seem real	1
i liked first two spy kids movies pretty well . first one well acting great . second one , maybe bit less than first but still entertaining . this movie , however , incredibly lame absolutely boring . my brother went see it my mom theaters , some reason they came back saying it soooo good . when it came out dvd i watched it my brother . only twenty minutes into it i wishing i could leave . all " amazing " 3-d , computer animated sequences giving me terriblel headaches i no reason whatsoever watch this drivel . previous reviewer said , spy kids series lost its charm after second installment . this movie they trying go out bang , but fell miles short finish line . acting seemed stale unemotional . humor lame not even funny . whole things seemed like weird dream director thought might make decent movie . overall , it seems me this just one mega test even worse flop " adventures sharkboy lavagirl " . i no appreciation this director any more unless he gives us something good fast , i probably won't watching anymore his films any time soon	-1
although not fan kenneth brannaugh , i willing give his hamlet fair viewing . since this my favorite play , i hoping film would better than his last two mediocre endeavors into shakespeare plays ; unfortunately , it worse ! beginning performances : jack lemmon wonderful actor , but here , he embarrassment , many other actors assembled , including julie christie ( whom i usually adore ) . casting all over map which makes uneven performances unsatisfying scenes . brannaugh own delivery text rushed usually unconvincing , despite vehemence which he delivers every over-ennunciated syllable , which sounds manic , bordering farce . bad direction over-indulgent acting ! it might interesting see what brannaugh would good direction , instead his own . i could go my problems staging other production values but damage this brilliant work every level not worth going depth . good news zefferelli hamlet , actor i don't normally like -- mel gibson -- spot perfect . actor excellently cast , production values direction serve text , rather than competing it , brannaugh version . zefferelli knows his shakespeare his films , my opinion represent definitive versions ( watch his romeo juliet taming shrew ) , too bad us he didn't more . too bad , also , no one contemporary seems capable . instead we get recent unwatchable junk " hip-cool " sensibilities . argh ! it not surprising no one rush produce dvd this tragedy film	-1

i love this movie , i grew up chuck jones ' kipling series i love it better than disny which just too long , his short left me wanting more . when i like 5 i saw riki-tiki-tavi first time my aunt houe , even though i am deathly terrified snakes , i loved this movie . my parents spent like $50 renting this movie blockbuster then finnaly it came nickalodean we recorded it . after time , it wore out , we couldnt watch it . when i 7th grade my teacher mentioned we studying kipling i got excited when she told us we watch riki-tiki-tavi . 7 years ago , now i'm 20 . .... this day i recite movie memory , ( which cmes handy my theater class ) characters memorable fantastic nag nagaina still creepy ever ! i recomend children need see these works art ( white seal , mowglii brothers )	1
ok , i saw this movie years ago when it first came out i rented it vhs dvd few times , still don't own it yet . this good friday 13th movie , but best thing this movie way they brought jason back file . you tommy jarvis now around 18-19 years old losing his hair , he escapes mental institution his side kick ( arnold horshack ? ) anyway , he goes cemetary rainy night dig up jason face his past once all . but after opening coffin seeing jason dead body he goes crazy ( obviously not taking his meds ) pulls metal pole cemetary fence starts stabbing jason while dead man still coffin . after calming down he throws jason mask down grave gives jason few choice words . all sudden lightening strikes pole while it stuck jason body . rest they say history . jason comes back life goes work . these movies so subjective , i loved it one best , last " real " friday 13th movie . but i would rent it see what you think before you buy it . i own parts 2-5 all good films , part ii probably best . i need part one , part six then my collection complete , nothing after part six important . part 8 funny watch , but not worth buying , but ending really good though	1

wow some people take children movies too seriously . i own harriet spy i still love it same since it came out i think it nick classic . if you think it its shame new generation kids grow up without movies like this . harriet spy few things it seem like its not children but if you pay attention watch it end it also teaches you appreciate what you plenty other good morals . movie description bit simple complicated same time its 11 yr old wants writer but her spying her writing actually its more like shes exploring writing everything she sees . you cant just read reviews movie you see it cause some reviews dont this great movie any justice . acting great story line very original thought provoking . if your parent you would like know if this good movie your kids well im tellin you it . i 8 when it came out it made me look some things differently . this great movie you shouldn't let your kids miss this this definitely teach children appreciate good friends more important good parents . i'm sorry if this review doesn't help or give good movie description but this very underrated movie leave good impression kids not bad one	1
i think this movie goes right heart philosophical question what art artists supposed : they merely present facts/ideas/personalities/images no comment , no moralizing , no personal ulterior motives ( leaving all those things viewer ) , or they need state clearly moral purpose certain direction ( which viewer then accept or reject) ? martin sheen kit , garbageman working south dakota ; he becomes friends 15-year-old holly ( sissy spacek ) . when her father tells sheen he doesn't want him near his daughter again , sheen kills him . two run off together , living while woods like two " innocents " some primitive society . but then they're discovered three men sheen kills them , too . they now head montana , sheen committing more murders way . he empty inside , nothing fazes him ; he imagines he like james dean - misunderstood , alienated . but he doesn't clue what he should alienated against , far misunderstood , he never once gives least hint there anything there understand . we finish watching movie feeling empty sheen . i also felt little angry malick attempt con me into thinking there more sheen vapid character than there really : he truly just non-entity who kills half score innocent people . so back my first paragraph . malick obviously works perspective first half my question posed ( view became obsession , i think , artists , writers , film-makers , etc . beginning late 1960s ); i tend toward believing second half . suum cuique	1

i never saw marvel comics book so i knew absolutely nothing this character frank castle . i rented movie because i just love john travolta . thomas jane quite studly tough man here , but completely believable . he broods so handsomely throughout rest film . his character tormented deaths his family he out seek " punishment " not revenge he calls it . travolta fun sneering villian you tell he really enjoyed his role . he not out-right bad villian , but becomes so after death one his twin sons . yeah ladies , check out handsome actor playing his twin sons . plus , he got one beautiful but vindictive wife gorgeous laura harring . it shame her character not better developed more than stand around sexy outfits . it would fun see her more actively involved hunting down castle . overall , i enjoyed film great action film	1

contentwise , i won't toss darts or roses . this genre stuff . you either like it or you don't . my beef technical quality . it execrable . ( 1 ) it not widescreen ( cinemascope ) , which it ought biblical spectacular . there simply no excuse cranking out full-screen treatment dvd issued year 2000 . ( 2 ) so-called " digital remastering " must kitchen-table grade , because shapes fuzzy , colors oversaturated , visuals mushy . this dvd should withdrawn market new widescreen version substituted . i get better quality my vhs this movie than dvd i purchased . lousy lousy lousy , i said .	-1

i give this movie 5 stars sheer awfulness . notorious ed wood quot ; plan 9 outer spacequot ; may indeed worst movie ever made , but quot ; navy vs . night monstersquot ; good dark horse contender particular dishonor . imagine your uncle joe bob just retired navy , no directing or producing experience other than short documentary sock-washing other military hygiene issues , never seen science fiction or horror movie other than few minutes quot ; blobquot ; half one roger corman lesser works , suddenly found himself recruited direct feature-length flick , star mamie van doren or whatever other large-breasted bimbo could lured prospect some quick bucks . so he hires your cousin jim duane , not exactly known terribly successful or competent himself , writing special effects , ... need i go ? this movie hilariously , soaringly pewww-trid ! you'll scream ! you'll cry ! keep telling yourself : it only movie ... it only movie ..	1
giving you brief rundown where i stand , i thought part 1 pretty good ; part 2 some interesting things it ; i didn't much like part 3 ; part 4 started pick up pace again ; part 5 surprisingly good ; i think part 6 arguably best ; i didn't like part 7 . this 8th chapter little better than part 7 , but not saying much . story begins jason brought back life help electricity . ( this reuses technique part 6 , but it doesn't bring back same impact . ) jason claims his 1st 2 victims then makes his way boat full teenagers heading towards new york . here , story starts lose credibility . least part 6 made sense when he headed back crystal lake : " jason return area that familiar him . no matter what you call it , it still camp crystal lake him . " ( so , this 8th chapter , why jason go out his way board ship heading new york ? ) i know some people thought it interesting see jason aboard ship , it added something see jason potential victims trapped ship . i admit this valid defense movie , but my question : " why jason go out his way board this ship first place ? " moving , one jason possible victims fairly well developed character ( rennie ) who tragic past water , hallucinations jason . alright , i admit this one interesting thing . rennie uncle charles not exactly nicest person . ( but unlike dr. cruise part 7 , least charles some redeeming features . times , his concern rennie seems genuine ; when sean father killed , charles takes moment offer bit sympathy ; times , he concerned over safety others . ) interesting character sean ( son captain ) . he wants please his father , but feels he unable become captain his father . however , becoming captain his father wants him may only way save least few people ship . alright . redeeming feature . moving , there typical high body count , but 5 people manage escape new york city . unfortunately , they run into 2 thugs who rob them run off rennie . ( redeeming moment charles least he shows discretion trying rescue rennie . ) naturally , it isn't long before jason arrives new york city . problem i this movie : " why jason go out his way hunt down these 5 people whole city ? " least previous movies made sense . early part 2 we learn jason take revenge anyone who enters his territory again . parts 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , even 7 , least jason staying his own domain attacking anyone who happened there . sure , part 6 , jason attack some people away camp grounds , but least he his way back area familiar him . moving , there one other element i admit somewhat redeeming . we all know jason brutal killer , but one scene he portrayed almost heroic when he unwittingly saves rennie two thugs kidnapped her trying rape her . ( interesting twist i admit . ) i'll admit it comical when 2 last 5 people screamed help because they chased murderer , waitress could only say : " welcome new york . " course , typical friday 13th fashion , 2 people manage survive massacre come out alive . i'll admit this isn't worst friday 13th . ( honor shared parts 3 7 . ) i'll conclude saying this 8th chapter some redeeming moments , you may find it interesting twist . but you willing swallow some things aren't consistent rest series . if you're willing this , then you probably enjoy it more than i .	-1
this film should received more attention than it . scandinavia produced flood coming-of-age films during late 80s 90s , this far edgiest most intriguing . jan quot ;d evoquot ; kornstad -- outsider real life well -- stunning job mysterious clearly disturbed frank , who befriends otto during long , hot boring summer during late 60s . film wonderfully portrays downside scandinavian social-democratic idyll . if you enjoyed monika fagerholm novel , wonderful women sea , you'll also enjoy this film	1

i rented this movie because i really adore two lead actors . however , although they best they , there no saving this banal , movie week-esque movie . there couple nice moments , most notably when d'onofrio character talks his father his love football . other than , story seems cobbled together many other " uplifting " movies . times , you not only guess what happen next , but guess what exact line . football hero becomes self-pitying after accident leaves him blind ( unable satisfy his cheap girlfriend sack -- which she exposes tell-all book ) . his tutor school shows up , himself wheelchair , pops this crazy idea enter whitewater rafting race . even though he professes it all together all rah-rah , he still feels his own sadness his dreams dentist dashed drunk driver . but first -- you knew it ! -- they learn trust each other . this involves whacky stunts . two drive race , adventures , learning themselves each other , suprising locals can-do spirit . each scene seems end two sharing warm laugh fuzzy sunset . each person they run into nutty . even though i said i liked this , lines scene where olee talks his dad seem practically directly " breakfast club " where jock talks emotionally his dad . only commitment hines d'onofrio keep this one getting no stars all . so recap : person who cocky beloved his physical prowess loses it feels sorry himself ? check . person one last chance hear chanting crowd relive glory ? check . person who down same road self-pity redemption comes save him ? check . two men bond road endure colorful locals ? yup . student becomes teacher ? yes . locals try keep them down ? check . other dreamers lend hand ? drunk driving ? boy stunted emotionally father ? bathroom humor ? improbable competition set up prove worth outsiders , won stirring music cheers ? all those who've touched quest who we've met way show up end ? suprise ending supposed warm your heart teach you what really important ? yes , yes , yes	-1
american watching translation , it sometimes difficult determine film-maker intent . ever since " crouching tiger , hidden dragon , " we west re-evaluate martial arts cinema--it not always revenge . sometimes , it seems pretty inexplicable . you know -- different culture , different philosophy , etc . ( that what i'm told , anyway . since i don't speak chinese , i couldn't exactly say what gets lost translation . ) regardless culture or genre , big question always : you like movie ? well , yes , i liked it . i don't know if i get all it , but i liked it . action sequences special effects soundly executed without taking over film . actors enjoyable watch , i actually got jokes ( there many ) . end movie , i felt like i'd watched story , not just fluff . there theme hidden plot behind all those flying people swords . you gotta like .	1

... see just how bad it . unlike it predecessor heavy metal 2k one single 90 minute story arch talking place far future , using both hand drawn animation very bad cgi , bad even 2000 . basic plot miner named tyler ( michael ironsides ) stumbles across green glowing crystal literal key fountain youth . only draw back moment he touches it tyler goes completely bonkers starts killing lot people . " key " draws tyler settlement called eden , full people who haves traces life giving compound them , giving them healthy good looking looks , tyler probtly kills half population kidnaps rest , lone survivor raid julie ( julie strian ) begins blind quest revenge . everything could bad any given movie bad hm2k , dialog terrible , both written performed , camera work terrible , there no back story speak , tere loop holes even baby see , not even connection first firm loc-nar , which key suppose shard , except it green . also there not special features this dvd !!!!! i don't mind violence or nudity , fact i want see more western animation , but this movie just forgettable any other movie julie strian stars .	-1

my three rather " hip " sons ( 13 , 12 10 ) i watched glenn miller story together last week , somewhat my surprise ( theirs , i think ! ) , they loved it . brought back nice memories seeing it first time myself age . course , you jimmy stewart , june allyson harry morgan , special appearances likes louis armstrong , gene krupa frances langford . great family entertainment soundtrack good it gets . those looking true history channel-type documentary should know film takes artistic license liberties telling " story . " keeping mind this " hollywood " film , it quite enjoyable highly recommended	1
one level , this absurdist comic masterpiece other it scathing political satire parable . here you bunch firemen who one hand hopelessly stupid , incompetent corrupt , other hand they insufferably pompous , self-important , frauds --- film shows just how completely they muck up something so simple village dance , retirement party , lottery beauty paegeant , while completely failing their official capacity firemen same night . forman obvious target czech communist party late 1960s ; film immediately banned when soviet-led warsaw pact armies invaded czechoslovakia 1968 crush atempted " communism human face " reforms alexander dubcek while world stood watched , just it when hitler tanks rolled some 30 years earlier . result forman fled us where he continued illustrious filmmaking career . what interesting forman shot film location , tiny remote czech town using actual czech firemen villagers --- this lends unmistakably authentic quality whole film . dvd version colored , but original black white . there excellent special feature interview forman speaking his experience making film afterwards , well brief feature his cinematographer who oversaw colorization digital transfer original film . if you aware history behind film , you'll see it tragedy . if you not , it probably come off almost woody allen-ish comedy errors . either way very enjoyable 73 minutes	1
i enjoyed this movie , because plot slightly off kilter cast great . acting this movie superb , although it varied book , it still good itself . i recommend it people who like something different	1

first saw this movie when i 16 friends house . loved it . saw it tv few years ago , still loved it . witty , off wall humor , little corny sometimes , but my kind movie	1
i love this movie just i remember liking book child . guinness wonderful , everyone . rather than just appear know echo guinness wrote screenplay i would like say it brilliant subtle bawdy turns i no idea he so gifted . also rather than just seem erudite i would like say prokofiev background good idea gone wrong . it exciting while , but it got old . there more suite than snippet they eternally played . ( my erudition ) suite derived score movie . i liked human element best . i not care ( i'd seen movie before almost didn't buy it this reason ) marble through floor or fate last wall painted . i liked dialogue characterizations . it wonderful movie i highly recommend it everyone . ending not novel ( someone pointed out , i'd course forgotten ) , just knowing made me dislike it . i don't know why discovery should effect me . i accepted ending begin . finally , , when i military i knew gulley jimson . he dabbled art knew no bounds . however , he no talent , selfish beyond belief ( gulley ? ) child abuser ( mean variety , not sexual ) , his own daughter . so much him . guinness much more colorful ( like movie ) loveable . self-willed little grouch , but loveable .	1

live smokin filmed new york city , 1971 . what you see richard pryor very unpolished act . you clearly see pryor delivery professional timing still developmental stage . add he strung out cocaine when he performance . he told his audience he liked cocaine audience knew it . most people who seen this video not like it too much , but they failed see value what pryor able accomplish what others tried . i give very , very high accolades lenny bruce , he one best . he went down same road pryor , but he couldn't make it stick like pryor ( also not many people saw or heard bruce material ) . pryor really able talk his misgivings his troubled childhood . he ability cover subjects very taboo time , sexuality racism . racism itself tough subject cover . pryor showed world your face style what going black community how it related white community . live smokin , although not funny ground breaking event . here pryor laid groundwork what future stand-up comedy . film very dark primitive , but pryor his cocaine induced state , still managed talk his subject matter way you looking more . when you watch it you may not like comedy too much , but you watch it end . film more documentay pryor talking state affairs all different communities , black , white , hispanic or whatever . live smokin historic fact what it , peek into future subject matter stand-up comedy . he opened door so many performers all races . his ability make us laugh reality social truth uncanny . when you watch this film , don't look slap-happy drop dead laughs you get later pryor films . you see this film what it , historic comedic event time it made . you must see it whole complete coverage sign time ( 1971 ) glaring glimpse into future comedy . all modern comedians , george carlin included switch pryor type subject matter , or you wouldn't make it comedian . pryor set stage future , if your routine not include sex or racisim you would not make business . only other comedian not switch , again lenny bruce . big difference you see how pryor delivered his jokes . you must see " concert " , " live sunset strip " or " here now " see pryor full bloom . even those films you could see pryor still could ventured even more taboo subjects . look live smokin time piece . throughout his career pryor always maintained his subject matter , he always stayed black always told white audiences what happening black community , whites wanted listen . live smokin pieced together production looks like home movie , which what it , home movie pulled vaults made into video . this video showed true darkness pryor life we should applaud him sharing it us . pryor made great strides since live smokin , but this film only beginning , look what come . thing watchers didn't like this film did't see slew no-name characters prior used deliver his punchlines . these characters part evolution hip-hop culture or way black streets america . pryor always made sure portrayed black reality . live smokin he reveals whites , black world gambling , prostitution , poverty sex ( even homosexuality ) , dealing whites , police , hispanics , pushers drug users . like or even love this movie ( older people time ) you know what going background this film , what happening streets black white america . how whites viewed blacks or even how everybody viewed everybody . no one comedy history able make us laugh ourselves , social reality truth like richard pryor .	1
i turned this movie one morning glued it 30 mins because i just knew it joke ! whm spoke if he infomercial , actress who played student no better . knowing now it based play makes perfect sence . plays hardly ever translate good films ! acting play just totally different , overly dramatic , not believable . sorry , i hate write review based 30 mins middle movie , but i purposely researched title this one so i could warn others off . no , actually , watch it ! i want you see yourself how awful it ! i like w.h. macy	-1

although identifying phrase " film noir " yet used few decades , jean renoir " la bete humaine " could arguably considered one genre blueprints . fact , aside over-melodramatic music score , this naturalistic 1938 thriller looks feels very contemporary . jean gabin quite effective brooding train engineer plagued " blackouts " which he commits acts uncontrollable violence , usually precipitated moments passion ( freudians field day all point-of-view camerawork showing gabin chugging his big , powerful locomotive through long dark tunnels ) . beautiful simone simon sets mold all future femme fatales earthy , sophia loren-type sexuality not usually found movies 1930 . fact , it would 30 years or so before american crime films like " cold blood " " bonnie clyde " would adapt similar blend adult language , sexuality unflinching violence ( 1938 , hollywood too busy pumping out shirley temple movies ) . moody cinematography general existential malaise certainly doesn't make this " feel good " popcorn movie , but fans classic noir fascinated . ( note : this film remade 1954 " human desire " )	1
very compelling series , giving glimpse life under nazi occupation . one things i like most this series german officers depicted individuals -- some good people , some not . not all german army officers nazis ; least one characters here quite decent fellow , sense fairness even war , who himself victim nazi viciousness . you needn't wwii fan enjoy this drama . well written , well acted ; quality production . you'll want see series 2 , well . not masterpiece theatre , but perhaps should	1

if you like action flicks absolutely no intelligence this movie appeal your deepest hearts , but those you who prefer plot something makes least little sense .... skip it . sports camera crew sets out find most daring extreme sports heroes so it film action movie alps . they recruit couple crazy snow-boarders , helicopter pilots willing outrun avalanches then they toss pretty dainty olympic skier good measure some eye candy . entire film consists frilly skier competing fearless snow boarders attention film time . they get thrown out helicopters high altitude without any oxygen wearing barely any clothes but they never freeze ... funny how happens movies ! real amazing feat how they ski downhill front major avalanche still talk one ... you ever heard how loud avalanche ? thank goodness those sub-atomic hearing aids !! eventually european terrorists enter picture few automatic weapons ( something encourage those slow moving avalanches ) . well you know how it goes . action great if you like skiing some stunts literally unbelievable but other than i wouldn't recommend this film anyone half brain because you just frustrated all impossibilities missed reasons people die . i only watched it because i forced into it couch potato remote .	-1

while " easy money " may appear simple comedy , it really confronts us many problems our human condition . monty ( dangerfield ) shown child photographer who good his job . we soon learn he several vices . ( smoking , drinking , some illegal drugs , gambling , some lustful desires ) but he everyman . most us least 1 vice . some extent , we all monty . soon afterwards , his mother law offers $ 10,000,000 . monty if he shake off all his vices . ( lose weight top . ) monty friends confront us well . they great telling monty why he should go through it . they also really great telling monty he should not drink , smoke , overeat , etc . but they continue it themselves , times front poor monty . again , some extent , we all monty friends . make matters more difficult , monty rival heir clyde ( jeff jones ) wants money himself , so he looks ways tempt monty into his former vices . ( large extent , clyde represents presence devil . ) clyde not force , but he certainly tempt . quite convincingly , monty tense feelings start get better him , movie stops funny . notably sad scene where monty loses his job . ( record , i am guessing boxing scene taken out 2 reasons . ( . ) uncut form , there nothing indicate monty fallen asleep . ( . ) way , boxing scene breaks consistency film . monty losing his job most appropriately followed his crying front tv . ) moving , comedy reenters when clyde offers monty great job . but little monty know clyde going make one final attempt defeat monty . ( like devil , clyde can't just pull something out sky ... monty some extent consent accepting job ... patterns monty person somehow involved . ) yet moment devil , clyde confronts monty friends their hypocrisy : " if you're really monty friends , you'll stop making it so hard him ... you want monty money don't you ? " well scene , tensions explode monty house , we see desire money destroy our lives undoubtedly their problems , but really weren't so bad begin . side note : check paul letter timothy bible : " love money root all evil " (' timothy ' 6:10 ) . without ruining ending , monty comes through magnanimously . trip coney island , he invites forgives his friends ( who could more helpful him ) , someone who accidentally wounded him , even clyde who tried tempt him throughout . but devil ( clyde ) get one small but significant consolation prize he laughs darkly . this true life too . usually when we think we beat devil , he manages get small consolation prize . ( remember end " devil daniel webster ? " ) low class comedy ? not your life ! " easy money " confronts us our weaknesses , well our hypocrisies . it also shows us how desire money hurt us ; it shows how devil works ; it shows beauty forgiveness .	1

after seeing overhyped " american gothic " , i must say i came away disappointed . what you here movie constructed mold original " texas chainsaw massacre " where you some unsuspecting people coming up crazed homicidal family . unfortunately , family really comes off looking goofy silly more than dangerous deadly . i would certainly rather come upon ma pa family than leatherface his family if you know what i mean . " american gothic " decent job painting crazy family portrait sure , but ma , pa company just not exactly strike fear viewer heart ... they just not formidable far their prowess horror movie villains . kills not too bad , but certainly not anything write home . acting okay production values not too bad movie this nature . i just not like way ma pa family came across viewer ... they come across more weird than horrifying , more eccentric than anything else not exactly dangerous . don't get me wrong ... obviously , they killed some people , but i not convinced manner which this or family disposition brutal killers . also , i felt ending rather weak very predictable . i guess they just not make them like they used anymore . short , way i look " american gothic " if original " texas chainsaw massacre " five stars horror movie , then this movie , comparatively speaking , certainly worth no more than one star ... it what it folks !	-1

if you willing overlook fact video times poor sound often uneven ( otherwise , i'd given it 4 stars ) , then you great treat . sheer energy enthusiasm both cast audience unmatched , mis en scene unique time forever gone , new york city end 70 shift into 80 . kline terrific routledge great : these two make show ( watch routledge dramatics end act 1 ; kline brilliant his " pirate king " song , his antics act ii during " paradox " " away , away " scene classic ) . rose major general . ronstadt commendable ( any pop singer who tries their hand operattic singing my respect - well , maybe not michael bolton ... ) . even smith bearable ( bit cheesy , but what you gonna - least he doesn't seem take himself all seriously either ) . although some liked movie version better , least this production its entirety ( movie stupidly leaves out end act 1 finale after " oh happy day " , second versus " policeman lot " " sighing softly " ) . it also resurrects " major general " reprieve lyrics end act ii originally used gilbert new york premiere , which typically don't get included , but actually tie up show perfectly . added bonus use " matter patter " song ruddigore slightly changed lyrics ( kline last verse one breath ! ) . so , take it what it : great performance intermittently marred sub-standard video/audio production ..	1
this according leonard maltin movie guide . i'm little confused this very definite statement john huston " asphalt jumgle , " film very similar its basic heist-gone-wrong story , appeared four years earlier ( 1950 1954 ) . there trilogy these type films made through mid-fifties ; you add kubrick " killing " ( 1956 ) this genre film . each films , relatively small group men scheme pull-off perfect heist , initially succeed , but something or someone inevitably intervenes spoil entire endeavor . it would difficult judge which these three films best its kind , but what truly unique jules dassin " rififi " entire heist sequence complete silence , truly audacious approach filmmaking . three films discussed here share many common traits . directors either co-wrote or wrote screenplays which adaptations novels . there film noir quality three , especially " rififi . " each populated unsavory characters leaving viewer no one whom really identify . all three films photographed black white , dassin only foreign language one , french english subtitles . people who love movies but refuse tackle subtitles need get over it . days when poorly subtitles distracted viewer concentration long gone . persons responsible subtitling put much care making them imminently readable . once you've watched few foreign films , you hardly even notice it now . overall aversion watching foreign films puzzling . limiting yourself only american films , you're missing some greatest films ever made . this criterion collection film one those great films . all cc films , this transfer dvd flawless picture sound . dassin made films all over place . italy , usa france . he blacklisted during mccarthy commie witch hunt , fleeing france where he then made " rififi " which he received best director prize cannes film festival . today heist films , such " ocean 11 12 , " pale comparison these three films . thieves good guys , cops bad , they most part , succeed .

this one most captivating love stories i've ever seen film . it starts young woman ( katya , played vera alentova ) reporting her worker dormitory friends she flunked two points exam get into university . it ends most incredible sweetness life . it like french film russian company ( which what it ) . moscow we see not believe tears believe love , it not moscow politics , although some people call one " comrade . " this woman point view film ( " chick flick " ) transcends any genre cage . it begins slowly , almost painfully dull way remind viewer all cliches russia , unstylish dress , worker paradise isn't , sharp contrast moscow peasants who live outside city . katya works factory . she works drill press . she obviously underemployed . lyudmila ( irina muravyova ) works bakery . she probably gainfully employed time place . they friends , twentysomethings who make man , but not man sticks . they pretend university post docs or something close they impress some people they house-sit beautiful moscow apartmen t.t his how their adult life begins sense . lyudmila falls love athlete ; katya becomes infatuated television cameraman . one thing leads before we know it they forty . neither relationship worked out . athlete becomes alcoholic , cameraman , sway his mother , believes katya beneath him ( once he finds out she works factory ) . how wrong he , course . but no more plot . i won't spoil it . plot important . characterizations important . story like russian novel it spans lots time , but once you engaged you find two half hours fly you , perhaps like me , say end " what great movie ! " my hat off director vladimir menshov valentin chernykh who wrote script cast . i've mentioned vera alentova irina muravyova , but aleksey batlov who played gosha also excellent . i don't want say anymore . just watch film . it one best i've ever seen	1

camille claudel sculptor time when women discouraged art - especially most muscular arts , sculpture . such her genius , though , she accepted rodin student . he supported her career , both his assitant artist her own right . some people say her skill outstripped even his . why , then , her work so little known today ? certainly not because it appeal faded time . it still all power move viewer it ever . reason probably there so very little her work , even less extant today . her career lasted only few her adult years . illness mind drove her people venues supported her , drove her destroy much her own work . end , illness left her unable even care herself . she hospitalized 1913 , died 1943 without regaining her sanity , her freedom , or her career . this lovely movie documents her life up 1913 . it shows her early promise , her rise success , her collapse into incapacity . basic historical facts , best my knowledge , sound , but may stretched few places . her relationship rodin shown , but may not given emphasis it warranted . her removal hospital insane shown , too , but may not peaceable affair displayed here . no matter . claudel artist deserves attention , claudel woman leaves us asking what wonders illness stole her history . //wiredweir	1
though based famous character phil silver famous oldie tv show , new " sergeant bilko " less homage show than it classic steve martin his 1970 days . though this bilko ( again shifty tireless grafter , evil face non-coms everywhere ) very much opportunist silvers ' character ( he runs base casino ) , shy risk silvers ( unit mobilization orders desert storm mysteriously disappeared ) manages get caught his own dealings silvers ( bilko botches fixing army boxing match , unwittingly tricking each boxer think he one who supposed take fall ) screwball zaniness very much out steve martin snl days . script bilko unit charged testing brand new army weapon - " hovertank " soon cancelled because , among other things , it simply doesn't work . hovertank end spell doom his own cozy position doesn't seem bother bilko , mostly because he lives day-to-day . things change when officer charged evaluating hovertank turns out fearsome major thorn ( phil hartman ) . years earlier , bilko unwittingly made enemy thorn accidentally implicating him one his bitched schemes . now major , thorne isn't simply content enough eliminate hovertank , but must now axe bilko well . they say desperate times reveal man , bilko now revealed spineless weasel his troops come love . martin plays bilko like character one his old snl skits . it sort fun watch guy work material we haven't seen since his more sedate days playing less zany funnymen ( " la story " , " roxanne " ) more mature dramatic roles ( " spanish prisoner " , " grand canyon " update " silas marner " ) . it light breezy you'll probably forget most gags , script under-uses most supporting cast ( especially now late-great phil hartman bilko evil nemesis ) , but it still fun	1

" big combo " thoroughly characteristic classic film noir , which remarkable it latecomer classic film noir movement , released 1955 . cinematographer john alton may film noir most expressionistic photographer , " big combo " exploits his precision low-key lighting penchant shooting through fog their greatest advantage . philip yordan wrote " crusading cop " story directly screen , great noir tradition , included no real good guys or victims among his characters . police lieutenant leonard diamond ( cornel wilde ) trying 6 months find something incriminate infamous elusive mr. brown ( richard conte ) , financial arm his city crime syndicate , come up emptyhanded . one evening mr. brown mistress , susan lowell ( jean wallace ) , attempts suicide her desperation escape life she made herself , diamond takes advantage opportunity arrest her pressure her information . she tells him nothing , but her delirium , she repeats name " alicia " . convinced alicia might important clue cracking mr. brown , diamond rounds up questions everyone associated brown , including man himself , inciting bloody war his own brown conflicting obsessions . mr. brown articulates film perspective when he mockingly calls diamond " righteous man " . " big combo " one film noir most obvious examples sexualization violence . we see standards changing production code relaxing this film . explicit torture scenes undisguised sexuality very different techniques than " gun crazy " , noir sex violence masterpiece , employed 6 years earlier . " big combo " very good film whose sensational aspects augment its edginess without explicit enough overwhelm its themes . but it made me realize , if classic film noir movement lasted much longer than it , increasingly loose standards what could shown movies would produced films tawdry gory instead introverted subversive . they , course , but film noir passed point , if it hadn't , graphic overstatement would it . image entertainment dvd , released 2000 , no bonus features or subtitles	1

i've writing downbeat reviews lately , so i decided write one one five funniest movies ever . just answer obvious question , others monty python meaning life , south park : bigger , longer , uncut , seven year itch bank dick . reason this one so good because howard hawk direction , super sharp wilder-brackett script , gary cooper innate comic timing ( sadly under used his career ) , barbara stanwyck second best comic role her career ( lady eve role die ) boatload wily character actors . premise stems eight professors spending several years writing encyclopedia help willed grant them all living under same roof nyc mansion . one day garbageman ( allen jenkins ) enters their sheltered circle some eye-opening questions prof . potts ( cooper ) realizes his three weeks compiling slang obsolete . he decides he must leave his austere surroundings learn language street . this decision met much apprehension his seven older associates . he braves street all day recruiting wide array slang-savvy consultants . he winds up night club featuring gene krupa sugarpuss o'shea ( stanwyck ) . i think my favorite part movie when potts goes backstage recruit sugarpuss she tries give him brush . well , pretty soon we've got wild mix sex academics gangsters . it sweet without syrupy , it deals mores without sanctimonious . this neat trick very rarely achieved makes this always funny movie better than rest . also , me , it funniest ending ever . boogie	1
i'm nostalgic person this nostalgic movie . great recreation late 60s/early 70s era . i distinctly remember road trips my family avocado green station wagon scenic destinations smokey mountains . we've rented many cabins stayed occupied hours simple activities , long before sophisticated entertainment crept . this movie unfolds dynamic time when age discovery/peace movement challenged conservative lifestyles . pearl ( diane lane ) looking something more than " good mother " role she trapped . like so many women who marry young bear children , she wife mother what seems like life time ( married 17 ) , fulfilling needs her husband children . lure fantasy excitement too much overcome she drawn free wheeling , happy go lucky character played viggo mortensen . lucky her she could experience some things she completely missed out , still keep her family together . i like way movie ends because pearl returns her husband better appreciate life her husband better appreciate what pearl sacrificed raise their family . many story lines weaved into movie . this my top 10 list	1

dear quentin , how things going , man ? i heard new film uma . sounds great . you see my newest film " lucky numbers " ? i play russ richards , local celebrity weatherman harrisburg , pennsylvania . russ adoring fans , his own table omelet denny , snowmobile dealership . due uncommonly warm weather , his dealership go under , crumbling his entire financial empire . out desperation , he pays visit gig ( tim roth ) , owner local strip club . gig suggests russ his `friend ' crystal ( lisa kudrow ) rig state lottery . crystal works same station pulls numbers out lottery . crystal all idea . she also dating dick simmons ( ed o'neil ) , station manager he neglecting her . her share winnings help her break free . everything , course , gets complicated . funny , huh ? it it moments . quentin , you know i like work people i know . it makes me feel comfortable . acting hard , man . i need comfort help me create my characters . nora ephron directed film . she i worked together " michael " , which pretty successful , so i hoping lightning would strike twice . i really enjoyed reading screenplay . basically it combines elements dark comedy farce . people act weird , some people die , people mean one . but they also act really silly . i haven't lot farce but i laughed when i read screenplay . my track record comedy spotty , but if someone $20 million decent script , i'm game . lisa i great together . she plays someone very different her well-known persona `friends ' . crystal very different phoebe . crystal edge , determination makes her very interesting . crystal few moments also make her seem real , very important factor farce . if character doesn't least tiny grounding reality , farce doesn't work . lisa gets this makes it work . i get it , too , made it work during scene denny ... scene snow mobile dealership ... scene television studio when they reveal someone killed ... ... well , i know i made it work somewhere . i'm no film historian , but it works . supporting characters top notch . michael moore plays crystal dimwitted cousin . he very funny . tim roth good , but doesn't lot laughs . but that ok . he primarily dramatic actor anyway . actors should play their strengths . michael rappaport plays local thug . he all over place . hell , most supporting cast all over place . that ok , because this farce , right ? i know reviewers pick up fact everyone film greedy , unlikable they really don't like each other . there isn't really anyone care . that ok . these characters based real people . they don't need likable . they need funny . they funny . aren't they ? sometimes ? yes . they some funny moments . nora great director . she good hand comedy , especially farce . every farce i ever seen too many laughs . you're laughing when joke happens . you can't keep track it all . thankfully , nora slowed everything down ... quite ... ... bit . her pacing glacial . but i like . i ability laugh jokes . quentin , i'm just not sure . i've string dogs lately . i'm not good actor . i'm movie star . i am persona draws people into movies . they shouldn't expect my performance subtle or even well-modulated . if i'm playing local celebrity weatherman , i'm going play it all smarminess i . i'm going mug grin every character recognizes me . i'm going wear local fame my sleeve when things start go wrong , i'm going shake , rub my head , run around circles , really frustrated . i play characters . but lately , people haven't coming films .

what motivates murderer , even serial killer become one ? ask such question preposterous because it no answer . least it what film advocates end . this contradiction fbi profiling technique , but only superficially . fact profiling technique only looks defines killing pattern , eventually psychological pattern serial killer , not cause his or her killer . so question legitimate , yet film comes conclusion it impossible answer . yet it proposes difference normal person who eventually kill killer : former experience remorse , whereas latter won't . but this very short approach once contradicted film itself recording killer who says serial killer who grow old , who evade justice survive haunted his murders . but it said such way we don't know if he experiences remorse or regret it or simply regret it this or way instead could better . he feel pleasure or fear or horror or disgust ? this film hence seen contrast two other films deal serial killers , `the silence lambs ' `seven ' . even so , there probably no answer initial question , least no simple answer all kinds murders murderers . why profiling technique might limited pertinence . it may good police technique but it probably not good explain foresee moment when way how man or woman becomes criminal . dr jacques coulardeau , universit� paris dauphine , universit� paris i panth�on sorbonne	1
i love how this movie portrays striking coal miners their wives innocent angels while scabs called " gun thugs " who just open fire innocently peaceful protesters machine guns . film-maker spends 99% film strikers doesn't try too hard get opinions scabs mining company workers . after all , scabs people who work miners not want themselves . work anyway . mining company this film not only gave its employees wages but also housed all them too . course wages housing conditions lousy but housing employees not employer job ! any sane person ( or anyone who seen major strike person ) finds it hard believe scabs sole instigators during strikes strikers pure victims . scabs just trying go work support their families too but violently harassed strikers who same work but choose not . if work good enough scabs , then why isn't it good enough strikers ? strikers also use more than just words taunt scabs . they use sticks , clubs occasionally guns or knives hurt scabs whom they believe taking their jobs away them . this film , when scabs defend themselves right go into work without getting hurt or killed ho t-t empered strikers , it scabs who always portrayed " gun thugs " " evil " while strikers always seen saint-like , perfectly behaved unjustly discriminated against . why else police officers scene most major strikes ? protect strikers ? hell no . they there protect scabs who trying go into work but subjected constant harassment strikers . this film even token black striker , who happens get all white striker folks . but guess who uses " n-word " this movie toward black person ? you guessed it ... evil scab . i wonder if this film would shown strikers ' reaction black scab if there one . probably not . bottom line : if you pro-union believe scabs scum earth strikers no wrong , then " harlan county , u.s.a.

this german film directed hermine huntgeburth like comic spin grifters but added sexual component . when one 3 petty criminals who wallet snatch using blind man ploy injured chase , replacement chosen someone who tried steal them failed . his punishment stripped two gay male members team , which prefigures sexual triangle eventuates when both father his daughter attracted new member . we know when we told group rule no exchange body fluids it said broken . huntgeburth gets comic mileage out who aggressor each relationship stolen moments intimacy they fear discovered third party . most refreshing touch how father ( gotz george ) established mean his gay partner , yet he becomes foolish when faced attentions younger man , if he cannot believe it possible , shakespearian appearance george emphasises him classically defined pathetic figure . george actually resembles brunette heavy-set ralph fiennes . daughter probably least interesting role , but felix eitner boy demonstrates bisexual trend modern sexuality , free sexual preference european men , question sex duplicitious behaviour . when eitner pet snake disposed cruelly , huntgeburth sets up expectation his own fate , snake metaphor . accordian music niki reiser sets tone it melancholy suggestion exotic mischief , thankfully huntgeburth treatment lacks concluding cruelty stephen frears title	1

i didn't care this version all . i thought there no chemistry two leads , there should least some smoldering repressed emotions . story so abbreviated so seem just conventional , brief story thwarted love -- character development , especially jane , missing action . no heartbreak , no horror , no sense jane virtue , tough interior self-reliance , which helped her overcome so many life obstacles . not even much atmospheric scenery . this mr. rochester , played usually-excellent ciaran hines , utterly forgettable , weak , miscast . he doesnt handsome , but he powerful , passionate , sexy , seething . after all , he keeps mad wife locked attic he tries keep secret while almost commiting bigamy . instead , try timothy dalton version which excellent though now little low-budget looking , or 2007 even sexier faster-paced version toby stevens ruth wilson , which outstanding best yet . it moves right , yet it keeps all story essentials .	-1

frankly , i didn't expect this docu-drama good it . alec baldwin not favorite i doubted what he might portraying justice robert jackson . nevertheless , jackson far perfect himself , both personally professionally , so maybe it fit casting . 60 years , no one else courage take this important story , so give mr. baldwin his due , both leading actor co-executive producer . staging , costumes , cinematography outstanding this made-for-tv production . views bombed-out city nuremberg seem genuine beginning end . reconstruction palace justice extremely well . old car buff , i enjoyed seeing vehicles 1940 50 so well maintained . big social gatherings lavish well-staged . summary , this big-budget production . rating this movie i might given it 5 stars except portrayal british prosecutors . this understated quite bit . sir david maxwell-fife , not judge jackson , one who unmasked hermann goering psychopathic monster he truly . moreover , fellow-britisher , sir hartley showcross , given credit most moving summation , not jackson . no one cast play showcross part which unfortunate given outstanding british actors available . weakness how soviets depicted . comrades rudenko , nikitchenko , others contributed lot what happened nuremberg real trial , despite constant kibbitzing moscow . this only true international tribunal war crimes all four prosecuting countries , u . ., great britain , france , ussr played their roles . casting movie , one inevitably compares 1961 landmark movie , " judgment nuremberg . " film spencer tracy , maxmillian schell ( who won best actor oscar year ) , burt lancaster , richard widmark , montgomery clift , marlene dietrich , judy garland , several others note . these even included william shatner his first big-screen performance . no way 2000 production compare 1961 film depth characterization sheer poetry screenplay abby mann . yet , because commanding presence spencer tracy american lead judge , haywood , role lifetime maxmillian schell , other performances overlooked . my view , burt lancaster eloquent chief german judge , ernst janning . several his lines movie still haunt me , especially : " we deaf ? dumb ? blind ? " then , rejoinder spencer tracy end : " but herr janning , it came first time you sentenced man death you knew innocent . " finally , marlene dietrich remarkable her limited role . who forget scene her sitting alone dark letting phone ring , judge haywood calling say goodbye ? nevertheless , there some important performances newer movie must acknowledged . brian cox absolutely first-rate hermann goering . one minute he jovial family man ; next , psychopathic killer founder gestapo . i no longer see mr. cox just exceptional narrator world war ii documentaries . others point out , cox literally steals show " nuremberg . " moreover , german actor herbert knaup , who portrays albert speer , memorable job , goering counterweight nazi defendants . speer seems sincerely repentant his part war crimes this saves his life . his final statement court worth watching re-watching , he warns mankind next major war could destroy globe itself . christopher plummer fine david maxwell-fife , but screenwriter only gave him one big scene . where he described nazi mass execution ukraine -- spine chilling moment sure . reality , maxwell-fife star prosecution team , said above , he deserves far more credit than he got this movie . it true , critics point out , hanging condemned men not proceed , one , two , three , shown this film . rather , some men took 20 minutes or more , die . also , i agree other reviewers who found fault love affair depicted jackson his secretary . we could dispensed favor some other more weighty things , including defense two nazi naval officers . it , movie runs 3 hours so not great deal time could spent subject . but defense made capt . kranzbuehler , saved lives admirals raeder doenitz . moreover , kranzbuehler set precedents international law his defense . comparing " nuremberg " other tv miniseries third reich , i'd say it notch below " hitler : rise evil " ( 2003 ) , starring robert carlyle " inside third reich " ( 1982 ) , rutger hauer , john gielgud , derek jakobi . i see " nuremberg " par , though , " bunker " ( 1981 ) , starring anthony hopkins . i would highly recommend newer movie , " nuremberg , " despite its flaws . i got it loan friend plan buy dvd later my collection . " nuremberg " not measure up " judgment nuremberg , " but few films ever . newer film tells much different story may take literary license way . these points notwithstanding , it makes contribution our understanding third reich , world foulest tyranny . we must try understand it , lest we repeat it .	1
one last biblical epics , this bomb its initial release , deservedly so . movie doesnt know whether it de mille or italian realism , most sequences ( adam eve , tower babel ) either laughable or langorous ( george scott ava gardner abraham sarah ) . yet stuck middle fine half hour sequence story noah , director john huston casting himself one strong sequence movie : replete right mix humor awe . half hour isnt enough recommend buying or renting dvd , but if you catch it tv some day , its worth half hour your life .	-1

exception jaws possibly deep blue sea , you could take all these shark attack movies lump them together ; just change actors , sometimes location , but you end up same thing : poor special effects , so-so acting some occasional laughs and/or thrills . this entry like other two shark attack movies generic fluff , little novelty or variety distinguish it . cast thorsten kaye ( studly hero ) , nikita alger ( hot diver ) daniel alexander ( studly if obnoxious steve irwin clone ) gamely tries breathe life , but this just movie which shark should eaten whole bunch	-1

1960 era terrifically beautiful actresses , ranging ursula andress starlets hammer film productions . among highest order cinematic goddesses young jane fonda , whose performance title role " barbarella " remains extremely erotic--today more explicit sexuality notwithstanding . film slight storyline concerns futuristic " astro-navigatrix " trying track down mad scientist prevent him using horrific weapon he invented . hot his trail our heroine encounters all manner intergalactic beings who their best separate her her unusually frail space-girl costumes ; blind angel , sadistic " leather men , " children w/carnivorous dolls , tyrannical lesbian queen all eager entice barbarella into their various fun games . finally , when space-girl catch up her quarry ( crazed scientist wonderfully named duran duran ) he too wants work out his fantasies her ; he subjects her his " excessive machine " -- pleasant torture device supposedly kills inducing lethal number orgasms ! fortunately , barbarella [ ... ] capabilities outlast machine , causing it collapse broken fuses . so it goes until less-than-inevitable , but happy , finale . all all this film fantastic episodes brilliant , inspired . barbarella narrow escape flesh-eating dolls well her many encounters lesbian tyrant ( played hilt anita pallenberg ) truly imaginative sequences . other highlights include film initial scene -- barbarella doing strip-tease zero-gravity chamber ; her down-and-dirty defeat duran duran nasty machine . essence there very few dull moments entire film . director roger vadim -- jane fonda husband time -- height his considerable powers . mistress fonda herself glorious ; such unlikely role , her extreme beauty blended harmoniously essential innocence way made her cinematic descendant marilyn monroe ! any actress any time there no higher praise than comparison marilyn ; jane fonda case , such comparison actually deserved . my highest ratings .	1

there interesting story beethoven concerning his intense concentration sheer immersion music while midst composing . young man knocked his door deliver message , important message patron wanting commission his work . maestro answered door , delivery boy taken aback , beethoven appeared frazzled , dark rings under his eyes mad expression . boy asked wait , he would only few moments . well , young man waited waited , hearing most beautiful music he ever encountered . over two hours transpired when maestro finally came back door . " herr beethoven , i waiting over two hours deliver this most urgent message ! " composer appeared genuinely confused , " you must mistaken , i only away few moments ! " he then snatched message out boy hands slammed door . my mind , this fine example pure genius work . immortal beloved ( 1994 ) upon its theatrical release panned professional critics over top ; gary oldman overacted director ( bernard rose ) use too many clich�s tell speculative story secret lover beethoven . early nineties time where it fashionable negative critical just everything ... fashionable cynicism . viewed dvd first time since seeing film ( over 12 years ago ) theatre , there no doubt these " professional critics " way off mark . this excellent film manages capture beginnings romantic age music . beethoven right cusp classical romantic movements ... tragedy heroism which mark sensibilities romantic movement stands well represented this moving film . gary oldman one gifted actor portrayed mad genius realism intensity it so well deserves . beethoven music all alone without knowing anything composer continue move audiences ' until end time , however , tragic fact maestro stone deaf while composing majority his music , particularly , ode joy , absolutely astonishing ! it known he actually sawed legs off grand piano , bringing it floor order " feel " vibrations clearer . isabella rossellini countess absolutely superb stunning her eyes convey so much emotion when her character talks her love , maestro . there some beautiful scenes old vienna film , well , this would greatest sound track all time . this wonderful film , love story more than likely greatest romantic history : ludwig von beethoven .	1

i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1

band awesome . no doubt it , but that just it . they band . robbie robertson ( spelling correct ) somehow fooled other band members into letting him songwriting credit ( robertson got them particiapte , against their better wishes , " last waltz " concert accompanying film ) . take look band drummer levon helm book , " this wheel fire , " he explains robertson someone band management talked group into giving robertson sole ( or majority ) songwriting credit , so they all could supposedly benefit financially . robertson got rich , while others didn't . it shame , since helm , keyboardist richard manuel ( rip ) bassist rick danko ( rip ) all better voices than robbie . there also great photo helm book helm showing robertson how play something robertson stratocaster . great picture . it shows it group effort , but robertson " last waltz " film erronneously claim robertson leader chief talent . " last waltz " concert filmed martin scorsese , robbie buddy . if robertson truly lone genius band , don't you think his solo work would much better ? also , words arkansas-born levon helm himself , " you really think guy canada ( robertson ) wrote ' night they drove old dixie down ' all himself ?

i first saw this film college cinema class . after we watched it , long discussion ensued , led largely feminist-minded females class , number scenes where brando shirtless vs . number times maria schneider ( mercifully brandon kept his haines all times ) . we talked how this " male-eyed " film , how schneider character never fully developed , etc ., etc . almost 20 years later , i realize there no way class 20-somethings could appreciated what we seeing , thus true greatness film eluded young , high-minded college students more interested maria nipples than brando angst . not once any us talk shattering scene where brando confronts his dead wife . if there anything last tango paris i took me , it , amazing acting therein . i really don't care schneider boobs , which honestly aren't all great anyhow . what makes this film great me structure old(er ) , beaten down cynical man going through grief , who bumps into young , fresh woman who doesn't really know who she or why she wants what she wants . schneider said bertolucci kept her dark during much filming . one hopes it evoke this pure , almost wide-eyed performance her not out any disrespect or cruelty , although schneider late said she'd never work him again . her performance here effortless . more importantly , there chemistry her brando works . it may seem strange talk chemistry movie where male lead rapes bullies female lead , but it there . watch scene bathroom , where he shaving , marvel spontaneous-sounding dialogue feeling real relationship there . brando perfect his role . story unfolds slowly ( they'd never make film this kind pacing today ) , brando becomes least somewhat more sympathetic ( complex ) it goes . this isn't brute brando but rather complex , deeply wounded brando who brings out brute him only keep world bay . after his catharsis he shows side himself , probably more typical side , schneider she just can't cope--it hard me tell , even after repeated viewings , if it because she getting married someone else ( how happy she'll remains serious doubt me ) , because she afraid three-dimensional brando who really seems now want her more than casual sex , or what . some ways ending arbitrary , but it still struck me more plausible organic than similar sudden endings night porter marriage maria braun . throughout , bertolucci shoots most interior scenes schneider brando sunset . bathed orange , they stillness yet intensity other scenes lack . it seems orange color bertolucci set aside deep revelations realizations . film distrubing , but somehow also cathartic . feeling wanting say " --- world " one many us relate , something brando himself many times his career . print scratched soundtrack somewhat tinny . there numerous times where dirt or fuzz gate seen top or bottom edge frame whole scenes . this film cries out full-blown restoration . dvd contains nothing else but trailer , strange trailer it . you'd think dvd movie this famous would feature commentaries , documentaries , where-they-are-now type featurettes , etc . this classic short-changed . but * * many people today see last tango paris classic ? this somehthing i wondered i read reviews online after seeing dvd . heralded masterpiece turning point cinema when it released , it now clear it anything but . rather than continue personal films sometimes disturbed psyche questioned soul moviegoer , hollywood then other filmmakers turned empty spectacle 70s waned , trading boobs lightsabers . last tango hailed 1972 beginning new cinema , but it also end it . few exceptions ( unbearable lightness comes quickest mind ) this sort film would never made again , last tango become some ways anachronistic . just reading online reviews , most them probably written people their 20s whom terminator 2 ancient movie , it becomes clear we don't really understand this sort picture anymore , made uncomfortable it . there no simple line action . there no " plot . " there long stretches no dialogue , or least where characters don't tell you dialogue what they doing . television movies merged style , technique subject matter , last tango other films period become more like museum relics than living , breathing cinema . perhaps that one reason why we haven't seen restoration . unless criterion gets its hands this film , i don't much hopes . too bad , because last tango represents whole type filmmaking that largely unknown today , even film " students , " if it known it becoming more curiosity than , i said , living , breathing cinema . all more reason rent this , then , witness whole approach movie-making no longer exists -- certainly not usa .	1

last reviewer interpretation book involves narrow understanding profit motive " greed " no understanding property rights . ( same problem environmental movement today . ) ... someone truly driven profit ( once-ler ) motive would not cut down all his truffula trees , but rather would replant manage his truffula forests order continue his biggering ( growth ) into future . same time , habitat forest creatures continuously renewed ( dispelling this apparent dichotomy ) . lorax , there no clearly assigned property rights . thus , once-ler no incentive protect his own property . indeed , since no one owns surrounding property either , once-ler also allowed pollute , well . they no recourse sue him or exact compensation , so once-ler allowed spread cost his activities onto everyone else . this known economists social theorists tragedy commons ... lesson i'll teach my kids this book respect other property , nature , " common property " ends disaster	1

i think if charles bukowski , dylan thomas , fellini collaborated piece writing , it possible they would come up this screenplay . this movie exciting because it soooo different anything i've ever seen . deliciously non-linear . substance abuse aspect little overdone but that destiny quot ; artist moviesquot ; . i loved hearing dialog , kristofferson acting best i've ever seen him . anything so daring so unconventional naturally upset some people ( like other reviewers here ) , but if you ask me only validates work . if ever i go new york city , hotel chelsea top my list places visit . my favorite lines crazy guy elevator , who after claiming conversation dylan thomas said ghosts naturally reside places like chelsea because people listen them there . dvd extras contain couple quirky interviews , one director ethan hawke other robert sean leonard who plays deeply troubled folksinger film	1

those you interested seeing delicate sensitive portrayal s/m relationship , i would highly suggest japanese film , " moonlight whispers " over " maitresse . " film gentle coming-of-age film male sub/fem dom theme , while " maitresse " somewhat confused film ex-con who stumbles into dungeon ( highly unlikely ) vanilla relationship dominitrix . ex-con cannot deal " her career " eventually threatens her quit , etc . ( some point , you get idea director himself really doesn't understand where domina coming . ) what started out interesting film provacative opening soon falls apart halfway through . writer/director seems lose narrative thread film things degenerate ex-con wanting buy dominitrix out her protection ( or pimp , want better word ) . then , we watch ex-con -- totally unrelated gratuitous foray -- goes slaughterhouse , where real horse shown killed onscreen , strung up stabbed drained blood it kicks helplessly ( this image upset you weeks , believe me ! [ i feel like it my duty warn you ! ]) . film gets even worse there finally ends up ridiculous car accident two main characters laughing like idiots . totally stupid ( like writer/director suddenly ran out ideas ) . believe me , i really wanted like this movie . i ignored negative reviews , because there so few " real " films this subject . but i sorely disappointed depressed it . if you need see this film , rent it . it definitely " one view " film best ; it film leave you angry ( because horse scene ) vaguely disgusted -- generally bummed out . too bad . " moonlight whispers " much better , respectful treatment s/m , film real characters nuance -- one seeks explore real psychological ( sexual orientation ) questions , while also beautiful film watch . film deserves seen -- wider audience !	-1
i served us army sfor . i think this excellent well film . it perhaps most accurate film i seen concerning war bosnia . it not only accurately reflects shows genocide carried out slobodan milosevic , ratko mladic rodavan kradzic but it also gives hints but not quite come out expose whole truth . soldier who served bosnia i tell you whole truth this film seeks poke . it shows how united states acted accomplices slobodan milosevic genocide carried out against bosnian muslim population . it plainly shows american officials lying american people . i would also like add former president clinton seen this movie himself actor woody harrelson mr. clinton knows full well he lied american people what really going bosnia . honest you .... it truth must told . i am aching tell it everybody i find . i shocked see dead bodies when i bosnia further shocked discover lies us government told american people . i think it very important every american watch this film . order fully understand film i highly recommend peter maass book " love they neighbor .

one most controversial movies ever made , this early 1970s ' masterpiece cemented reputations jack nicholson mike nichols , proved art garfunkel act , gave candice bergen her big break , turned ann-margret into serious actress . initially , " carnal knowledge " greeted mixed reactions , but over time considered groundbreaking its frank portrayal sexual relationships two womanizing friends over nearly 30 year period . film starts off college , where two friends name jonathan ( nicholson ) sandy ( garfunkel ) roommates who dote sex nothing else . when sandy meets susan ( bergen ) mixer , he immediately smitten her , jonathan , who takes her under his own wing . few years go we see sandy become involved jennifer ( carol kane ) . finally , jonathan falls love beautiful , , yes , busty bobbie ( ann-margret , who deservedly got oscar nomination her role ) . their relationship becomes rougher years go , culminating one nicholson greatest fits rage ever , matched ann emotional breakdown she begs him marry her . film seems very crowded , but plot unfolds so smoothly , you never get sense " gosh , i wanna shut this off because i don't understand it " , since every storyline it grabs you never lets go . performances this film perfect . nicholson gives one his best performances ever jonathan , while ann-margret gives what may well her single greatest performance her career . it great see these two perform together , nicholson my favorite actor ann my favorite actress . two play off each other so well they make film watchable their chemistry alone . garfunkel perfect choice play sandy . everyone may know him one half simon garfunkel , but watching him play part , he embodies it so well you can't imagine anyone playing role . though she leaves movie pretty early , candice bergen superb portrayal susan , carol kane great jennifer . rita moreno not appear until last scene , but she really make most her screen time . " carnal knowledge " cinematic masterpiece belongs any dvd collectio . not hesitate purchasing this movie . it must	1

there far too few movies made just fun these days . down periscope proof you don't need fancy special effects or giant budget make fun movie . my teenagers loved it , setting it up same shelf zoolander super-troopers . kelsey grammer wonderful job seems relish his role , playing it controlled fun hallmark movie . known his unorthodox activities he drawn ire admiral graham ( bruce dern who appears lot fun his role well ) ends up worst crew dredged up worst sub ( old rusty diesel boat ) found worst assignment - go up against entire modern navy . fortunately grammer up task underhanded tactics brilliant maneuvers he performs bring laugh almost everyone . crew consists stereotypes , flatulant cook , grizzled old veteran , spoiled son admiral , basketball star , spit-and-polish xo , but actors manage bring them off charm , especially electrician who grammer notes " absorbed lot voltage " . addition big laughs , there little scenes bring smile , such during first dive when panicked crewman heads aft " see if other rooms still tilted " ultimately it feel-good movie . it doesn't highlight any great moral conflicts , but its great diversion settle down enjoy rainy day one few movies you probably get your teenagers sit you watch ! special note , san franciscans immediately notice backdrop used " mothball fleet " suisun bay docked sub shots " stingray " uss pampanito , sub open tours pier 39 - you even see other piers end .	1

this flik first three linked episodes ( ii , iii , iv ) 6 star trek movies . both this movie first trek movie their roots 60s tv series . first movie more or less redo voyager tv episode ( only much more grand scale all technology special effect bells whistles ) . instead redo tv episode , trek ii continuation khan episode some 15 years later . genesis project plays role ii iii aftermath ( when kirk crew try return earth ) stage iv . not spoil plot ( if we all not seen this least once ! ) , this film , like other trek movies fun watch because screen chemistry cast . like 60s tv series bonanza , each film morality play . i enjoyed tv series 60s ( though now it look bit campy dated , but still hoot watch ) . transition little big screen , i think they good job . they maintain esential elements tv show while broadening scope larger venue . acting just good screen plays excellent . i not watched these fliks perhaps 10 years recently dusted off my vcr tapes viewed all six . it nice seeing kirstie alley babe instead tv diet commercial balloon . when these films first came out , i thought kirk crew really aging . now it 25 30 years later , it amazing how young they look !	1

it unsettling find something you've treasured , now seen or met again , leaves you feeling little flat . you change worse ... you become jaded ... less open feeling emotion ? or perhaps what you liked so much then simply isn't wonder you thought it . young girl ( jenny agutter ) , 14 , her brother ( billed lucien john , who actually nicolas roeg son , luc ) 7 , driven far into australian outback their father picnic . we've seen family ... children school , mother preparing food while she smokes looks distracted , daughter swimming pool their expensive apartment building , father businessman who stares out window her . picnic , mother stayed home . father preoccupied car . he stops daughter lays out food while her brother runs among rocks . shot rings out bullet hits rocks boy . father firing . daughter runs her brother scoops him up hide . he shoots them several more times , then demands they come back so they return home . after pause father pours gasoline car , ignites it shoots himself . children stranded middle scrub desert only what little food they carry . they start walking . they eventually find some muddy water fruit , but morning water disappeared fruit all eaten birds . they meet 16-year-old aboriginal boy ( david gulpilil ) who doing walkabout , months ' long initiation manhood where he must survive , or not survive , himself . heart story how he helps them survive , how he looks after them , how sexual feelings arise , how girl shaped her conventional attitudes unaware boy except someone who take them back civilization , how boy shaped his tribal rituals no other way express himself . climax boy feelings his attempt express them poignant sad . film , however , punctuated beginning end occasionally throughout shots civilized life which appear make civilization less appealing than primitive direct life boy brings girl her brother . butchering bring meat supermarket really any different than butchering kangaroo or lizard ? doesn't treatment aborigines children compare unfavorably resourcefulness cheerfulness boy ? isn't killing food better than using high-powered rifles kill animals sport ? movie oblique enough so these " civilized " moments don't overpower basic story , but they still there . viewing film now , they seemed unnecessary intrusions into what remains very strong affecting story two young people utterly unable communicate because their own conventions . movie beautifully photographed . two sequences stand out me . one , after days desert scrub , three find themselves walking through forest eucalyptus trees , palms green scrub . little brother trotting young man telling him long involved story boy ladder . not word understood but they both enjoy experience . other sequence abandoned , ruined farm house . young man painted himself dancing what appears ritual declaration girl . he can't express himself any other way she only show she frightened . he dances until he exhausted . morning she her brother find him resolution quite sad . this balance wonderful movie , me , hasn't aged well i thought it would . particular , john barry film score seems now far too lush intrusive . concentrate story two young people , however , you won't disappointed . it film well worth . criterion dvd picture looks just fine . there audio commentary , which i didn't listen , roeg agutter .	1
i rented this movie watched it last night--hadn't seen it close thirty years since i little girl -- nearly freaked deja-vous experience hearing quot ; you remind man/what man ? /the man power/what power ? / power whoo-dooquot ; . my older sister knowingly said , quot ; yes , tutorgal , this where comes . quot ; i used chant chant kid ! so much memory lane ; now down business quot ; bachelor bobby soxer . quot ; movie bit slow start , pretty static direction , up until point when high school student shirley temple sees ladykiller artist cary grant high school assembly delivering lecture . pow ! she sees him knight shining armor off corral him . she doesn't know course big sis judge myrna loy just him her courtroom formed low opinion his reputed womanizing . shirley even finds way gain access unknowing cary apartment , where he then unjustly gets slammed jailbait charge . hey , where this going ? well , myrna her assistant da beau rudy vallee decide only way shirley get over cary him date her probably bore her his adult ways . course , nothing works out like anyone planned , least all smug myrna . i wrote above , movie really picks up after 15-20 minutes then becomes quite hilarious , rudy vallee particularly good eccentric wasp , sort thing he so well . cary appears genuinely enjoying himself , shirley certainly grown real cutie . myrna okay , but nothing spectacular this time around . make date watch quot ; bachelor bobby soxerquot ; see whoo-doo first hand	1

much science this influential oldie-but-goodie very naive ; there goofy decisions serve only move plot ; we're left wonder why chief scientist thought this walking vegetable so intelligent superior . but fas t-t alking almost improvisatory style so popular decade earlier successfully mixes beginnings more campy 50s sensibility became template sci-fi movies . male lead unusually solid , decisive , likable ; female lead brightens things considerably her glowing humor . action mostly not very impressive , but characters well enough developed keep things interesting . definitely above average its type	1

bride white hair 2 followed quickly upon success original movie , taking up tragic story cho yi-hang ( leslie cheung ) his forbidden love lien ni-chang ( brigitte lin ) . betraying his sacred pledge he would never doubt his beloved , cho unleashed monster . ni-chang fury over cho betrayal drives her completely mad , transforming her into white-haired witch who lives only destroy every living member eight clans , especially wu tang clan which cho belongs . cho , he retreated mount shin fung , guarding over mystical flower whose bloom ( it only blooms once every twenty years ) cleanse restore woman he still loves . ten years passed since deadly night ni-chang went mad almost single-handedly destroyed wu tang clan . only two members clan survive : cho , who stood guard mount shin fung under blizzard conditions all these years , cho nephew kit ( sunny chan ) . kit impending marriage lyre ( joey maan ) , opportunity further bloodline exists - so it ni-chang crashes party , kidnaps young bride , takes her back her own private castle full man-hating , deadly women . there , lyre indoctrinated witch " see man , kill man " philosophy programmed kill kit her own hands . eight clans send their best warriors try kill witch rescue lyre , but they all almost defenseless against ni-chang , who uses her deadly hair most effective weapon ( sounds weird , i know , but it works really well ) . it soon becomes clear only person who might able defeat white witch cho yi-hang , this sets stage most unforgettable reunion two former lovers . this sequel more direct , action-oriented film than original bride white hair , reason i actually found it more enjoyable surface . still , though , it lacks depth beauty original , largely because two lovers not meet again face face until final scene - although meeting well worth wait . most certainly , if you've seen enjoyed original , you'll want experience this sequel	1

i love trouble lightweight romantic comedy helium-filled proportions . it effectively vehicle everyone favourite movie darling early 1990s , julia roberts , some fun look lovely while getting one up dastardly male lead played nick nolte . nolte plays peter brackett , veteran newspaper columnist respected chicago chronicle . ever ladies man , brackett little wrong eyes bevy woman he attracts , his loyal readers , even his grumpy editor . he manages fly seat his pants deadlines looming get his stories filed time , every time ( even if it mean plagiarising himself ! ) . just released novel , brackett hit book tour circuit , life looking good this charming , yet slightly sleazy bachelor . this course until journalistic competition , form lovely sabrina peterson ( julia roberts ) , comes her quick wit , sharpened pencil , keen nose story , obligatory short skirt . end , this film runs out steam ludicrous contrived ending probably 30 minutes too late arriving . actual train crash plot becomes secondary romantic battle two leads , which rarely sparks into anything other than light-hearted banter some clich�d one-liners . there plenty awfully large plot holes story , some wide enough fit julia roberts ' smile through sideways , you probably find yourself laughing out loud some contrived scenarios . if it effort recapture some past glories screwball comedies late 1930s , it failed miserably .	-1

when i think cary grant , i think suave , immaculate , debonair actor who defined cool his own era well our own . monkey business , delightfully funny screwball comedy 1952 , shows us very different side cary grant . blessed major talent likes grant , ginger rogers , marilyn monroe , lovably huffy character actor charles coburn , monkey business delivers good old-fashioned comedy start finish . grant plays barnaby fulton , chemist working develop age-retarding formula . ginger rogers edwina , his more than understanding wife ; she handles his absent-minded episodes grace style , putting his interests before her own every time . fulton boss mr. oxley ( coburn ) very anxious solution found , he already past retirement age , but some piece puzzle just not fall into place - not , , until one fulton lab monkeys escapes her cage , mixes her own formula , then stashes it water cooler . when fulton tries out his latest concoction , washed down cup water , he soon reverts back teenager mentality , running around like wild man even entertaining lois laurel ( monroe ) , mr. oxley secretary , afternoon . eventually , effects wear off he returns his normal self , but both he his wife conduct several more experiments ( both accidentally well purposely ) movie progresses , each them regressing farther farther back toward childhood each time . naturally , all these goings-on , big , zany ending store everyone involved . best part this movie childlike antics cary grant ginger rogers they carry some time like couple eight-year-olds . marilyn monroe stunning her character never fails produce laughs . lois , who begun coming work early each morning because her boss isn't satisfied her punctuation , not hired her secretarial skills , but , mr. oxley says , anyone type . marilyn gets fair share screen time this early film hers , but there no question cary grant ginger rogers thoroughly steal show their comedic antics . end , monkey business shows youth state mind , best expressed barnaby line , " you're old only when you forget you're young .	1
