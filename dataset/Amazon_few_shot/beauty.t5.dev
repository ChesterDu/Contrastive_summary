this shampoo made my hair flat dry when i used it every day . so , i tried using shampoo used jonathan once week . one day i used jonathan shampoo my hair noticably flat dull . i ended up throwing it trash went back my old shampoo . what disappointment	-1
used shampoo theory , my hair turned out worse than it ever . not recommended , least medium/wavy hair . no frizz control	-1
i excited purchase jonathan product after watching two seasons blow out . unfortunately , i really disappointed after using this conditioner my hair . my hair very thick after using this conditioner it left my hair sticky tangled mess . unfortunately , fragrance conditioner great but that it	-1
works good lip balm but i didt really see difference size my lips , wouldnt buy it again .	-1
shiseido known creating top quality products not irritate even most sensitive skin . my mother many my friends mothers swear their benefiance line . i cannot tell you how disappointed i am their pureness line . it oily/problem skin . i using this 10 days while it goes nicely this wonderful , light , clean fragrance , it made my skin even oilier . i thought my skin just get acclimated new skincare regimen but this not case	-1
this item smells like lemon pine sol . it not what you think you paying . its not worth money .	-1
i love trying out new products my hair also happen slightly thinning hair top my head ( receding corners ) . after seeing this set sephora i tried it week found results mediocre . my hair , which thin not very abundant , feel slightly thicker plump look roots ( especially crown ) but i am sensitive smell didn't like man cologne like scent . shampoo lathers up nicely but conditioner dense doesn't spread well over hair . mouse interesting . it definitely seems make difference volume . overnight liquid makes hair bit messy sleep . case any product , it may work you but it didn't me . i believe changing body/hair inside out works better than rubbing niacin ( vitamin ) topically scalp hair . i would recommend you try it . you always return it if you're not satisfied	-1
my experience this brush terrible . well , first two or three days wonderful . third day , brush shedding bristles like mad into my razor . second week , wooden handle ( which look durable ) cracked plastic sleeve holds bristles popped out -- never go back again . i am replacing this brush , sadly , after 15 uses , i purchasing more expensive brush , i hope better results . *** update , few months later : i didn't replace brush . i super-glued bristle-sleeve back into wooden handle . it eventually stopped shedding bristles , i used it successfully since then . wooden handle still looks like it deteriorate quickly finish continues chip off . still not recommended , since i don't think i should repair product within first few weeks use	-1
this stuff worst smelling conditioner i ever encountered . perfume penetrated my hair not able get removed . it took 2 days before scent calmed down enough it not bothering me its obnoxiousness . i wish i could give it negative rating . i am glad all i used sample not pay money make my hair stink	-1
i using product faithfully several weeks , usually twice daily not seen any difference facial brightening . i would not repurchase this product	-1
i received my order very dissapointed . skin tones online deceiving . i ordered medium it appears like clay ashy . doesn't blend well skin . suggest you order darker color match your skin tone	-1
i ordered gift set it came advertised . very cute package . unfortunately no one sells this product east coast ( i could find ) so i could not test it . it far too strong scent , even lotion . candle filled house scent 10 minutes . my advice , find someone or someplace offers this product before purchasing	-1
i've read so many positive reviews this i wanted buy it so very much . but when i got around actually smell it ... i so dissapointed , i only smell old lady perfume , bug spray , i don't know , something so strong not strong right way . my favourites dior j'adore , red delicious , intuition ( estee lauder ) , try them instead if you want feel sexy powerful	-1
i first smelled this perfume strip magazine . i fell love both bottle , scent instantaneously . i decided when i some extra cash i would buy it or hopefully drop enough hints get it christmas . christmas came went no fantasy , instead i recieved celine dion fragrance . i liked smell dion but still sad i didn't get what i wanted . i decided buy fantasy myself . upon finding it makeup counter i became rather thankful i got other . i think fantasy smells lot like this cotton candy spray i elementary school . mmmm smell like 4th grader again . bottle elegant , but scent juvenile . it'd appropriate preteens , but not grown women , then again , should i surprised ? i suppose scent caters well spears ' followers , 12 year olds	-1
i developed mild acne after deciding go off my regular birth control pill . never acne before , this devistating . i watched all infomercials decided go murad acne complex kit expecting glowing , perfect skin they promised within few short weeks . i purchased starter kit i liked smell products but after month half , i still experiencing bad breakouts . i even really painful acne so deep it takes weeks them come surface ! i continued use second shipment murad because everything i read said purging cycle could take 4 or more weeks . i spent 3 months over $60 this stuff without results . silly me , i going order more but i started reading reviews my only alternative , proactiv . now stuff isn't any cheaper long run but someone else mentioned acne free their review i figured it worth try . i found it my local walreens $19 . let me tell you , i used acne free 2 , two , days saw results i not seen 3 months using expensive stuff . i can't say enough it . i'm thrilled something so easy get would work so much better than any hyped up product . goes show , don't buy t.v.	-1

since i high school , so many women praised wonders almost lipstick black honey . i finally self-gifted purchased myself , all my expectations met . color initially scary tube , but very least swipe it your hand - you'll see it actually very wearable sheer brownish raspberry color . you layer it stronger color , or swipe it over lip balm make it even more sheer . resulting effect your lips , but better . color your lips improved they moist shiny looking . if you layer repeatedly over dry lips it very shiny deep red brown color . i've seen black honey worn fair/medium asian white women looked flattering every one them . lastly , product not smell . it no perfumes become disgusting day wears , nor it cheap waxy smell/taste . fabulous product	1
this soap unbelievable ! it leaves skin soft smooth no added chemicals	1
okay , so our moms said we shouldn't compare , but i couldn't help it once i found sephora powder brush . it hair handles above all rest . used think brush brush brush , which probably why my " rest " includes artificial haired brushes left powdered streaks my face one shed whatever kind hairs it possessed faster than sheepdog august . enough my sad cosmetic catastrophes - this sephora brush made 100% goat hair , fine soft pick up powder allow you apply either pressed or loose powder sleekly smoothly . i say it feels like silk your skin ? it . additionally , brush hairs rounded rather than cut straight across so it " quick " pick-up " consistently even distribution . course , it good looking state-of-the art silver handle . it measures 8 inches - more importantly , it measures up everything perfect powder brush should . - gail cook	1
this life-changing product if you any issues eye shadow creasing . you just smooth little this product your eyelids before applying eye shadow , it provides perfect base . twelve hours later , shadow still perfectly place . i bought this neiman marcus store , but product so good i wanted make sure i rated it online so others would know how great it !	1
let me say this best skin care cream i ever used i know fact it works because so many dermatologists stand behind it . i've used it little over year now i won't use anything else . i don't know last time i ever use exfoliating scrub because what this , automatic scrub . it gradually sloughing off dead skin cells you rendering use exfoliaters useless . i must say , it natural funky smell but you adapt very quickly won't notice it after while . you use it once day first two weeks ( while your skin gets used it ) then twice day thereafter if you want . i only use it night sunscreen throughout day because skin little more sensitive sun . caution - this acid cream . i once minor paper cut my finger ( same i use dip into pot ) i still get tears my eyes thinking pain i . this excellent cream i strongly recommend it . it won't get rid wrinkles ( you know there practically nothing market get rid them ) but it soften look wrinkles it give your skin beautiful softness glow . it amazing cream true genuine results	1
i loved this product so many years , but haven't found it more than ten . i flew spain evian absolute necessity ! it just right amount cool water opposed splashing water your face out faucet . it very refreshing , also brightens fading makeup .	1

this my favourite lush bubble bar . it makes lots bubbles good 2 very decadent baths . it divided into 3 or even 4 baths , but i like lots bubbles so i usually divide into 2 baths . it smells like vanilla candy wonderful . smell usually lingers lot longer bathroom than it me . i dark blue tub so can't really see if water changes colour . i think if it , it only faint pink . it strong smell but i think that part why i love it so much . candy flower top pink , blue , yellow , or white . if you like this i would also recommend you try melting marshmallow moment , which bath melt ( ie no bubbles ) but it also really yummy , lot more skin-softening . this also divided into least 2 baths , still indulgent	1
i totally disagree reviewers say it smells strong like granny ! i don't know what they're smelling , but obviously it not this . it smell little stronger first than it when fragrance settled , but it certainly doesn't smell like any granny i've ever smelled . i always get compliments when i wear this fragrance ( which every day)- complete strangers come up me tell me how good i smell . i recommend starting body emulsion then lightly spritzing fragrance ( 1 spray should trick ) .	1
some reason chicks dig this aroma . i've tried many clognes over many years but this gets best reaction . i'm getting more now request several ladies so i decided write this review . my luck they'll stop making stuff now so i'm buying 5 bottles just case	1

this perfume isn't comparible anything - finally totally unique scent ! it sweet sexy , scent changes you . i'm addicted it . so men ! ;	1
this fantastic product lasts forever , so relatively steep cost not so bad . this great product using under eye makeup , because it makes eye makeup slip better stay longer , or alone , natural but still ' pu t-t ogether ' look . i love this product more than mascara , haven't found anything like it other product lines .	1
forgive me rhyme , but sentiment true . this product rich , but same time light . after opening jar , i loved way hair honey smelled , it sweet aroma but i didn't detect " cirtus " smell product description . i am only sorry i didn't get larger size .	1
this product awesome ; nice texture , great tingling feeling , very smooth/clean feeling after use . but i'm not sure if you should use it daily , exfoliators should only used 2-3x/week because they're too abrasive . so just remember . otherwise , this definitley top notch exfoliator .	1
i am actually employee l'occitane ( pronounced lox-ee-tahn ; that question i get asked every day ! lol ) . i only working company their santa barbara store 2 weeks , this what i've learned artemesia shampoo : this shampoo all four season carry . packageing may seem different if you four season country , but this only shampoo ours they carry ( once while people dont believe me , but trust me- they train us which one it ) . people come everyday this shampoo because they loved it so much four seasons . fact , company sold out our store ( which ran out quickly because there four seasons santa barbara ) many unhappy customers because they couldnt find it . scent heavenly lasting your hair . some other products you might want try out ? four seasons also carrys our verbena shea soap , verbena body lotion , our lavender linen water ( which makes clothes smell great when used ironing ) . also , just let you know , this week we're getting new products our honey line ( btw- try honey body balm- i'm hooked ) including cleanser , milk bath , honey massage nectar . hope this information helps some you- enjoy !	1

i very fine , poker straight hair not dry or oily . then i got this conditioner big shampoo my hair regained it shine , but more importantly -- i got bounce ! i never any waves or body my hair before but this conditioner it . i used big shampoo other conditioners it not good me . i like big shampoo , but this veganese conditioner real key my newly bouncy hair . veganese just works perfectly me my hair never looked better . one thing -- i kind hate smell i not think it lemony all . it smells ... i don't know , too much like " granola girl " or something -- almost patchouli-like me . however it leaves my hair looking super , so really , who cares if it smells good shower	1
first time i smelled this intoxicating scent i knew i it myself . it heady , rich , very exotic , dark mysterious .... when i wear this perfume , i envision room filled beautiful brown skinned women dark black hair richly colored silks red purple covering their bodies laying around organza brocade covered chaises eating sweet dark fruit sipping red wine cobalt glasses	1
it definitely great moisturizer . if you're looking something thick but not greasy won't make you look like you're frying egg your forehead , this definitely it ! texture also makes it easy apply makeup afterwards . i use it everyday morning time after i wash my face . only thing careful , if you extremely dry parched skin exfoliating daily point where your skin aching , then try stay away this moisturizer until your skin heals . i overdosing my skin benzoyl peroxide , aha acids , retinol few months ago , leaving my skin extremely sensitive . when i put this gel , it would make my skin burn . but other than , you're safe using it daily regular normal routine	1
i struggling dry skin mild acne years . recently , i revamped my cleansing routine my makeup . i bought philosphy purity cleanser hope jar . it made unbelievable difference my skin ! my skin smooth , not dry flake anywhere . it soft baby butt . it worth noting little goes long way . you only need very small amount ( size dime or less ) your whole face . it very light texture , almost like mousse , glides over your skin absorbs quickly . if you use too much ( i first few times)then your face could look greasy . if you remember less more , then you get perfectly moisturized , yet matte , complexion . after using philosophy cleanser hope jar , i use bare escentuals mineral makeup ( bought light/fairly light starter kit ) . my skin , first time ever , flawless . no acne . no dry skin . no reddish areas . just perfectly smooth complexion . i keep looking mirror , thinking " this my skin ? really ? " i cannot believe what difference this product ( mineral makeup ) made . i heard others allergic some ingredients hope jar , so it not everyone . i suggest getting sample size make sure you won't reaction	1
i love this perfume , it best i my collection . it not too strong but it enough everyone notice . i practically wear it everyday , this size usually last while	1
terrific area around eyes . gets rid dryness , doesn't sting eyes or feel greasy .	1
these bristles just right combination softness strength . however , since i only use this back scrub brush , detachable design not optimal me . after few months , brush-handle attachment point became compromised ( probably all exposure water ) , i found brush would often detach handle i scrubbed my back . this point , many more months down road , brush no longer stays mounted handle all , so i am looking ( non-detachable ) replacement . even so , i recommend this product because it great bristles , also because handle great while it lasted .	-1

i recently started wet shaving ( within last two months ) come regard shaving something i look forward now . i use merkur futura double-edged razor bought assortment different shaving creams try , including prorasso ( italian eucalyptus stuff ) , taylor bond street ( avocado ) truefitt hill traflagar . my top choice trufitt hill hands down . while many people might see $22 expensive , most people need realize very little goes long way . this not like edge gel or barbasol you learned shave . this just requires dab wet brush ( real badger hair brush ) swirl small bowl sitting bit hot drawn water create warm thick lather make you enjoy shaving again . i would estimate this jar last 6 months . looking cost my new shave method ( 52 blades year ( $0.50 each ) , two jars shaving cream year ($22 each ) comes $70 year . compare this blade every other week alcohol-based shave gel ( which dries your skin ) every other month cost $60 . ten bucks more year buys much better shave . i've noticed my shaves take bit longer , but my skin cleared up many bumps i used . i also no longer 5 o'clock shadow 3 afternoon . best all shave closest thing i've ever shave i got barber florence , italy using steady hand scary looking straight blade . this best bet shave cream !	1

( i can't even tell i'm wearing it , except excellent protection all sun rays . ) now i wouldn't without it ! although price $36+ , you only use tiny bit , it lasts long time .	1
pure poison sensual mysterious scent nothing short invigorating . but it something i would only use during colder seasons just because weather brings out scent more pleasantly . spring/summer , i would recommend sunflowers elizabeth arden .	1
i fine hair , this nothing make my hair oily or weigh it down . it helped emphasize my natural wave eliminated need heat-style . plus , no frizzies ! one thing keep mind : this pre shampoo treatment , so make sure you use it before you shower then wash it out . your hair shouldn't get too greasy if you wash it out . you also warm little your hands pull through your ends hydrating styling product . smell little " unique , " not bad exactly , but you always wash it out your favorite-smelling shampoo . however , whole line ojon good , so i'd recommend shampoo , conditioner , styling cream too .	1
i'm really anal scented/flavored lipglosses- especially ones scented or flavored vanilla , but mac lipglass isn't vanilla-ish all ! it got very pigmented color , it stays long time gloss , each tube lasts long time ... don't let what other reviewer said vanilla scent throw you off	1

i hesitant spend this amount not see results . well , proof pudding , so speak . strivectin works . i much heavier one point my life , i stretch marks show it . while they never really bothered me before , i thought i'd give it try , summer around corner . i'm just 3 weeks use they fading . literally . while they haven't vanished completely yet , i am quite happy results . they drastically faded so far , lost ' silvery ' look before . they recommend using this product up 6 weeks i plan doing just . simple easy . guess what ? you even use this product your face ! they make claim it " better than botox " i would agree . something you normally , like putting lotion far healthier , simpler saner . although it doesn't bother me ; minty scent could bother some people their face hence they've released non frangrant eye creme . love this product	1

i love lush - always ordered it amazon we no local store . this means it hit miss me i cannot preview scents . this one hit !! this one their smaller bubble bars , but still plenty two baths jacuzzi tub . smell yummy hollywood style bubbles - you know kind pretty woman !! lush pricey , but i never bought any other product makes me feel like i didn't fight get bubbles - like pouring half bottle . if you haven't tried lush before , this one great starter !	1
if first you don't succeed ... play around until you get better result- different approaches seem work individual lush users . like most lush products , ocean salt scrub may take little getting used ( may behave differently depending what type water you ) but it lots fun play delivers good result . probably not people who want streamlined beauty routine accomplished fast , but if you like play ... scrub smells looks amazing vodka/citrus combination definitely helps dry up blemishes . i sensitive skin this helpful once week usage- any more than my skin gets tight irritated begins flake . one final note caution : this scrub serious when it says ' salt ' , so don't use it or near broken skin . bath body works started using sugar their scrubs this reason , but salt great effect clearing up problem skin tends help where things aren't seriously broken	1

these replacement sponges dermanew system . each sponge includes foam top section comes contact your skin plastic bottom section snaps securely your dermanew applicator . sponges very effective applying dermanew dermabrasion creams . very gentle skin just right amount pressure . each one also lasts long time if you clean it after each use . but because wear tear bacterial growth they should replaced periodically . dermanew system great ! (see my review it ) sponges excellent . however , i deducted one star because i feel $4.00 pricey item .	-1

this razor best virtue me its ability cut thick beard without clogging like multi blade cartridges out there . i always dreaded shaving after hunting or fishing trip . even old gillette twist-open requires it partially opened properly rinse out cream whisker sludge . this guy nice round cavity underneath each cutting edge allows water wash everything away . even shaking it bowl clear it most time . if it should clog , one blow it out quite easily . i only used lower settings , they all i seem need good blades . gillette blades sold us horrible , btw . use merkur blades or swedish gillettes best shave . my only complaint alignment marks match up top body faint , adjustment marks not line up properly , i am forced math get repeatability . i higher expectations german engineering price . this thing overpriced what it , but good shave worth lot , you only buy it once	-1
this best hairspray i've ever used ! it goes fine mist , dries fast , so you shape you hair , then spray again set it . it not stiff , yet hold amazing i very hard hold baby fine hair . it not cheap , but once i tried it , i can't live without it !	1

i am also fanatic sandalwood products searched world ( literally ) same . i found this brand slightly different than one might expect sandalwood , but still very pleasing . little pricey , but not more than expected sandalwood . i've also tried their after shave , soap , shampoo . i've very satisfied all these sandalwood products continue purchase them until i find something better .	1
i love this foundation . i warm sand moisture rich foundation . it incredibly smooth , long wearing color makes my skin look bright radiant . bobbi brown makes very natural foundation colors there range colors all different skin tones . when i'm shopping it seems most lines cater lighter medium skin tones , but bobbi brown really come through flattering options all skin tones . only draw back this foundation not provide adequate spf protection , even though it says spf 15 . therefore , you still need wear sunscreen underneath least spf 15 . i use this foundation every day i wear sunscreen paula choice ( which i love ) . i think color options available , long lasting color smooth texture make this foundation worth price .	1
this very complex scent , mellows after wearing awhile , but still leaves subtle scent quite while . especially effective worn body lotion shower gel	-1
i happened go neiman marcus over my lunch break check out some new lipgloss yves saint laurent counter ended up bobbi brown counter . sales lady talked me into letting her put rouge my cheeks color - pale pink . wow it made me look so good . it made me look like i glowing or flushing inside there no telltale marks blush my face . i bought it spot . this not great effect my lips , it looked like i lipstick , but i'll just use it my cheeks . i highly recommend this product .	1
