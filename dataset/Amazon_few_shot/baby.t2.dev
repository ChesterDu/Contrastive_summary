this product not safe product should not used your child . not only it give additional padding not intended , nor tested your safety seat , but it also voids warranty safety seat . nhtsa ( national highway traffic safety administration ) government agency sets standards child safety seats states " after-market products " should not used . it also not meet fmvss213 standards stated manufacturer description	-1
this high chair great start , but after while tray table would come loose one side during meals . i thought it me , first , not latching it correctly but we soon realized it my 9 month old releasing clasp . reluctant change chairs we persevered now , 3 months later , she remove both sides entirely send tray its contents crashing floor . i am worried she either trap her fingers tray comes loose or bruise her legs tray falls ground . if you looking chair last you into toddler-hood your child learns quickly , don't buy this one . i am looking replacement before my daughter hurts herself	-1
before i even opportunity use this product , it disappointed me . i washed this item per manufacturer instructions . bottom pad came out drier all pilled . i wonder how many more washings this pad stand . truly disappointment	1
i received this sheet immediately disappointed . quality very cheap it wasn't perfect fit . i am surprised this made graco - usually their products good . i would not recommend buying this . i would buy regular crib sheet instead .	-1
after my husband i put this together using terrible directions , we've using this free-standing bassinet past 5 months ( not attached bed , some people ) . my daughter sleeping it just fine . however , we attempted fold it up take it us weekend away home recently . what nightmare collapse ! again , directions absolutely no help . it impossible get whole thing into carrying case get it zipped up . also , this thing weighs ton . i now realize i need buy something else use when travelling . how annoying . bottom line : if you're going set this up never take it down , it fine ( once you initially get it put together , ) . however , if you think you'd like use this occasional overnight trip away home , forget it !	1
i got this swing i talking it back . i put it 5 it not move . i don't know what it would like baby it . i just tryed it .	-1
this stroller great year half . my only complaint until now sunshade .... it doesnt block much sun when up falls off when down seems always catch things when folded ... but i could deal how light easy this stroller . it easy steer one handed when needed folds down very compact . however , now i am suddenly problems it folding while use . it it both my 2.5 year old my 9 month old , so its not related weight . every time it happened i right there , so there no injuries , but i am leary put my children it now . i contacted chicco told , " sorry , you out warranty " their products carry 1 year warranty , i purchased mine year half ago . i only gave 2 stars because it 4 or 5 star worthy until it started folding its own ,..... otherwise i would try give it no stars . every mom wants feel their child safe , i am now uneasy safety this stroller	1
don't bother , it doesn't fit all !!!!!! plain simple ... just don't bother	-1
we also ordered bedding got pillow . we called baby age they nice but refused honor price send us bedding . they should know there problem now change this listing	-1
shoppers beware : item itself great item but i received worst shipment ever my online orders : 1-even though item advertised amazon new , i received item which previously used apparently long long time . rocker seat dirty smelled . 2-even though seller charges more than 9 dollars shipping , they not bother put manufacturer fragile box mailing box . therefore package arrived cut several locations some items bulging out . 3-some accessories missing i bet previous owner forgot return them	-1
ditto other complaints - won't separate easily- either unscrewing or prizing . cheap , flimsy , leaks water also because no gasket . i'm looking something else hoping reviewers give honest good advice . . . this almost identical product munchki	-1
i this used it 5 months . i never problems it starting , but it drives me crazy dripping all over counter amount condensation . i am looking new sterilizer because this . i not recommend .	-1
$52.00 less weighted down cash , i my way what most expensive non-video monitor available local target . surely most ridiculously expensive all highlighted bubbles beside features like " clear reception " " no interference " i would able hear baby every move every household location beyond . we hooked it up short order , turned it , * screeeech * . apparently volume level might permit us hear baby one room away would also cause some sort massive interference monitor reciever . we tried shutting monitor off , plugging second kitchen outlet - entire length house away . no screeching , but it sounded like someone speaking inside tin . totally distorted , useless . you couldn't tell if baby banging her crib bars or if someone moving heavy machinery her bedroom . we've packed it carefully back into box , hoping target take it back without fight . needless say , i'd steer clear this one . our $20 safety first monitor far surpasses this one - even its last leg	-1
i bought this hoping it would help my newborn calm down or sleep same way hair dryer or vacuum cleaner work so well . this thing doesn't white noise sound but i thought maybe womb sound might work . however volume not even close loud enough compare hair dryer . it just become toy my older child who likes play other sounds .	-1
i brought this gift my son his wife ; their daughter born 2/21/07 . when i questioned them why they not used bottle warmer , they just didn't get around using it . i insisted they read directions start using it . next day , my son stated . wow mom this best baby shower gift . they could not believe how fast bottle warmer worked . how much timed it saved them new parents , milk heated just right temperature each time . my son so thankful , i insisted he use product	1
this wipe warmer more trouble than it worth . water resevoir would not hold water kept leaking all over changing table . result wipes would dry out warmer burnt wipes . i emailed manufacturer regarding this product see if they fix or if my product defective . they failed respond	-1
i agonized over whether buy this cheaper pump or go straight one high-end ($250+) models . effort save money i started this one . but i quickly realized i'd made mistake -- it took * forever * even get one ounce milk . i ended up getting medela pump style loved it . i just wish i'd gone straight one saved my money this one . those you who trying decide this or more expensive model , here my two cents : try this one if ... - you very abundant milk supply- you only plan pump one or twice month- you wouldn't mind giving your baby formula if you away her extended periodinvest money higher-end model if ... - you're going back work- your milk supply medium low- you plan pump more than two or three times per month- you opposed giving your baby any formula , ever ( higher quality pump you could build up reserve breastmilk case emergency)also , it worth noting most more expensive models safely re-used other people so could sold someone else when you're ( unlike this one )	1
i thought these would great , but could never get them work right . sometimes they would flow sometimes not . i would take bottom off make it work then remember put it back after using them or dump it all over . many pieces , much trouble , i would upset my baby would also ! switched avent loving it	-1
this pump refered me hospital where i my first son . so since i got it used it . my breast hurt worse using this pump then when i engorged . it one worst experiances . i under impression this suppose help day day new baby . i connot recommend enough not use this one . i am know expecting again looking pump . i know i not go hospital recommendation again	-1

i bought dual room imonitor yesterday . ( only available store babies us ) . it same one shown here , but it two transmitters montor two children . based only 4 hours testing , i am taking unit back . pro : -the range great . whole house , plus 800ft outside . -no interference . i live dense suburban area many sources interference . -easy setup . -shape/size parent units much better than others ( especially sony)cons : -controls not very straightforward . -the unit always hisses . it not sound/voice activated . -the power switch parent unit button not recessed . when you turn it off , it not beep or let you know you . button easy bump , would make it easy carry thing while it off , you think it . -the deal breaker : power outage requires turns off child units . even short power interruption , child units come up " off " mode . you go baby room turn them . until you , parent unit beep flash red . we using sony 910 3 years our first child . i guess it spoiled us	1
i two double strollers , 1 front back graco this side side aria . i don't use front/back graco much not able both children sleeping same time ( 2 1/2 year 1 year . i peg mt single first loved it . so thought product quality would same . used it 2 years no problems . but say stay clear aria design . our side side numerous pieces fall off , cup holder , seat clip , logo tag , clip hold trays place , etc . its not durable all ! we even close it using pen one side due clip you lift left side falling off too ! we took it plane trip last week sworn whole stroller off . my sister law single same problems product . she since bought maclaren single i am process purchasing maclaren twin techno . it may cost more but it would alot cheeper buying it first than second	1
when i saw this tub , i thought wow this great . it everything . well after receiving tub gift my shower i decided try it before baby came . i am so glad i . pump spa shower super loud leak . shower very difficult operate , i press really hard . only thing i loved tub sling . it very nice . i think when it comes buying tub baby simple better ... beginning speed key , baby gets cold really enjoy features this tub . my opinion get simple tub splurge something else .	1

very useless pants . i bought them tried them my toddler twins they not work all boy or girl i buy correct size . they even leaked when used over diapers night . they bascially nothing	-1
i started my newborn out using avent bottles . after few weeks , she began crying alot . you could hear gas moving her tummy , every time her tummy would grumble , she would pull her legs up shriek pain . she would also pass gas constantly . it so difficult feed her because she would cough , spit cry whole time . then she would miserable gas pains hours afterwards . i tried switching formulas - didn't work . tried mylicon , zantac , gripe water , bicycling her legs , etc . etc . etc ... nothing worked . pediatrician diagnosed her colic said there nothing we could , she would outgrow it . finally , we decided switch bottles ( i switched playtex nursers . ) instantly we noticed difference ! she extremely quiet during feedings , didn't squirm or cry ! she began ingesting almost twice much formula per feeding(probably because her tummy too full gas take any more avent bottles ! ) would go longer feeds . when she swallowed , it sounded different - you could tell she no longer swallowing air ! something those avent bottles made her swallow tons air . i think it suction created inside bottle she ate . playtex nursers , liner inside bottle contracts she eats , eliminating any air bubbles . she completely different baby now . she more alert interacts us much more because she spends less her awake time crying . so if you decide buy these bottles - beware . if you already using them your baby colic , switch immediately ! don't just assume colic " normal " or " outgrown . " babies don't deserve suffer this way !!!	-1
this item packaged very poorly . you literally rip box apart open it . i this twice , both times very last item completely cracked half . very inconveniently shipped packaged .	-1
i bought this my grand-daughter , here my daughter reviews how this product working ( or not ) " hmmmmm .... she loves music more than potty itself . we listen dance " potty " song everyday- but there little progress actual potty . i think way go her may attachable seat goes top real toliet . otherwise she carries potty around room room treats it like seat . i think getting something looks more like real toliet would worked better . or perhaps she going thru phase not over yet , so maybe she get into it again after few weeks . thanks , anyway . " i don't find this very encouraging , so i wish i purchased something else .	1
i thought i would love this but just returned it . it hurt my neck so badly after only wearing it short time ( 10 minutes ? ) maybe i'm too small ( 5'2 " )or my baby ( 5 months 18 pounds ) too large . either way i still find bjorn much more comfortable . i would like something where baby more sideways my hip like this than either facing me or facing out so confined he bjorn , but i couldn't stand wearing ! very painful	-1
i purchased earlier version this product two years ago . i disappointed i wasn't able use it my second pregnancy , most likely because it dropped too many times . this new version comes cloth pouch makes it much more user friendly . also , one set batteries ( 4 aa ) lasted 4-1/2 weeks . batteries my old one would last 5 days if i lucky . my daughter just turned two january 06 extremely smart , verbally advanced joy around . 16 months she knew all her colors could recite abc . 18 months she could recognize all letters . i believe we well our way reading child age 3 . i credit baby plus ? who really knows but we decided not chance it using it again baby #2 .	1

i just bought this one top stairs pressure mounted gate bottom stairs . my first impressions pressure mounted gate fine bottom stairs . however , gates which attach walls screws way more sturdy than even best pressure mounted alternative . we considered this model evenflo " top stair gate " . after inspecting both gates store we opted this one because wood spindles evenflo seemeed less sturdy potentially prone breaking . if one spindles breaks you replace entire unit . also , why take chance safety ? anyway , here few things consider when installing this item : 1 . i took advice others only used template swing side hardware only . this must . it would wall-damaging crapshoot try get both sides lined up exactly right using templates both sides wall . 2 . unless you screwing hardward into banister don't want damage them screws go all way through , use longer screws than dinky 1/4 " 1/2 " screws provided kit . i went 2 " screws additional strength . 3 ) installation isn't big deal . just take your time avoid silly mistakes result extra holes your walls . i found picture-based instructions back booklet far more useful than word-based instructions front booklet . it wasn't five minute job but it not hard all . i'll back few months post my thoughts gate after it some wear tear our 11 months old son our 100lb dog .	1
i love my new native sling ! i used it so many times find it very easy use very versatile . my baby very chubby guy 9 months he 24 pounds still fits sling . he loves it too , whenever we out shopping or even home he little fussy i put him sling he calms right down snuggles . i've even nursed while walking around .. many places : costco , disneyland , walmart ! very discreet . i also love fact it small enough fold up put my diaper bag , so i always it . no bulky rings or padding . i'm buying them all my family babies ! i love it , i've gotten lots compliments it . must item ! ericawashington stat	1

after reading some reviews i felt compelled share my experience this product . i love it ! i'm not sure if they made different model before , but mine on/off switch works just fine ( its back ) . its not rocket science if you follow directions . i never problems bottle floating . if you put bottle first then fill warmer water like directions tell you , then bottle won't float . warmer itself chart it tells you how long leave bottle warmer what setting . it also light flashes off when warmer reached constant temperature . there no " dings " or timers , but hasn't presented any problems me . overall this product what it supposed it it well . first time mom , i highly recommend it .	1
i lot online store researching before i bought this seat my 3 1/2 year old son . my one concern my son very slim all reviews talked how seat worked well larger children . well now i say it works well slim ones well . he loves arm rests cup holder . it light weight so easy move fold when necessary . we liked it so much we going buy one when our 2 year son son ready transition	1
my little guy loved this start . this versatile toy lasted many months . mat machine washable , so it became our take travel . hanging toys rings detach so you rearrange them variety take them anywhere , such car seat or stroller baby grows . he now 2 yrs , mat still wall hanging his room ! this great investment	1

these really good bottles . i using them 4 weeks now my newborn son . my only complaint regard stage 1 nipples they come you supposed use newborns . flow much too slow . my little boy could not get anything out it he tried tried . so if you plan using these bottles , i would recommend going ahead using stage 2 your newborn baby . i am not only person who this problem stage one nipples . other than , these bottles great	1
i bought this item based previous reviews recommendations not disappointed all . i love color , material easy wash , most all it keeps my baby warm comfortable . i bugaboo cameleon stroller it fits perfectly . my only recommendation would parents purchase toddler size rather than infant size if your baby older than 3 months . bag runs rather small so size labels decieving . other than , what you see what you get ! worth every penny !!!	1
i bought this pump after avent isis failed me electric pump . fact this pump puts so much control over suction power my hands great . im able empty each breast 15 min or less sometimes . although its little loud it manual pump all manual pumps little noisy . reading other reviews i think alot other mothers expected results this pump just arent reasonable . remember most manual pumps arent constant expressing purposes or bringing milk supply . if you read tegh package manufacturer even says they recommend pump emptying breasts occasionally like when spending time away baby or breastfeeding moms who express once or twice day so others feed baby . they discourage it working moms who pump everyday .	1
we britax roundabout our daughters so very pleased them , especially safety ratings . when my older daughter ready booster , choice easy -- britax ! my daughter loves her booster . when i first got it mail ( we live overseas ) i initially disappointed because i thought she wouldn't like side supports , but she loves them ! i would like comment two previous comments .... boosters not faa approved shouldn't used airplane . boosters use shoulder seatbelts . second , you not secure booster down because it not carseat . it used because children under 8 80 pounds too small shoulder seatbelt . i simply want comment those because britax makes great .... safe product	1
i very pleased when i saw just how beautiful this car seat . now my daughter 3 months old i feel i give it review . i read many things complaints but i just don't any . everything works well it . it doesn't fit well all carts but carts weren't made baby carriers fit them so it not bad thing car seat itself . all infant carriers same problem . i recommend this anyone who wants infant carrier likes how it looks . it pretty fits great it stroller . all all , it great buy . although my next time around , i'm passing up infant carrier going britax . they're much safer imo what i've read heard	1

i my doubts when we first used it b/c it closes just some toggle-like buttons i worried wind would slip through . but my baby comes out this stroller-sleeping-bag/wrap warm every time . we've few days this winter here northeast way below freezing wind chill strong enough sting your face .	1
i tried several different bottles , including avent second nature , this only one my baby could get good suction didn't flow too fast or make her gag . nipples same pacifier given me hospital ( which only pacifier she take well ) . i am breastfeeding , all trouble i findnig bottle , i worried what would happen when i went back work my baby fed bottle . this bottle eased my mind . also , wide neck make washing easier than any other bottles . reason i am not giving it 5 stars because it leak if top not really tight , but long i make sure it tight i no problems	1
this great item , but , it some flaws . i got this my 2 month old , he loved it ! now he 6 months loves it just much . thing , you need manually push button , then you use remote . after it plays all music , it shuts off , only way turn it back , press button yourself . not great when you're flying freeway ! but , it still seems calm my baby soon music goes	1
this seat caught my attention because higher weight height capacity , 29 inches 22lbs but this seat also very well made padding exceptional compared evenflo graco every where padded head rest additional egg shock support it comes additional body pillow newborns , until pillow gets snug you remove it.my daughter 13lbs 8 ounces 25 inches her 4 month old wellbaby check up june , now six months old she still fits not hanging out all . i wonder if previous reviewer removed body pillow . it get snug then you use seat without pillow . why not five stars ? instructions bad seat much easier install without base . but good seat overall	1
my daughter breastfed , but we introduced bottle around 3 weeks ensure she would take one ( pumped milk and/or formula ) . we originally bought avent bottles no problems until all sudden 2-1/2 months she went bonkers ! refused drink bottle . granted we bit lax giving her bottles ( not every day , but least once per week ) . i tried dr. browns it same problem . it didn't matter if it breastmilk , forumula , warm , cold , room-temp , etc . she just screamed ! during this time , she using platex ortho pacifier , but begun using soothie pacifer i got hospital . she didn't like soothie pacifier all begin ... took several months her like it . anyway , i randomly freebie soothie bottle motherhood maternity drawer i thought i might well try . she took it immediately !! i since bought several more preparation daycare , she still takes them no problems ( she 4 months now ) . i not any problem leaks , fact she stays much much cleaner this bottle than she avent . my only problem , there no disc put underneath nipple when transporting or mixing bottle . however , stage 1 nipples pretty slow , so long its kept upright it okay . i using my old avent bottle sealing discs milk transport pouring into soothie feed .	1
i researched many breast pumps line before my daughter born . after she two weeks old , my milk supply established , i decided purchase pump . i read many reviews isis so skeptical ... i didn't want pay $300 automatic one . i enjoy breastfeeding so much , however , i am not comfortable nursing public not mention pumping allows my husband feed her too . after much thought , i decided purchase isis amp ; quot ; back workamp ; quot ; . it came pump , bottles tote ( which way very discreet ) . i no trouble assembling it all . first time i used isis i've great success . i am able pump several ounces 15 minutes , without any pain or discomfort i control suction . our daughter not any problems switching bottle breast all , nor we ever experienced bottles/nipples leaking . i assemble pump nipples/rings when they just out sterilizer still wet . i love how easy this use i don't find place plug it work . only thing i've noticed little gel packs don't stay cool enough my liking so i went purchased 2 little ice packs ( . 90 cents ) they work like charm ! i would recommend this any mom !	1
i highly recommend this item . soon your little one sit up his own , this must all moms . it fits all shopping carts ( except costco , but including target ) well those icky high chairs available restaurants . it keeps baby ( mommy hands ) touching cart handle prevents kiddo wedging his legs wrong hole cart . must ! this gift i give baby showers . i've over year it survived many washing touch bleach . still looks good	1
our son especially strong startle reflex , swaddled sleep , all . 2.5 weeks , he startled able get out any swaddle we , no matter how expertly , no matter what blanket we used . so , 1 hour sleep , he'd start crying we'd go start all over . we searched online actual " swaddling " blankets based reviews , chose this one . what utter miracle . we such debt dad who created this ! our son now 12 weeks old , we use this each nap nighttime sleep . he sleeping 6-7 hour stretches 5 weeks , slept 11 hours 8 weeks . we would never this success without this blanket . we've periodically tried get him sleep without it , but his reflex still so strong he needs it . it took little " getting used " method get him wrapped up , but no time we both experts . price amazon , free shipping , way better than what we paid directly through amb . i wholeheartedly reccommend this all parents , especially new parents .	1
i 2 activity centers different makers ( other grandmas house)so i something compare this . i honestly say this this activity center worth extra 15-20 dollars you might spend . begin , seat swivels easily baby move one activity next . might not important issue older babies but my daughter 4 months old when she started use this compared other exersaucer , it really makes differnce seat she maneuver . toys attachments great quality offer variety skills baby learn entertained . i can't say enough positive things this activity center . i highly recommend it it both stimulating entertaining baby .	1

this sort product wasn't available my first child . it such pain get him into winter outerwear , even more pain take it off when we got where we going . when i found this bundleme product , i knew it would much easier survive winter months michigan my second child . it fits easily into my graco infant carseat/carrier . i don't worry dressing him up , i just put hat him off we go !! it also easier buckle baby up without so much extra clothing bunching up everywhere- probably safer too !! when we get where ever we going i just unzip sides he fine . so far we endured 40 degree temps , rain , wind snow he stayed warm snug bug whole time !! truly excellent purchase !	1
this tent not easy pop up manufacturer claimed . we fussed it while before actually figuring out how it . no intructions came tent . second time we tried open it one spines broke now tent useless . $100 it shouldn't broken easily . when we it up first only time , however , it great . our nine month old son loved it . i sat center tent while he crawled laps around me , chasing some little plastic balls . he liked hearing crinkling tent fabric he moved across it . tent need pegged any kind wind , but this easy . reviewer said tent hot , but we're hawaii where there always least breeze it fine . there also slit one wall tent which allows wind pass through . i'm going try contact manufacturer lack instructions relative fragility tent parts . if i am satisfied their response i order tent again . it really great once it set up . however , i more careful when opening it try find non-windy place it .	1
i recently purchased this seat my 1 year old daughter used it last week beach . chair easily securely fit chair . tray stayed attached , unlike other models i tried . my daughter enjoyed many meals her new seat . cleaning it breeze packing it travel . this great seat great price	1
i decided potty train my son using just potty topper stool . he really loves things all himself just like mommy daddy so i figured would work best him . no matter what i he continued accident after accident . we would sit bathroom long periods time he would always pee after i took him off potty . i decided getting him his own potty seat would enable him sit potty longer periods time , infront tv or living room , family , or his room . i thought it might just thing make him understand so i went internet pick one out . i picked babybjorn potty chair because simplicity design , easy clean up deflector . most seats very small deflectors or none all . some deflectors don't stay put . i also liked designed stay floor not slip , slide , or get stuck child . day this arrived my son three consecutive accidents spite fact we spend most day bathroom . i just give up put him back pull ups when it finally arrived . he scared first but i told him this his very own new potty chair second he sat down he peed it !!! i let him take pot big potty dump it me it ! he hooked . i didn't even need encourage him anymore or harass him sit down . he would just run right over pee then declare " i it !!!! mommy help me dump it . " he only used this potty chair only one day but it definetly what he needed get idea . very next morning he said he wanted use big potty now never looked back . we use potty chair now outings . it great ! easy clean easy bring car !!! i would given 5 stars if not fact deflector just bit low . if my son wasn't leaning forward watch himself pee it would close call . there few reviews stated their child legs squished because deflector so wide ... my son 3 2 months he big boy top 75 percent height weight he fit fine lots room spare !!! only thing concerned me when i read reviews .	1
what previous reviewer didn't realize there 2 different packaging options this item . first option pack contains 1 key 2 locks people who want try it out second option buy pack contains 4 locks but no key those who already bought starter kit happened like product . so make sure you really read description what you're getting if you're buying online . ( this one happens 4 locks no key so you might want try starter kit first ... i actually rec . it because unfortunately lock doesn't work all situations because draw designs ) then top kidco also sells key seperately no locks those who product , love it , happened misplace or lose their key or want purchase additional incase they ever lose 1st key . i admit i think it pretty lame company try squeeze every penny out you especially when it probaby only costs 5 cents make darn key especially when you're dealing child safety products . far how well product works ... i love it wish it worked out better all my draw situations ! it especially great those cabinet doors stand alone don't door next it where you just buy one those wrap around door knob locks require 2 knobs side side . i didn't great luck my kitchen draws because draw panel added actual draw so it isn't flush where you put catch . i put 5 stars bring rating up because last reviewer only gave one it actually great product . i know it outsmart my baby far beyond any cheaper options out there . i installed them adhesive tape comes it but i plan reattaching it screws also included because i personally feel screws better job because i love my child more than my freaking cabinet doors all those worried messing up your precious wood cabinets ... i mean give me break ... holes so small anyway it totally concealed , only you know it there . also , this locks so tight little fingers/hands can't reach inside small openings ( which usually occures other types locks ) pull stuff out . also there option turn lock off kids . definitely consider this product !!!!	1

this great tummy time us ! we started using it right away , both tummy time just lying baby against . it really seemed help our guy hold his head up look , 3 or 4 months he reaching toys while holding his head up . it also handy propping him when he started sitting up , i used it 6 months when we starting doing solid foods prop him up instead highchair . we totally got our money out this item , it packed up ready next one	1
i bought this my baby when he month old . he now 4 months old loves it . i never change batteries yet . he doesnt pay much attention lights or movement so i just it set play music sounds . he impossible get sleep without it . even if i am staying somewhere else him , this must pack ! it i feed him , bathe him , lay him down , push button leave room . i rarely go back start it again he falls asleep it so quickly . i only hope when he gets old enough activate it himself he doesnt stay awake just watch it .	1
i must agree i tried others - cheap expensive - before finally getting dr. brown bottles . i tried others same claims - even few gimmicks would work theory ( ventaire ) . i only found success dr. brown bottles . these bottles sometimes leak - until you get hang them keep inner-tube empty collar not-so-tight . usually gentle twist collar empty inner-tube then you twist it back ... but not too tight . disks help stop leaks during travel , but you really just need work keeping them upright . yes , more cleaning - thank goodness microwave sterilizers . i simply handwashed then boiled first child , but love my microwave steamer now . markings fading some my bottles , but i believe hand-washing saved them little . i compared avent ( which only slightly cheaper - but lots " transition sippy cup " type advantages ( or breast pump straight bottle ) . i still love my doc brown complaints scratched off markings applied other bottles , too . i personally preferred wide-neck because they seem fit my baby better , but several friends like standard . we all agree doc brown lifesavers , though . i give 3 pk 8 oz size every baby shower	1
this actually pretty good ! i use it warming breastmilk formula . it took few tries get it perfect temperature , but i never too-hot milk , so my baby didn't get hurt . there few times where milk wasn't too warm - but didn't take long . my measuring cup markings rub off after 2 months , i contacted munchkin they sent me new one free .	1
we recently purchased this mattress 3n1 natural crib . no problems noted mattress ; however , our son ( who now 6 weeks old ) doesn't sleep crib much just yet ..	1
this tub excellent transition tub baby too big those little plastic tubs , but too small big tub . it spacious enough our 11 month old play ( he big 11 month old ) , provides nice soft sides so when he slips he doesn't bang his head hard sides tub . we got deluxe toys , but i think they more entertaining me than him . i wish we skipped traditional plastic tub went straight this . great buy	1
these toys great . easy use . they even taught my 2 year old how not only blow , but i think it indirectly taught her how blow her nose too . toy years come tub .	1
dr. brown bottles best ! we tried everything else wasted lot time money ... not waste your time buy dr. brown bottles ...	1
this warmer must . it stops most squirming fighting over changes(once your child gets past newborn stage ) . wipes nice warm , but not shockingly hot . i would suggest adding 1/2 cup water container if you live dry climate . i like this model because it not built night light ( eventually light become attractive toddlers ) . it also works very well any type wipe , pop-ups singles . i wish they portable ones .	1
it simpler than i thought it would . no diaper sausage like diaper genie . we use scented bags curb smell little extra . i would definitey recommend it anyone	1
we love this carrier . we live seattle need carrier all kinds trips we both happy this purchase . i am 5'2 my husband 6'0 we both use it ease very comfortable us our daughter . just fyi you really need 2 people put it take it off safetly . carrier massive storage . very good all around carrier . very good price !	1
my baby developed feeding issues including unique mixture colic reflux made feeding times nightmare everyone our house . we started out using playtex drop-ins system worked fine us until we 1.5 months old . then suddenly there lots gas screaming feedings . i switched playtex vent aire bottles screaming stopped , but there issues nipples just wasn't working out us either . baby spending more calories than she taking level 1 , drowning level 2 . plus there wierd extra parts clean keep up . it temporary answer our prayers but still not what we looking . because we preemie , changing her formula isn't option because she needs nutrients this special formula we giving her she continuing gain weight . so real issue become trying make feeding more comfortable her us . final resort ( i spent so much bottle systems didn't work out i almost given up ) , i gave avent feeding system try . it worked wonders . baby eats appropriate amount time now , there only standard parts any bottle clean manage , baby tolerates nipple flow well ( we use both level 1 2 nipples ) . best all special " variable flow " nipples , sold separately-we use those feedings where we mix rice cereal they allow cereal through , not too fast but no clogs either . i like not " alter " flow regular nipples toothpicks , etc . because once you this , there no going back . variable flow nipples solve problem leave other nipples unscathed normal feeding needs . also , our baby addicted soothie pacifiers hospital . we tried nuk , mam , gerber she wouldn't accept any those . but she accepting avent pacifiers included this newborn starter set . my advice parents looking bottles help with/solve feeding issues-buy smallest number possible give it 5 days . if it looks good day one same kind good day 5 , it safe sink more money into it . but if it isn't going work out , it obvious day 5 or sooner you haven't found " answer " . avent bottles passed this test us i would highly recommend them . additionally , if your baby experiencing colic or reflux , see fussy baby dot org tips ideas . also i would recommend specific brand gripe water called colic ease ( all brands not same , see their ingredient page see why ) . fussy baby site this gripe water teamed up avent bottles really helped us out work through our feeding issues . good luck	1
works great . easy use . just bit costly but worth money	1
we comparison-shopped booster seats while , found this greatly superior anything we've used past . price higher than other booster-only seats ( no lateral head support ) , but additional safety factor well worth it . this second this model we bought , so now both active boys ( 4 7 ) ensconced them	1
i didnt monitor my son so i wasnt sure what expect . i thought there would lot more background snow but there isn't it very clear . we vaporizer running all time there but when my daughter cries , her voice very clear through vaporizer sounds . only thing i wish monitor little more portable , maybe battery backup . minor inconvenience . 2-way speaker awesome . when i shower she starts cry , i calm her little conversation get couple minutes dry off .	1
works well banisters . great thing it you remove it when you guest over night when babies asleep .	1
i first bought this swing 8 years ago when my nephew turned 1 . he loved it , it his best birthday gift . since then , it become our standard one-year-old gift . i've given it dozens children received rave reviews every time . when friend bought this my son first birthday , we thrilled . he his friends now nearly four still like swing it even though they mastered big-boy swing . my one-year-old sit it watching big kids play garden he mover - not like sit still all . it also perfect days when ground too wet crawl around ( which seems like everyday lately ) . way , i read ' upside down ' post . i concerned tried turn mine upside down without child it ropes balanced i could not turn it even empty . family may defective ropes or it installed improperly ..	1
i use this top my son dresser short viola ! it changing table . i've never any problems it we've using it almost two years now . i highly reccomend it way i use it ( without actual changing table ) or one i'm sure it works too .	1
this pop-up bin hold anything including soiled laundry , far too many stuffed animals , up 2 toddlers ( though not recommended , i'm sure ) entire contents family coin jar!it pretty durable versatile . ours survived all sorts trials put upon my almost 3 year old it still looks new	1

after my 20 month old figured out how " escape " , i felt this option best i knew if we put him toddler bed , entire family would up all night hearing him scream gate . pros : really works even hard-core escape artists , made well , makes me feel much better knowing he safe . cons : can't hang any crib toys , can't use " ultimate crib sheet " ( which one best baby products ever ) , your child hate it first , mesh kinda rough so my little mad one red " face burns " rubbing it . biggest downside : too expensive !!! i feel since this company , far i know , only one making this , they feel they charge this much just b/c desperate parents no other option . overall : love product , hate price	1
my 7 month old used this daily since he 8 weeks . he loves it even more now . he grows he finds new ways play gym . he loves music lights especially . he play his own 20 minutes least . this lifesaver me , i use it occupy him while i get ready morning , or any time i need distract him , or just put him floor play know he'll stay one place . i would highly recommend this anyone . i think it one piece baby gear i absolutely would not give up	1
initially , i going get toy box my 10 month old daughter . then i decided she needed extra space her room crawl around i didn't want worry piece furniture she would bang . i saw this product store bought it . not only it cheaper than toy box , its space saver , its portable , its light so you carry it its contents room room , you put alot things into it . baby loves colorful design i love fact she won't get hurt if she bumps into it . also , it zips up top so you seal it . i recommend it .	1
i got this my sister her new born boy . like any new mother she afraid leave baby alone even minute . her able leave room go bathroom or get something drink or get mail still keep watch baby - such mental relief . her her husband . picture very good quality . she no problems interference other devices same frequency area .	1
i really like all product haba , especially this mobile . they made germany high quality materials , sweetness charm lot us products lack . i love colors too . only thing this mobile little unexpected it doesn't come arm hang edge crib . instead , we hung it ceiling some elastic . worked great	1
i love this seat because it works different types toilets . it not move around like some them . this third seat i tried , but just not happy other brands . this one great worth paying little more .	1
i bought this set my baby when she 6 month old they quickly became her favorite . she box full small toys/rattles but she always ends up grabbing one these . i like how flat they which makes it easy tuck one into small diaper bag so she musical entertainment when we're go . my baby approaching 1 year still intrigued them . i anticipate years fun this toy . great purchase	1
overall i love this carseat but i found out today i driving around handle wrong position . i kept handle what instructions refer position which also setting you carry seat . after speaking police officer recently trained certified car seat installation/safety , he said handle absolutely needs far back possible provided very strong arguement why . manual came seat very ambiguous not specifically say this all . i called graco suggested this statement added book safety concerns she argued seat " tested " handle up it fine . officer i spoke adament infant could grave danger if handle up crash . i think i am going believe police officer vs . manufacturer !	1
our baby getting fussy . we started gas drops nipped problem bud . then couple weeks ago , feeding time turned into battle zone . screaming , back arching , twisting writhing , spitting formula while passing gas , burps sending formula up air . we desperate . so i ran out bought these bottles . good : moment we switched , screaming stopped . hooray ! we still get little screaming if we didn't get bottle assembled properly we leaks , it seems slightly harder get burps out baby , probably because there less air going so it takes longer build up good solid burp . bad : these bottles 3 pack only come stage 2 nipples . flow those too fast , baby drowning . i bought bunch stage 1 nipples whoa , we went 125 ml per 30 minutes 45 ml hour . i tried letting baby build up her sucking strength these stage 1 nipples 3 days , then finally , out desperation , came here read reviews see what others say . i bought narrow dr. brown level 1 nipples . baby sucking evolved time i got those home , unfortunately , she sucks so hard after used these crummy playtex stage 1 nipples she drowns some more when we use alternative nipples . this solution would worked well i got these nipples day we noticed how slow stage 1 playtex nipples . needless say , i thoroughly read through instructions since screaming stopped i able process information again . it recommends you bring nipple tip where hole closer where baby lips come together , meaning , don't allow more than 1/2 nipple baby mouth while she sucking . this worked perfectly we now back 100 ml 30 minutes . ptl ! ugly : addition needing stage 1.5 nipple desparately ( come playtex , puuuuhleeeez ! ) , parts bit awkward . not like dr. brown , but you nipple , ring , bottle , disk , vent cap . lots pieces clean keep up , but easy handle if they keep your kid screaming you hours end . also , you not supposed use bottle warmer this . guess what , i tried it anyway . sometimes bit formula leak thereby requiring cleanout bottle warmer . but it isn't too bad we using bottle warmer anyway , seems working out just fine us . take my advice-assemble bottles while baby sleeping , you can't slap these things together during screamy baby emergency or you mess your hands ( everywhere else ) . bottom line our baby eating again . so i would recommend , i just take away one star bad/ugly portions my review . edit : these bottles temporary answer our prayers . however , we switched avent bottles they worked great us two weeks now . my advice parents looking bottles solve feeding issues-buy smallest number possible give it 5 days . if it looks good day one same kind good day 5 , it safe sink more money into it . but if it isn't going work out , it obvious day 5 or sooner you haven't found " answer "	1
this good buy me . baby wrapper ideal newborns	1
i wish more people knew this storage system . it so convenient - pump straight into liners , twist caps , store fridge or freezer . once milk frozen , pop off caps , pop out liners store them freezer bags . when needed , just pop liner back into nurser it ready go . bottles heat quickly easily hot water . it so easy clean pieces - just soak hot soapy water minute rinse . i bought 4 or 5 storage systems - i bring 4 caps work , send 4 bottles daycare , several bottles stored fridge or freezer . my son , almost 5 months old , no problems bottle-feeding playtex nursers naturalatch slow flow nipples . highly recommend !!	1

i love thi sling many reasons but top three following : 1 ) my baby calms down right away when she carried it . 2 ) she doesn't get scared strangers when we visit new people or go party ( she middle stranger anxiety phase ) . 3 ) most all it helps nursing really discretely public without ovrheating my baby . before itried use all kinds blankets scarves but my baby getting so swaty hot . instead fabric maya wraps very breathable my baby remains comfortable temperature , even texas	1

" i highly recommend this all !!	1
years ago my first child , i learned hate those clich� , oversized diaper bags , especially when most my outings short errands . why bring what amounts piece luggage those short trips ? this diaper bag ultimate functionality brief jaunts , holding truly amazing amount stuff , but holding it stylishly , boot . it may look small , but i carry three or four diapers , small container wipes , change clothes , nursing shawl , burp cloth or two , spare baby socks hat , teething ring or two , snack , my wallet , keys , palm pilot , tube diaper rash cream , few other odds ends there no problem . there lots zip compartments keep it all organized . i get lot compliments it , which strange considering it diaper bag . fact , woman stopped me store other day wanted know where i'd gotten it , because it " exactly purse she'd looking " -- she shocked learn it diaper bag ! it sporty enough my husband 13- y.o. son don't mind carrying it , either . if you're going day trip , you'll need something bigger , but those typical " quickie " errands , you can't beat this bag	1

good : 1 light weight2 mesh/breathable fabric warm weather3 handles tall enough woman heels , or husbands . 4 nice colors5 easier steer than other stollers . ( use 1 hand)6 folds flat carry handlebad : 1 too light put your bag or purse handles , tip no baby it . 2 doesn't recline3 sometimes 5 point harness takes more effort unclipoverall , this good investment . turns out most parents end up using thier compact ' umbrella ' stoller way more than deluxe , super gadget stoller . it so much easier use these simple light weight strollers , than their bulky , wide , heavy counterparts .	1
