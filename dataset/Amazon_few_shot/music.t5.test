cheap trick second album very disappointing me afterthe good , but raw , " live studio " , 1977-76 recordedcheap trick . almost all material here so watered down it really comes off way better later many live disks they . after good start w/ " hello there " , concert favorite many years , only thing here write home when one considers how great all tunes this overproduced album sounded budokan other live recordings later . tom werman rick niesen show 1991 i hadrecorded tape once werman , noce friend tom petersson said , quote : " my three albums cheap trickgot better better ... " , which ever sarcastic ricknielsen said , " selling , maybe . " not realizing brotherrick slamming him , werman then continued , " exactly " ... oh boy . we now see why producing cheap trick albums throughthe years become like playing russian roulette . it nothard get better than this five months later solid , but somewhat oeverrated ' heaven tonight ' came out ... ( theguys even bought werman back dream police . things turned out better when pete comita , then later jon brant joined theband . yep - best yet come - ' 80 '	-1
hooba ... stank ... stinks always stink . i don't know rest cd , but listening reason pleasant sticking your hand into running garbage disposal . i'm not perfect perrrrsssonn . egad	-1
bad news i wasted my time listening this whinefest . good news i bought it used . i give it two stars because there two tolerable songs cd she cutie . more good news . i re-sold it my purchase price	-1
much i like most songs this cd ... it just too short . also production lousy . recording quality sounds awful places . hopefully , updated compilations better . this one not worth money !!!	-1
this cd isnt real good if you like compilations than get ruff ryders	-1
best rb band ever !!! i know some disagree me , but this band really rock my boat . i mean , they awesome it wasn't forced or fake . rawness their funk sooo addictive you never put this cd down . i am process getting all their cds , but this one great way introduce their music	1
i bought this my kids because i knew they would love these songs just i . forget them ! i love it ! there nothing like chipmunks never again . christmas song worth price alone . don't think it . just get it	1
well , i think there two roles history opera after interpretation maria callas it would not unwise claim they should not performed again : norma bellini ( all recordings she ever made ) la traviata verdi ( definition role lies london 1958 traviata- unfortunately , her 1953 studio recording cetra almost unacceptable considering how she developed role violetta after 1955 ) . although i very rarely sit down write review amazon , after read so much mme callas , i feel it my responsibility fan this great art named opera make following points : a)maria callas not interpreter . she creator herself placed same rank donizzeti , bellini verdi . it not her i doubt opera would exist today if it it would sad , boring musuem exhibit . she recreated whole italian opera -not just bel canto- modernised it way make it last 100 years aftet her death . i remind you opera 50 meant german opera . italian opera before mme callas something joke . terribly abused singers bad tradition horrendus vocalising , music italian composers lost its drama , its sense , its meaning . b)why people spend so much time judging voice this great artist ? why they not just relax enjoy this great artistry ? o-o ne says there no other great singers ! but no matter how great , they unfortunately just : " singers " . caballe , sutherland , sills , price , fleming , dessay all amazing voices great carreers . but , comparing them phenomenon opera what mozart classical music simply not them justice . c)whether we like it or not norma dramatic soprano role ! very difficult one well it should treated some respect . caballe sutherland , because they these amazing voices , manage sing it they sang it well . but , they not dramatic sopranos they conveyed lyricism their interpretation simply not suit role bellini intentions . other attempts however ( sills -alas- gruberova recently)should really remain textbook examples how inflated egos ridicule both theselves work art . i repeat norma dramatic soprano role . this sense only singers approached callas perfection elena suliotis ( decca reason expediency or stupidity not reissuing her marvellous 1968 recording del monaco ) jane eaglen sony muti recording . only singer seems taught callas legacy bel canto mme renata scotto but she well inadequate norma wasted much her talent singing ( commercial reasons , i suppose ) puccini . d)callas very unlucky far supporting cast concerned . 1960 norma recording only exception . it features amazing franco corelli . what voice this man ! pefect voice , perfect dramatic conviction , beautiful clear italian diction . we imagine callas -corelli partnership aida , pirata , manon lescaut ? e)callas not lose her voice even though she overworked it 50s . 1964 tosca recording best proof . but she lose her confidence emotional stability . this fact led her quit her carreer 1965 real tragedy opera . she managed work hard 60-68 period when all her worry ar . onassis we would left least 10 amazing stereo recordings . i say 68 because someone like callas simply would refuse play young soprano roles after age 45 . she believed opera singers like ballet dansers or athletes ( they ! ) , they should retire early . mme sutherland voice till age 60 . so ? it not ridiculous singing la sonnambula age 59 ? if callas she would not legend she ! this all i wanted note woman achieved fame world opera ( beyond !!! ) way noone else before i am afraid no one else so future . people sleep pavements three days three nights get ticket this lady !	1
everything went smoothly this purchase i really enjoyed cd . it one my most favorites ones i highly recommend it everyone ! thank yo	1
keeping cuban tradition , my family likes very spooky halloween october 31 . we didn't know how make it very spooky , so we borrowed this cd friend who doesn't like halloween . we played it our halloween party everyone so scared . it though we real haunted house ghosts spooky things . i reccomend this anyone who wants very spooky halloween	1
i bought this cd little over year ago , already huge fan gang four entertainment ! album , i eager hear what other sounds this band store me . i drove out amoeba parking lot , i chose hard/solid gold out many purchases i made night listen first drive home ( place no small distinction ) . words can't describe my disappointment -- rather than hearing band even similar one i heard entertainment !, i instead got some cheesy post-disco 80 pop clearly same singers gang four i knew loved , maybe even some similar guitar work , but all all , left me feeling flat empty it faux motown backup singers drum machine beats . if i wanted good version this sound , i would purchased new order album . rather than attempting return this cd ( it used purchase ) let some other poor sap pick it up continue cycle disappointment , i threw it back my car , where it fell under seat remained over year , occasionally enjoying company gum wrapper or spare change . i knew quality band output some ebb flow , but i didn't want this sound taint my love entertainment ! album . although i realized time this cd two albums it , i naively figured whoever put package together would put better album first . thus , if hard placed beginning , then i didn't even want bear witness supposed horrors would lying wait me solid gold . . . what foolish mistake . last week , i found cd under seat my car decided give it try . sure enough , first few tracks hard sounded just miserable i remembered , but when i skipped ahead track 10 , " paralysed , " first track solid gold album , i found gang four i knew loved . here next logical progression after entertainment !, original lineup featuring andy gill guitar vocals , john king melodica , hugo burnham drums , dave allen bass . even artier weirder than its predecessor , solid gold everything i wanted this band , pushing formula newer greater places . taking cues more entertainment ! tracks like " anthrax " " not great men , " opposed more melodic numbers like " return gift " ( great song ) , " i found essence rare , " " glass , " solid gold what sophomore release band should . describing why i like solid gold bit challenge . . . it somewhat indescribable aesthetic , but if you listen way gill scrapes his guitar strings end " cheeseburger , " burnham stuttered beats songs like " what we all want , " unbridled energy " outside trains don't run time , " king direct , often staccato vocals liberal use melodica , interplay bass drums , or way each song picks you up , then you'll get it . if you liked aspects entertainment ! pushed envelope bit , you should get it too . also , lyrics still great , continuing touch themes like urban alienation , slavery work , social politics , gender issues , general confusion/obsession inner workings failings human social interaction . many others already astutely observed , countless bands owe debt gratitude maybe even few royalties sound gang four forged entertainment ! solid gold . there whole slew newer , soon forgotten bands carry gang four influence like badge ; earlier ( better ) rapture albums certainly borrow bit . o . 4 ., course we currently see many other anglo-beat bands ride trend well . best batch , longest potential , not u washington d.c. , developed sound bears many similarities well , especially when they use melodica . indeed , there plenty others , too many list , who don't necessarily fall into this niche , but borrow certain aspects . o . 4 sound approach-the minutemen , mission burma , fugazi , name few . anyways , what you still reading this ? get out there , pick up copy hard/solid gold , immediately skip track 10 , enjoy !	-1
this cd little more bluesy little bit soul than first one but john mayer music still best any new artist ever . you love it	1
i work my way through various grisman amp ; garcia collabarations i continue astounded amp ; elated . i am particularly taken w/this disc . it much celebration their musical powress their friendship . this disc first several volumes arranged grisman according genre . these traditional folk songs amp ; ballads . grisman releasing them showcase garcia musical depth amp ; breadth . same could said grisman artistry . many songs here i heard first time but definitely not last . accompaning booklet lovingly crafted . history each song presented lyrics . grisman amp ; garcia friendship allow us connect simpler amp ; purer time very much part our legacy . always acoustic disc quality heard fully appreciated	1
this recording less accessible than their later echo echo , but it rewards patient listener . carbon leaf gift ability create gorgeous soundscapes perfectly reflect lyrics each song . gift full flower here , result album coheres whole . expect need few listens before it worms its way into your head , but once it , you'll never forget it	-1
super score . two standards genre : hey there hernando hideaway , but also number outstanding production numbers duets : quot ; seven half centsquot ; , quot ; steam heatquot ; , quot;i'll never jealous againquot ; , quot ; there once manquot ; . most singing excellent but sometimes i admit janis paige isn't pitch i prefer ( dare i say it ) doris day movie . john raitt professional he always . this 50 musical through through , filled serious love songs , comedy satirical bite , endless energy . extra tracks this cd nothing too wonderful , excerpts pretty banal interview composer jerry ross , but they include song you won't hear ( good reason -- despite inteviewer mike wallace glowing support it pretty bad song ) show . want know why this show so good : george abbott , john raitt , bob fosse , harold prince , adler ross , eddie foy , jerome robbins , carol haney , peter gennaro . yes , there shows power-packed line-up like , bad , but not many . enjoy memories this bring back	-1
this release ambitious ( so much better than rap/hip mon ami bon ami release few years back ) - it scritti . there few moments get too precious , beatle-wise ; however total it one very few perfect listening experiences released this year . i just wish green still young blonde . what remarkable talent . makes you think wonder	1
you know how old nintendo games , your score would get so high hud no more space set your score back zero , so you so good you accidentally sucked ? that like opposite this album , which it fails so miserably ( except real american ) almost every area it reaches impossible level greatness . there just something really funny roddy piper screaming stage crew turn off their music because " it giving me damn headache !	1
i dunno why this album so cheap , but i figure they just wanted more people hear good music it . lots bang your buck , these some great songs if you like college rock kind stuff . i guess it kind reminds me strokes . doesn't really sound like though	-1
why earth , given hundreds songs rod could record this era .... he choose certain songs he cannot possibly enhance ? " love hurts ? " so my ears after hearing rod soil perfect nazareth song . " everything i own ? " bread ? rod , could you not gain access partridge family catalog ? " if not you ? " rod , olivia newton-john better interpretation dylan .... 35 years ago ! " still same ? " what sad , fitting title this collection . sad part , thousands sheeple buying this dreck , giving rod license steal yet again . i gave it 2 stars . there two songs aren't bad . first single , " you ever seen rain , " note-for-note remake ccr song can't topped , but rod version safe listenable ... perfect today ac radio . eagles ' " best my love , " which like most songs this collection , way overplayed already , good arrangement . rest either awful , or background noise . rod should embarassed . but course he isn't .	-1
how group fall far they ? " who you trust " " big calm " both classics ( dispite fact they sounded totally different one ) . now " fof " it just went down hill ... never came back	-1
no diss , just myself ... this only album i could not get , jigga let me listen his third it better than this album right here , but good if you got all common albums	-1
i originally discovered this album several years ago while working children radio program i used dj produce . i really enjoyed listening music , but leave cds behind when i left show after moving out city . now i currently am back air internet radio show , i've looking around some good quality halloween music play my new show . there really isn't much out there . lot halloween cds you buy compliations songs rearranged different artists or studio groups . that not case halloween hits . there only 10 songs album , but they all sung original artists . some them halloween favorites , such quot ; monster mashquot ; quot ; ghostbustersquot ; while others related frightening/scary/monster themes shows , such quot;addam family themequot ; quot ; twilight zone themequot ; . it would nice if this cd few more tunes it , but less than $10 , it basically bargain . good cd play halloween	1
problem making " best " album mr. hiatt would same making one john prine or tom waits . all written hits many artists but none one their own . devoted followers always bemoan their favorites left off . but cds like these aren't true fans . they uninitiated . this respect this fine album i enjoy immensely . i own few john albums am glad four my favorite songs them included but real treasure here finding gems i've never heard . this artist great songwriter enthusiastic performer . this cd showcases both aspects quite well	-1
this cd so boring . sarah mclachlan written / performed songs before set people alight her passion , her intensity , her hurt , etc ... these very tired renditions all-too-familiar christmas songs . sure , i stomach kenny rogers christmas , some reason it just seems make sense . but sarah mclachlan putting out christmas album seems nothing more than combination not new material her own needing some more bucks . excuse my frankness , but this album very disappointing	-1
if you're fan carlos santana , paco de lucia , al dimeola , tomatito or any other flamenco-inspired music this cd must . dvd ( 2.0 5.1 )included vida worth purchase price . unfortunately there no samples here amazon , but you go del castillo website listen .	1
you know you some blues when you see album titled " springtime kill you . " but what kind blues we getting ? not broken-hearted , misfortune blues , instead we get what i would call dysthymic blues . jolie sings , klonopin flavored slurring phrases , blues brooding , help-rejecting gloom . blues more than situational . rather sense cheerlessness wrapped up character , blues can't easily cured because her self-pity too important her , too protective . rather than replaced , her sadness , if taken away , would leave her gaping void could only filled uncontrolled anger anxiety . these songs give us sullen blues fueled anger world observant accurate , but no less self-defeating it . i'm not knocking her . i'm just expressing vibe i get listening this album . none this matters , she not my sister , not my friend , what matters if you like music . i . musically , i like her . she good musician , her songs creative . this isn't music i could listen all time , but it music i enjoy when i'm certain heavy-lidded , tranquilly-low frame mind resonate her attitude .	1
i only came across this cd because i remembered line " i'll " wanted find out what song it . when i came across edwin mccain , first thing popped into my mind , " who he ? " i never heard him before . however , after listening some samples listed amazon reading couple reviews , i went ahead bought " misguided roses . " let me tell you , it not something i've regretted . woodwind player flute , alto soprano saxophone recently clarinet , i am very interested instrumentation edwin mccain uses his songs . " i'll " interesting saxophone melody ( which you most likely would not noticed radio ) . addition , " darwin children " ( song you completely fall love if you fan " i'll " ) uses baritone saxophone main feature song . woodwind voice adds certain quality music you won't get other rock bands . " misguided roses " cd good long car drives , or anywhere , matter . when you're listening edwin mccain , there no need keep skipping tracks - this cd good whole way through . unlike some muisician[s ] ..., edwin mccain wrote all songs cd himself , adding certain respect his work . " misguided roses " cd everyone should ! i definitely reccomend it . like me , you wont regret buying it	1
this one my all-time favorite cds . i loved all songs this cd except one . my favorite " black girl pain " it should anthem inspriration black women all over globe . i pleasure seeing talib concert few months ago atlanta his live show even better than his cd . true hip-hop lives	1
wonderful cd but not perfect , few things . first all , let me state she not country or pop but defies definitons . some best performers can't classified she no exception . that one many things i like mindy smith . i love songs out lout , tennessee , i'm not only one asking long island shores . i'm not thrilled little devil i really don't like what if world stopped turning . aside those 2 songs this cd amazing , i would encourage anyone check it out . her music so much better than almost anything else around	-1
way , this cd good , way , it bad . " disneymania 4 " definately isn't best " disneymania " series , but isn't worst either . i think disney messed up songs like " supercalafragilisticexpealidocious " (turining it into rap ) , " bahama roller coaster ride " (which isn't even disney song , it supposed hawainn , not bahama ) , " monkey uncle " (which disney actually allowed pathetic youngster group like devo 2.0 sing ) . some better songs " dream wish your heart makes " , " zip dee doo dah " , " look through my eyes " , " you'll my heart " , " if i never knew you " . i wouldn't highly reccomend this cd , but absolutely huge fans disneymania series , they might want this .	-1
ned burst into " alternative rock " scene god fodder , brilliant debut effort , one best 1991 . " grey cell green " " happy " picked up local radio station , but entire cd spills over raw power . few songs cd ( ex . " kill your television " ) taken their earlier independent label issue , re-mixed here blended match theme cd . energy god fodder similar linkin park " hybrid theory " - fact , if you never listened ned , i would suggest this cd like mix nirvana linkin park . unfortunately , ned atomic dustbin later cds never reach level intensity this album , feeling overproduction , though they manage minor hit " sleeping around " .	1
when i bought this item , i not involve this disney euphoria , my 8 years old daughter ask me buy this cd , once cd home , i just looked her eyes , confirm me i just right thing . priceless	1
i won't say there aren't couple songs i don't fast-forward when i listen this cd .... but general , this one most extraordinary pop albums made so far this century . fact it made 5 years ago truly amazes me . i'm totally unaware cartoon-aspects band nor i any idea who legends behind this work . may or not interesting others but what truly impressive here boldness which this crew saunter through mish-mash styles attitudes almost always deftness purpose cunning .... yes .... some straight-up kicking joyous sounds . there no less than 5 classic hits here which deserve really tuning stereo up ... i mean way up . this rock pop hip-hop dub most extraordinary nature . mcc	1
first two bonus tracks undoubtedly kbfh broadcast gig capitol theater , passaic , new jersey august 30th 1980 . they sound same broadcast , clincher , billy name-checks venue , if you listen . ' la grange ' wasn't part broadcast , afaik , so that dropped elsewhere . ideally , i like know exactly where bonus tracks come , so i tempted dock them half star ! thanks these reviews below , i now know what i listening before cd wasn't mix originally released , which shabby way treat fans . i'm just retrospectively miffed : must so annoying those you who knew it wasn't real deal . ( kiss ' creatures night ' , only remasters sequence giving us mix running order i grown up . i couldn't play original cd pressing , which easy spot wrong era cover , so i empathise you long-time top fans . mind , i've now fan 22 years , come think it ...	1
me llen� de emoci�n cuando supe que habia aparecido esta grabaci�n , accidentalmente . 49 a�os han pasado , desde que se realizara en el carnegie hall , en new york este concierto ben�fico que pasar�a la historia del jazz como un evento hist�rico . escuchar dos m�sicos que son parte fundamental en la historia del jazz , es algo que nos emociona los amantes del jazz . recomiendo ampliamente esta grabaci�n la considero como el cd que no debe faltar en nuestra colecci�n .	1

recent covers albums go , this good one : it aces out cat power concept tori amos sheer consistency . concept this time out isn't sex but " real love , " kind soulful , abiding love not only goes into choosing our mates but also our favorite songs . greg dulli choices eclectic they come . but bless his heart , dulli rocker , one last authentic ones we've got . he digests tricky trip-hop , cabaret-electronica , smoove rb , even jazz , delivers pulsing heart all his song choices good old , electric-guitar-driven rock . but this ain't your daddy guitar rock . this sinuous , layered music , seen through dub-gauze , darkly . sometimes " she loves you " seems emanating directly someone dreamlife , sonic flashbacks chill-out room . mark lanegan , author last year excellent " bubblegum , " pitches back-up vocalist three tracks , but he really just here out comradeship ; this dulli show all way . daringly , dulli uncovers sadism always latent billie holiday masochism truly unsettling version " strange fruit , " he finds comfortable groove bjork fear-of-commitment " hyperballad . " but album two showstoppers tense , surreal " too tough die " ( not ramones song ) , very cool , slightly lounge-y arrangement " black color my true love hair " which just keeps revving up more , which almost great bowie similar heart-pounding treatment " wild wind " ( off " station station " ) . she loves you ? yeah , yeah , yeah .	-1
bee gees one greatest gifts music loving public . group took two paths during their career beginning early ' folk ' like sound through ' disco ' period 70 80 . my preference early stuff such " ny mining disaster " , " first may " " words " . this very fine 2-disc compilation very well put together but ignore some albums . example there no track 1981 " living eyes " . title track this one their finest ballads singles year , while second single " he liar " interesting , although minor hit . one my all-time favourite bee gee hits " spirits flown " . yet ommission , but let face it .... it impossible fit everything two cd . this still fine effort worth your collection .	-1
i am far tech-head , but i would like think i recognize good beats any genre . songs like " just " " traffic " trace-like but still very danceable . i think his blend etheral vocals good background beats really show good number these songs .	-1
this fine band chicago created fabulous album . it very rare indeed find band which fuse good tunes , excellent lyrics rich varied use musical instruments but i am happy report frisbie band . where other bands content repeat chorus ad infinitum , frisbie seem take song make it change pace direction several times . album starts upbeat note quot ; let gets startedquot ; . once you hear first few chords this number you realise you treat . quot ; pollyannaquot ; second effort very pleasant indeed . if you want good example song changing direction , listen quot ; shinequot ; which changes pace mood near end . quot ; paid kindquot ; very strange song indeed speeds up slows down several times . it this song you start hear use trumpet which makes appearance several songs very rewarding hear . quot ; marthaquot ; pleasing ballad which includes what i think bassoon ! quot ; see seenquot ; superlative number which my opinion one highpoints album obvious nod big star ( very similar quot ; back carquot ;) . quot ;d isasterquot ; fine song . then comes what i believe best song album quot ; momentitoquot ; . song everything - 12 string guitars , john fogerty-style vocal delivery trumpets . 30 years ago this song would recorded byrds ! next two songs quot ; hifalutinquot ; quot ; booksongquot ; both strange hard figure out but testament band originality . quot ; vertigogoquot ; classic three minutes pure pop some great harmonies . final song quot ; shufflequot ; banjo it great fun . all all , this album absolute gem should listened every opportunity . frisbie supported matthew sweet recent tours us i pray they come ireland future i think they magnificen	1

definitely their most commercial album sense most people probably their best . nothing ever touch master puppets my opinion , but beginnning end this top notch album without single weak track . if you're diehard metal fan never listen anything else , you might want avoid this one stick pre-black albums . however , if you love solid hard rock/metal album this one handful must own	1

this cd wonderful collection toby keith earlier songs . recorded when toby keith still fully country , before he became more cross country rock . this cd includes hits such " should've cowboy " , " little less talk lot more action , " " you ain't much fun " many more . my personal favorite " he ain't worth missing " . but every song good one i think this cd easily enjoyed any country fan	1

' best ' great update their earlier ' greatest hits ' album . this c.d. provides more highlights mixes songs better , overall . unbelievably , it adds two more classics ' bridge over troubled water , ' but still doesn't make purchase original classic redundant . " hazy shade winter , " " zoo , " " fakin ' it " welcome additions undoubtedly better appreciated than their original release . ( significantly , these songs played oldies stations more now than past . ) their vintage hits don't fool around , either . none them seem old , really . unlike dylan , they comfortable spare , folk music they ethereal , pop production . " sounds silence , " " feelin ' groovy , " " homeward bound " excellent folk . " dangling conversation , " " scarborough fair , " " boxer , " " bridge over troubled water " exquisitely crafted pop masterpieces , " i am rock " " mrs. robinson " folk-rock perfection . if you haven't given enough , then this c.d. rounded off their reunion finale " my little town , " which surprisingly only clocks three-and-a-half minutes . generosity selection make this c.d. must those who love timeless music sixties early seventies .	1
i say keane take coldplay sound but there several differences . if you like coldplay you , probably like keane . i not like coldplay , i find it sounds too mopey me . keane improved upon coldplay sound better vocals more upbeat sound very enjoyable ( if derivative ) sound . it interesting keane used keyboard/piano instead guitars create their emotional feeling . my favorite song ' your eyes open , ' it build up sound emotion , great song . overall great first album	-1

painful hear painful watch . yester-year pop singer who doesn't courage quit . there nothing left so she keeps throwing out pointless album after pointless album stay spotlight ; if isn't highest form egoism i don't know what . she got fame she got fortune she her hits why not just go now please ? what she use shock value early days now seems so trite pathetic . woman nothing more then spectacle very little substance . she uses anything sex religion self promote . yes i fan days like prayer vogue but i moved , why madonna doesn't come same conclusion i never understand . this cd good flavor month but its shelf life way past due . i challenge madonna put concert without all antics overt sexual malarkey dominates her shows ; she would booed right off stage if happen . please enough crucifixion stunts all ready .	-1

i really wanted like this cd . i tried , i really . but end , it never got above generic rock me . yes , it rock pretty hard times , but main thing i couldn't get past pretentiousness lyrics . enough heavy-handed biblical imagery already , barbara ! leave sort thing dylan ... he knows what it . ( fact , they end this cd cover bob " highway 61 revisited , " don't song any favors . ) while barbara keith power her voice , i don't hear much soul . take listen neko case hear difference belter singer who mix strong voice subtlety . musically , cd full pretty straightforward rock riffs , bit lines joan jett without growl later zz top . they're basically competent bar band needs lay off sophomoric " poetry , " honestly , i'm bit baffled overwhelming response this cd gotten here amazon reviews . i guess this might sound good compared lot what you hear mainstream radio mtv ( when they play videos ) these days -- , you'd not doing much exploring outside mainstream over past decade or so . each their own , any case , but lyrics these songs make me cringe . i need it played more freewheeling spirit , more heart , more soul , little more creativity . bit sense humor wouldn't kill them either , matter	-1
this album far one my favorites . some might dismiss it lyrically perhaps musically inferior garfunkel sound . this really quite tragic , i see songs album perfect reflection who what garfunkel stand . i am 24 years old not even alive when album released so i cannot compare it pop music time -- although i never really classified art garfunkel pop --- more art music . what i say his voice , way he chooses use it , songs he chooses utilize it , lyrics he expresses touched me . he artist this album sense he knows himself what he wants say listener . if you looking sensitive garfunkel displaying his usual sensitive tenor voice , then this album you . it might even classified concept album it takes you through journey love	1
i love his song writting skills . really one kind , this real keen i waiting . border song good funny	1
1999 capitol released first stereo/mono single disc version this album . 2000 they re-released it , what i read time they goofed not used hdcd master 1999 release . i didn't bother buying it again because i don't player hdcd capability . last week i found out there reason they re-released it 2000 : when stereo version released , radio stations started playing stereo versions songs singles this album . stereo version " wouldn't it nice " carl wilson singing bridge ( ... maybe if we think wish hope pray it might come true ... ) , while it mike love voice mono version we've heard since 1966 . when he found out this , mike love capitol alter stereo version song insert bridge mono version him singing . when you listen stereo version song this cd , you hear how stereo folds down mono briefly during bridge . capitol good job splicing it together ; i hadn't noticed it until someone pointed it out me . altered version this song also appeared compilations released since 2000 . surround sound hi-resolution stereo versions album dvd-a dvd accompanies this release use unaltered track carl wilson singing bridge . i believe 2 lp vinyl set also uses unaltered stereo version	1
what america thinking , making albums nelly chart toppers ? remember time when actual artists made records could go #1 ? remember beatles ? you know , band wrote their own lyrics music ? actually , rap / hip-hop only beats background , which technically isn't music . rapping itself , well , it quite simple really ; if you can't sing , you rap . lyrics rapped so silly too . what moving song " flap ya wings " , notice amazingly clever witty way nelly abbreviates " your " " ya " title . don't give me any " rap way life , dawg " nonsense . it way or life or temporary fad , fact remains same : majority hip-hop bunch uneducated , noisy , loud , obnoxious , cocky , self-centered high school drop-outs who write rhymes piece paper call it art . rap never required any talent , , if things don't change drastically pathetic genre " music " , it never	-1
this cd hi-tech sharp jazzy . it reflects genre cowboy bebop anime series , all but one part first song ( where we hear opening theme song ) all original material . dj ( who speaks songs ) odd , but kind funny -- talking old bands 2040s cracks jabba hutt . if you enjoy smooth tasteful lounge , well some danceable trance/ambient tunes this probably excellent buy you . you might want check your anime shop , before plunking down 30 bucks it , but it still cash well spent	-1

her 2nd release , cash turns extremely solid effort . i really liked her debut ' right or wrong ' , but ' seven year ache ' gave good glance what really come . nothing against outside writers who contributed their songs -but her initial songwriting efforts , she pulls off two extremely strong tracks they carry album ( title track " blue moon w/heartache " ) . all tracks their high points - only i one i usually skip over ' hometown blues " . " seven year ache " great track holds up 2+ decades up there w/the perfect songs this genre .... pretty good overall most . cash vocals strong rodney crowell production clean - almost too clean . good use crowell band former hot band memebers . rosemary butler emmylou harris outstanding harmony vocal work throughout entire disk . extra track this disk ok , but nothing anyone ever missing . live version " seven year ache " muddy either poorly recorded or performed . only live cuts ' interiors ' seems really good quality . sound quality remaster good - it her other two reissues . really worth checking out . btw ... could not find any reissues stores . all ordered through amazon .	-1

easily one my favorite dylan albums , if it not top five , it certainly top ten . lot people , who written off mr. d relevance , taken aback when this record came out . there lot , " dylan back . " or " i knew he it him . " kind comments going around after folks gave this record listen too . folks biz , those know , started calling " oh mercy " dylan comeback record . but then there those who faithful fans , listening appreciating his music all . them , dylan never really gone anywhere come back . said , this record harkens back those dylan albums yesteryear , those story songs so wonderful . this most certainly five star album one you absolutely must own . reviewed stephanie san	1
good talent evidence such no more tears tells you , zakk wylde wasted solo artist constantly ripping his own music , creating average album after average album without break ( one every year ) talking smack everyone but drozzy . his fake biker persona tough-guy exterior only veils his insecurities guitarist his creative bankruptcy . mafia , which i some hopes since 3-star blessed hell ride truly dissapoints . suicide messiah its catchy riffing chorus pulled me into getting this crap even zakk not listen years come . then you this river , so-called tribute mighty dimebag . zakk everyone noticed made great name during after dimebag sad untimely death repeatedly talking how close he great southern trendkiller . then you expect mandatory tribute song utterly cheesy , classless stupid this river . wish it dime who makes it other end river ! if zakk stops concentrating bitching other artists , throwing eggs legends singing like wannabe ozzy , perhaps he make some good music future .	-1
world where most artists assume they produce noisy , discordant , non-melodic fodder equally beguilled public these guys nice retreat . just plain good ole rock you play all way thru without torturing yourself trying listen it 10 times before " you get it " like some crud passed off art these days . ( yes , i hate emo death/thrash metal)this only album theirs i've listened looking forward grabbing rest their work	1
" louder than bombs " smiths compilation sorts , collection non-album singles , b-sides several tracks smiths ' first compilation " hatful hollow " . many these tracks you can't get anywhere else . well , you get them " world won't listen " , but that very similar compilation this one . it good value collection , fine introduction band , i think . there 24 tracks , recorded 1984-1987 , all different styles moods . all fantastic guitar playing johnny marr , while andy rourke bass mike joyce guitar keep things catchy too . morrissey lyrics though , what makes this record , smiths , really special , i think . he witty times , he warm , he sympathetic he despairing , often all same song . he comes up some great little phrases his songs . subject matters , he covers all sorts things , just johnny marr covers all sorts moods . " shoplifters world unite " lends ear commercially compulsive , " this night opened my eyes " sees mother abandon child , " girl afraid " touches pushy girl/passive guy relationship , " you just haven't earned it yet baby " ( which i reckon really should gone hit single ) sums up pain struggling striving , whether attempts find love or attempts famous . it one my favourites album band , " rubber ring " , where morrissey urges listener not " forget songs made you cry , ones saved your life " spare happy thought him after such songs helped you through tough times . if anyone else singing it , it might come across bit arrogant , but smiths wrote some powerful songs , morrissey knew it ! there also instrumental johnny marr ( " oscillate wildly " ) very strange , but typically morrissey , cover song ( twinkle " golden lights " ) . booklet fairly simple , but it comes lyrics all songs , which very nice band like smiths . overall , great introduction band , great addition smiths/morrissey collection , great bunch songs . recommended .	1

obie trice , member shady records , released his sophomore effort , called " second round me " . his first album , " cheers " , released back 2003 , very promising debut . i loved album , i'm starting like this one just much i like his first . obie definitely through lot this year . he almost killed when someone shot him driveby detroit , he also lost his cousin proof ( . i . . ) . so , i thought obie would definitely come it this album . i've waiting this long time , considering release date pushed back quite few times . well now it finally out it doesn't let me down all . after intro , which his mom yelling him because he selling drugs , very first song " wake up " . i love this cut . he rhymes how black people need wake up before society takes them down . good track start out . " violent " next . honestly , it nothing special , but i like obie chorus i like beat eminem . course , it how he violent . next track , " wanna know " , first track i heard this cd long time ago . this certain video game soundtrack but i can't remember which one . anyway , i love this cut . sample chorus great . obie rhymes point well . " snitch " akon track i mixed feelings . one thing , whole " don't snitch " thing wasn't good begin , now it played out . but , akon chorus very , very catchy . it hard deny song akon chorus ( atleast me it ) . song sounds pretty good , despite topic too cliche . so it actually okay track . " cry now " cut released single ( i think ) . i seen video it imf one day . song great . beat witt pep awesome , obie tells haters they cry now . " ballad obie trice " nice too . eminem made beat electronic voice saying " ob-ie trice " over over again chorus , which i think cool . " all my life " featuring nate dogg catchy song made ladies . it kind like laid-back party track . i like beat trell , nate dogg chorus catchy , always . " there they go " sort like detroit posse cut , eminem trick trick appearing . everyone drops good verses , especially eminem , production good . trey songz drops good chorus " mama " , 50 cent stops give decent chorus " everywhere i go " . " obie story " probably best song this album offer . it starts off obie telling how he little kid , then him slanging dope , then his daughter born how he changed his life around . production jonathon rotem excellent so obie lyrics . perfect way end album . album few duds well . " lay down " isn't necessarily bad cut , but obie flow doesn't match beat well . song sounds little off-kilter . " jamaican girl " falls flat , basically filler song . " kill me mutha " just song same boat " violent " " lay down " . " out state " , where obie raps how he going get his paper no matter what , just hustling track fails take off . " ghetto " nice chorus trey songz , but again , concept worn out . there way too many " this ghetto " type tracks they get old after awhile . " 24 " done-to-death song . who cares what his rims sitting ? i don't . despite these drawbacks , album solid one obie . i like he doesn't overload his album skits it doesn't play much over hour , i think it only clocks 62 minutes . there too many albums whole 79 minutes worth crappy music . i'm glad this doesn't . yes , album may really dark album , but if i through what he through this year , my album would dark well . i still wouldn't say this album beats cheers , i don't even think it good cheers , but it definitely good album . i think his next album , obie needs stay away worn-out subject matter topics his songs so there won't much filler his next album . tracks like " out state " , " kill me mutha " , especially " 24 " don't belong obie trice cd . but all good tracks this album offer override bad ones . so all all , obie made good record . nice lyrics decent production make great listen . if you're obie trice fan , you won't disappointed picking this up . i still recommend this any one who likes hip-hop well .	-1

bup , bu bu bup , bu bu bup , bu bup , bu bup bup - percussive use electric piano so mind-blowingly catchy this album , i listened kill moonlight obsessively two months . i disagree reviewer who said girls tell more immediate two albums . if nothing else , sheer a**-shaking nature most moonlight makes it so much fun new listeners take ( this my experience experiences those whom i introduced spoon ) . i also ( vehemently ) disagree other reviewers who stated kill moonlight empty , or somehow otherwise unfulfilling . degrade spoon fourth lp offering nothing more than experiments rock band into arena indie dance sounds ignore depth meticulousness which britt daniel company pen their songs . take , example , small stakes . first listening , i don't think anything stands out quite much overall pulsating feeling music . keyboard tambourine - this seemingly all needs exist lean world spoon creating . closer inspection reveals lyrics just gnawing incessant beat : " oh yeah , small stakes ensure you minimum blues/but you don't feel taken you don't feel abused/small stakes tell you there nothing do/can't think big , can't think past one or two alright ! /yeah , alright/me my friends sell ourselves/short but feel very well/we feel fine , aw we feel fine/ ... " . how could anyone call this album vapid ? juxtaposition uber-danceable music restless lyrics youth reveal such gutting , underlying dissatisfaction or meaninglessness . lot spoon music this album youthful revelry - escapism it all . take way we get : " we get high backseats cars/we break into mobile homes/we go sleep shake appeal/never wake up our own/and that way we get ! " or jonathon fisk , song bully daniel small-town past : " jonathon fisk speaks his fists/can't let me walk home my own/and just like knife down my life/so many ways set me right/ ... /jonathon then says it sin/but he don't think twice ' cause him/religion don't mean thing/it just way right wing/ ... " . lot spoon fans complain when spoon comes out new album because it always aesthetically different last release . i agree spoon each album doesn't ( shouldn't ) sound same . each time around they push themselves create well-crafted thoughtful albums without confining themselves one sound . ultimately , exactly why i am recommending this album - it sounds amazing it lot say	1
any mp3 you find can't this justice - you need original article . buy it glad you . this album chill f**k , but it won't put you sleep . same way reich or glass maintain static dynamic , this album always move if you look - otherwise , it content lounge background . i like it most because it what i think ' optional listening ' album : there great depth if you choose listen critically , yet album doesn't require thinking cap enjoy .

i bought this album because i am so into sigur ros moment it seems all reviews i read say " ... if you like sigur ros you like mbv .. " let me say this album no where near sigur ros experience . if i could compare them anyone it would very early cocteau twins , though i must clear i don't think singer anywhere close artistic sense vocal talent elizabeth fraser . it would more palatable if production value higher .... it sounds terrible . sound quality comparable some old vhs tapes i mid 80 i recorded off tv ( then soaked water few days ! ) .	-1

... when you're gearing up suicide . this whole album sounds like last thoughts comments person who going just end it all . i found myself suffering nightmares , fatigue , misery paranoia . my ears unclogged but i started getting headaches fuzzy feel my head . this not good album stressed , because it just make you feel worse . i find this album unlikable mostly unenjoyable . when i first listened it it sounded inaccessable , after listening it more more i started get more " into " it , but i can't say i found it good place . it somewhat interesting album , but it mostly just dragged me down , made me nervous , numb hurt my head . people say this great music . let them say what they want . give me some old fashioned enjoyable music doesn't make pest itself . kid just ok me , hasn't worth all effort " get into " . this almost seems like sadomasochistic album spank listeners . i don't know , maybe i'm missing something , but hear some " weird " music like this miles more heart alot kinder ears , try " passengers " u2 . thom york sings like muppet this album . way i've enjoyed radiohead first three albums quite bit ( including pablo honey -- why people always busting its chops ) .	-1

" 5 times out 100 " first reminded me little one their first albums " scenes one through thirteen " terms keyboard . this song really energetic my favorite part 3/4 way through it when song slows down bit . " more show " great course amazing lyrics like " dollhouse drawn sand . random lack dirty hands " . it complete feel good song .	1

i pre-ordered this set , knowing i going buy it regardless reviews not yet posted . i got it locked $23.99 , which subsequently changed $29.88 day this review . so there may lesson value pre-order , especially if you just know you indeed make purchase . big george harrison fan , now knowing all we look forward things already exist , i happy see expansion his catalog modern age sound engineering well visual arena this se t.t he dvd made me go this route rather than cd only , nine or ten dollars less than 15 minute disc , i am not sure monetary value . i guess years come , i happy i spent up expanded set . this dvd one thing my expectations future . both previously issued " dark horse " dvd this one nicely rendered 5.1 videos 1991 japan concerts , which must mean there videos all songs double cd . i hope we see those songs concert dvd future . dvd bit shock me , because years listening cds tour japan , i assumed terrific slide work " give me love " george himself . it surprising watch both harrison clapton strumming acoustics , while andy fairweather-low replicated slide sound harrison style . still , it nice see george playing front crowd . rest songs dvd basically audio soundtracks montage stills non-related video support songs . alternate take " sue me , sue you blues " really stripped down raw . it would nice cd too . actual album nicely rendered it ever . george voice strong clear , while band musical playing comes through exactly where it needs . elements sounds very nicely balanced . quality songs historical data point george post-beatles career . he really strong album measured against this sophomore studio recording . my opinion he such deep catalog waiting put " all things must pass " , he may set bar too high any future endeavors . this very good album , but me " all things must pass " better one , especially first listen . i played this new rendering " living material world " 5 times now , i am just beginning get point able " know " songs . still , this must anyone wishing fill out their harrison collection more modern media ( my first litmw 8 track ! ) . fwiw , my enjoyment this album indeed all my george harrison albums , including wilbury , greatly enhanced my purchase book , " while my guitar gently weeps , music george harrison " ( available amazon ) . it chronologically breaks down every era george music offers nice details recording sessions all his work . this album example , there 15 pages devoted band he used , who played which songs even review how record received fans critics . true fans george music , this book make all your albums more fun listen , open your eyes parts his thinking you may not known .	-1

i've always thought " get back " sessions one most fascinating periods beatles ' history . back-to-basics concept ; infighting ; iconic rooftop concert ; multiple attempts create finished album dozens songs hours aimless tapes ; treasure trove bootleg material surfaced years later . album finally emerge sessions , " let it , " intriguing document any other produced band . beatles such reputation perfectionism it refreshing hear them let loose bash out few jams . despite palpable strain sessions ( captured " let it " film ) , their musical partnership still strong capable producing amazing collaborative efforts . first two efforts constructing " get back " album ( which available bootlegs but should really released officially ) more faithful initial goal sessions : capture band live sound reduce their dependence overdubs retakes . phil spector finished product retains dialogue , jokes , technical blemishes . it also edits , lengthens , adds orchestral overdubs several songs ( but point , beatles largely abandoned back-to-basics idea anyway ) . result unique hybrid studio sheen rough edges , meticulous craft fluid spontaneity . it also contains some beatles ' very best songs . george dryly humorous " you blue " personal favorite . universally acknowledged classics like " two us , " " get back , " " let it , " " across universe " speak themselves -- how any album containing these songs could branded disappointment , i may never understand . when discussing " let it , " it common hear cliche bad beatles album still better than most bands ' best material . forget . " let it " great album its own right	1
i disagree last reviewer -- i this album it excellent -- it not reissue life . upon more than superficial examination album description , it reads , " reissue hit swedish pop quintet 1994 debut four tracks european edition their 1995 album ' life ' added bonus tracks , ' pikebubbles ' , ' travelling charley ' , ' sunday circus song ' ' closing time ' . " it their first album bonus tracks european version life . carnival isn't one them . it probably not good idea judge this album based facts aren't true . cardigans always release great , interesting intelligent records i would recommend emmerdale any other cardigans cd future listeners .	1

what whole world let alone cali doing 92/93 , not what they where doing 99 , just maybe 7 years apart but rap not heading into 2000 without bang , if it wasnt 4 dre-2001 . greatest album far , im speaking albums concept , beat production , this ahead its time . people may say there party songs what not , but since this album droped , it still hasnt got old , snoop came , heard beats , reestablished his dre career , eminem just stamped his trademark lyrics , 2 tha good(then died out)but not this album . all all if dre showed people how 2 it 1992 through 99 , he showed them how 2 keep it going . next episode , xplosive , every track it going , only problem some songs needed 2 little bit longer . so you could say lyrics where not better , not good , but it everybody pouring there heart out some creative rhymes , six 2 , snoop , kurupt , dre even brought back d.o.c. , devin dude , i mean come , this 4 ever greatest album , until maybe detox . please believe me	1

drive long praised one most innovative extraordinary groups music . however there time their career when they just finding their footing growing into monster they would become . trial stage " acrobatic tenement " , but this , their sophomore album " in/casino/out " , drive displayed what they known , years now : amazing song-writing . if you're not familiar early stages band went through get where they , then this utmost importance listen . not just , but it even more evidence why drive easily one best bands last 10 years , one most inspirational original groups emerge music . " alpha centauri " opens album dizzying fashion , giving way shattering guitar chords , frantic drumming , soulful performance front man cedric . jim omar play off one interesting ( most impressive ) guitar structures progressions , most times leave your jaw floor . however they only complimented paul rumbling bass lines tony outlandish drumming . this just first song . don't get comfortable , because quickly " alpha centauri " ends , jarring , schizophrenic " chanbara " kicks showcasing its wild yells , interesting drumming excellent lyrics . you hear bit mars-volta-ish style vocals during verse , which sign things would come future after drive in break-up . but just quickly band floor you powerful tracks , driving numbers like " napoleon solo " " hourglass " show how diverse they get drop hat . however i wouldn't say this difficult listen all . " hulahoop wounds " , " now .. we toast " " transatlantic foe " all upbeat accessible , but they easily balanced out more aggressive pieces like " shaking hand incision " " devil among tailors . " there such wide range dynamics writing here , it hard get bored anything band presents . all 11 tracks found album though , " lopsided " got absolute best . i go far say it best song band ever written . now course i hold certain bias since it both first song i ever heard band my personal favorite . like all songs found disc , lyrics absolutely stunning ( cedric really one greatest writers music ) musicianship unparalleled . furthermore it probably most strikingly different tune band ever recorded . while every song record instant classic itself , " lopsided " truly set standard what i held drive too . after all said , there not single moment this cd anything less than enjoyable . while this album not considered great their final album " relationship command " , ( i no idea why though ) " in/casino/out " really necessary purchase all fans band , indie-rock/post-hardcore general . it really biggest stepping stone band discography , if it lead great products like " vaya " " relationship command , " it would seem like there little complain . while " acrobatic tenement " bit pre-mature , " in/casino/out " truly when this band become one innovators modern music . easily deserves endless mass praise .	1
there legions one hit wonders who their one big hit disappeared music scene . when don mclean burst upon charts quot ; american piequot ; there good chance he might quickly disappear well since it fairly obvious odds against him ever bigger hit . but while mclean never hit popular he certainly proved he more than one great song him when he wrote quot ; vincentquot ; ( a.k.a. quot ; starry starry nightquot ;) couple very good songs quot ; i love you soquot ; quot ; castles air . quot ; i even like his quot ;d riedelquot ; song anybody who cover roy orbison quot ; cryingquot ; shows good taste well . yes , it clear there there songs this album not worth listening more than once , but ones good simply great . mclean clearly one those artists where you just need his quot ; best ofquot ; album . final note : i always thought name character vincent television quot ; beauty beastquot ; taken mclean song given line : quot ; but i could told you , vincent , this world never meant one beautiful you . quot	1

steve khan green field appropriately named : it fertile , sweeping plain musical feeling insight fills listener both peace awe . there something special trio khan , dejohnette pattitucci one finds almost nowhere else : ability each player make their own unique mark music while same time contributing cooperative sum greater than three put together . khan long favorite mine couple simple reasons : his melodies catchy , his solos articulate moving , his sense rhythm ( accompaniment ) provide bill evans-like brush strokes perfectly appropriate . dejohnette , most know , master musician whose drumming like fire ice -- controlled understated until you come understand power lurks just beneath graceful surface . patitucci blends marvelously -- he drives momentum provides melodic interest all same time . my view , steve khan one most underrated guitar players jazz today . he shouldn't . this disk show you , his smart melodies beautifully architectural improvisations rank very best . i highly recommend this disc . it make you fan	1
george strait " greatest hits " released 1985 contains his first 10 hits . it incredible collection shows why george so successful . very beginning , he worked some best songwriters producers business , which really shows this work . george ton hits now #5 country artists all-time . it all started these songs . 1 ) unwound - george first hit kick-started his enduring career peaking #6 1981 . terrific up-tempo song lots fiddles , it first many hits he recorded written or co-written dean dillon . this amusing song drinking away your problems contains this amusing lyric - cause woman i had/ wrapped around my finger just come unwound . terrific stuff . 2 ) down out - great swing song . this song only went #16 1981 , but it would more than decade before one his hits stopped short top 10.3 ) if you're thinking you want stranger ( there one coming home ) - george first top 3 hit ( #3 1982 ) one his best songs ever . story couple growing apart , song manages pack amazing variety under 3 minutes . 4 ) fool hearted memory - george first #1 hit ( #1 one week 1982 ) beautiful up-tempo ballad man remembering old love . 5 ) marina del rey - george first hit slow ballad ( #6 1983 ) . it some really lovely lyrics , such : we looked into each others eyes/ we found our bodies lost paradise/ like castaways/ marina del ray . 6 ) amarillo morning - simply my favorite song george ( #4 1983 ) . true classic bull rider , cmt deservedly named it one top 10 country songs all time . lyrics so evocative , starting incredible beginning ( amarillo morning/ up san antone ) best lyrics any strait song - well i'll looking eight/ when they pull gate/ i'm hoping that/ judge ain't blind . fade-out violins haunting apropos ending . 7 ) fire i can't put out - george second #1 hit ( #1 one week 1983 ) story past love . 8 ) you look so good love - includes somewhat sappy spoken-word interlude ( #1 one week 1984 ) . it not one my favorites cd but quite smooth . 9 ) right or wrong - george got back recording some hit swing this song ( #1 one week 1984 ) . it sounds contemporary but could recorded hank williams ; extraordinary song . 10 ) let fall pieces together - sweet ballad finding solace arms when you're pain ( #1 one week 1984 ) . this cd must-have fans george strait country music ; every song here quite good . although his later box set includes all these songs , i like this collection well , it absolutely no filler . most highly recommended .	1
i discovered him accident while watching ozzfest 10th anniversary tv documentary . there set this band finland it took me all 15 seconds recognize talent lead singer ville vallo . band him . make no mistake , his haunting lyrics voice unique truly special driving force behind this band . his persona perfectly represents battle every person light dark storyline bands music . he show . i listened every recording this band everything they put out really good . " dark light " natural evolution . not everybody likes evolution but me what makes music great thus this ranks hims best work . making music like construction project this record far more complicated ambitious than anything previous . comparing it bands initial release like comparing single story building skyscraper ! guitar , drums , keyboarding etc all much more complex crisp than previous recordings . imo band finally caught up bar lead singer set beginning . if you never listened this band i highly recommend you buying this cd .	1

when mccartney beatles , he more or less held check songwriter john lennon , who really guiding force behind beatles sound . without balance , mccartney went off his own basically , became less less discerning . or , maybe he just felt his fans weren't sophisticated . i suppose we'll never know . anyway , mccartney first solo albums beatle-type stuff , really , not bad . then came , " band run " which marked turning point , typifies rest mccartney work . i can't imagine how anyone listen this sort garbage without recalling great sound beatles songs like , " i call your name " , " you can't " , " drive my car " , or " i feel fine " . when artist musician robert crumb once asked why he killed off one his comic book characters , " fritz cat " , crumb replied character become " too cute " " needed killing . " after hearing " silly love songs " , " jet " , " band run " , " listen what man said " , " let ' em " piped through public address systems every grocery store retail chain i've last decade , i pretty much feel same way paul mccartney music : it too cute , it needs go away .	-1
released prior inchoate stage " grunge " movement , neil young crazy horse " ragged glory " stands alone work exemplary garage-rock . devout admirer young entire catalog , i must say " ragged glory " remains my unequivocal favorite . album represents epitome songcraft sheer power ; neil lyrics make seemingly mundane ( yet archetypal ) human experiences seem positively transcendent . absolutely epic soundscapes " country home " nearly utopian idealizations " love only love , " crazy horse created extraordinarily affective portrait life , love , loss , apprehension . " over over " contains one most memorable hooks i've ever heard my life . " f* ! #in ' up " gloriously relentless , self-effacing study self-doubt this day remains staple during pearl jam concerts . structurally , " ragged glory " relatively consistent : several songs key , accompanied warm , lush , tubes-are-abou t-t o-blow guitars . while there fair share neil erratic soloing , album use single-note themes over layers fuzzy les pauls render songs incredibly memorable . ultimately , " ragged glory " makes one hell first impression only manages get better after repeated listens . neil young always possessed proclivity surrealism his work ; extent , " ragged glory " no exception . lyrically album relatively straightforward ; when coupled masterful arrangements towering walls sound , lyrics evoke thoughts people , places , experiences we believed long forgotten . words fail express brilliance exemplified neil crazy horse this album : it work musical genius easily belongs pantheon rock classics .	1

radiohead started new millenium this , fractured twitchy record , frighteningly alien ( post apocalyptic chill ) but same time warm tender . album art says it all , showing bleached barren landscape overrun strange " evil teddy bears " . it radiohead definitive artistic statement , self consciously arty esoteric , but same time it where their sound headed all . opening pulsing keyboards " everything its right place " ending ( after several minutes silence ) soundscape bell like sounds , which builds what sounds like hundreds whispering voices ( then more silence ) . kid arresting listen , it demands you hear whole thing start finish . it very easy want so . some would find it too shocking , indeed , it described nightmarish . but underneath everything songs still pure their intent , if one concentrates them , they create their own story it . lyrics full confusion , loneliness , anger , defiance , something radiohead known . guitars may gone but radiohead still there . sonically , album relies largely repetition , particularly bassline terrific " national anthem " beats scattered throughout album something marvel , sparse metallic , but oh so listenable . album also takes styles not covered before radiohead such electronic music " ideoteque " , abstract very thin ( also most vocal centred song album ) ode what seems human sin ignorance . kid hard record love , but rewarding experience one find way . it transcendant piece music should not taken lightly .	-1

justly acclaimed set , now offered price cheaper than even naxos ever manages . incidentally each copy i've seen full booklet description tracks various cds [ .. ] this strauss integrale , aided recording quality never less than very acceptable usually excellent , ranks surely best thing even rudolf kempe ever . every piece works , but rather brusque metamorphosen , try i might , i can't admire - it lacks poetry christoph von dohnanyi wonderful version which i've praised elsewhere amazon - somewhat lumbering couperin dance suite devoid sparkle neatness characterizing erich leinsdorf asv rendition ( best luck trying track down ) . otherwise , though obviously it would shame miss out herbert von karajan , fritz reiner , sir georg solti , etc . ( or even underrated zdenek kosler aus italien ) , you could derive very good idea strauss orchestral accomplishments even if you never bought non-kempe recording again . two particular highlights : first , best ( because noblest ) don quixote ever committed disc ; second , milk-white tone manfred clement ever-fresh oboe concerto . where else you get even adequate - let alone impressive - performances such curiosities macbeth , violin concerto ( slightly marred soloist moments wayward intonation ) , or improbably-named parergon zur sinfonia domestica ? wonderful dresden band - associated strauss early 20th century onwards - such pieces , rather than usual provincial ensemble boxy-sounding broadcast dub some fugitive central european label , treat . this collection indicates gravity orchestral music loss when kempe died 1976 , all too early ( conductor ) age 65 .	1

record buyers certain age title this 1974 collection become default label any artist collection odds ends . small part , it catchy rhyme , but primarily it because this album defines essence non-album album release : alternative chronicle great band career point , overflowing non-lp , b-side previously unreleased tracks high artistic quality ( " little billy " " too much anything " " glow girl " " naked eye " " pure easy " ) , deep historical significance ( high numbers ' " i'm face , " unexplainably faded end this cd remaster ) , or concert favorites hadn't made it disc ( " long live rock " ) . original 1974 vinyl release would made five star straight-up reissue , but addition dozen more rarities , this album asserts its place longer-form cd world greatest rock ' ' roll odds-and-ends collection ever created . rare acetates " leaving home " " baby don't you it " document group early fascination motown , unreleased 1967 take eddie cochran " my way " shows off both muscle swagger . sympathy-for-the-stones cover " under my thumb " great historical artifact ( though it begs question why single flip , " last time , " isn't included ) , previously unreleased alternates " mary anne shaky hands " " love ain't keeping " show how band approach radically impact songs ' final groove . additional concert favorites include studio recording " young man blues " doesn't match grit previously released " live leeds " version ( nor , apparently , studio master take released 1969 label sampler " house track built , " inexplicably not included here ) , after-the-fact studio take " water .

i am huge garth fan , i all albums six his live concerts . i like pieces because song " red strokes " i don't really like music video it because i think garth could better what use video instead just red paint white room , because just thoes two things just scary when put together . but , i like song because it talks mainly love what color heart , he potrays it alot two people painting picture heart color they use alot red . he even talks how when your blue , color your heart blue when your jeleous your heart green . but when you love , your heart really red . general , pieces one garths better albums .	1

" jokerman " me reminiscent " subterranean homesick blues " i just picture younger dylan those signs tossing them away during singing " jokerman " way he " don't look back . " i'm not very spiritual person , but biblical references " jokerman " me going my bible ( everybody one , religious or not , right ? ) checking them out . then there " sweetheart like you , " song covered so well rod stewart , but even more sentimental when you hear it sung writer himself . this just super rock roll record , every song gem	1

this it , look no further : fun house stooges ' manic , excessive , drug , alcohol sex-fuelled homage everything anything yer bona fide very naughty boy could ever fun fun fun . nihilistic madness , lot it , but not yer sophisticated new yorker dressed black sort nihilism . more yer trailer trash rebel who doesn't want miss minute it . picture this album unfolding story weekend rampage , beginning opportunistism " down street " ending up come-down " l.a. blues " . musical mayhem describes pretty candidly what he gets up . probably cracking party , but one few us could survive intact . some pleasures better experienced vicariously , methinks	1
minus hails iceland , land rocky tundra quirky rock groups ( sugarcubes , bjork , sigur ros , mum , etc . ) none which hold candle meeting intensity minus . this bar none most unusual hardcore metal album i ever heard i'm loving it ! yes it screamy ( well most it ) , but it very melodic tons tempo changes keep you your feet . mainstream metal this ain't it isn't faint heart . if you're into slipknot need bit more attitude (!!) or more complexity layers , this might up your alley ! give it try !

echoes nature : ocean waves quickly became my favorite nature sound cd . it contains 4 tracks , each distinctly unique ocean sound . note : if you one those who not like animal sounds , couple tracks contain seagulls seals . i personally find them enjoyable , but then i am not using cd fall asleep . my personal favorite track big surf i love huge crashing waves . captivating relaxing . i later decided purchase other ocean recordings just more variety but not found any good . ( i've tried solitudes , sounds earth , but both dissapointing me comparison ) .	1

12 stones first cd actually pretty good . considering its pretty commercial . there really isn't anything groundbreaking here this release . fact , no means , makes music bad . it actually quite good . pretty much every song this cd good . i don't really remember how i discovered this album but i remember song made me want hear more . " fade away " . i loved song instantly . still love it . most songs this cd you're going love . despite all this good , if there one thing i say wrong it , it would it overplayed . it catchy songs very good but you get sick them pretty easily after frequent listening . so try not listen over over again . anyway , here my song ratings ... 1 . crash - 10/10 2 . broken - 10/10 3 . way i feel - 10/104 . open your eyes - 9.5 /10 5 . home - 8/106 . fade away - 10/107 . back up - 9/10 8 . soulfire - 9/109 . my head - 9/1010 . running out pain - 7/10 11 . my life - 8/10 12 . eric song - 8/10overall : 89% b+ 12 stone album nice piece modern rock truly great addition anyones collection . anyone who likes modern rock creed-like style should check this out . they also should check out cool band known doubledrive similar style .	-1
before getting steamed title my review , take time read my review objective sense . my critical anaylsis this album strictly objective possible . i took my time listening every single " song " this album , so this isn't uninformed review . now review . ------------------------------------------------------------ hell earth , mobb deeps third release , came out during era media-fabricated infamous east-coast-west-coast beef . throughout album , you get sense artist where suffucated negative climate time . songs lyrics this album , every way , reflect era . starting off album deep bass mixed dark-drum line instrumental . havoc prodigy lace beat self glorifying , tough guy lyrics accentuate grimy instrumental . though this album 14 tracks , you've hardpressed differentiate one other if it wasn't switch beat . level variation subject matter this album so limited review one tracks lyrics tell you all you need know album , lyric wise . there little no song concepts this album . nearly every single track hell earth polluted numerous references someone getting shot , how much better prodigy havoc than you , how they queensbridge , etc . through lyrical context this album , you almost get sense mobb deep too consumed negative climate rap time . you get sense they're lashing out anyone everyone may pose potential threat them . cuts like " drop gem them " " bloodsport " find them verbally attacking late tupac shakur . lyrics this album get so rediculous times you wonder what these guys thinking . you truely sit back question how these guys could put out track after track same tired material . only saving grace this album instrumentals . dark , grimey , horror movie like , they paint background horror terror . though good , instrumentals this album also start sound repetitive you get deeper into album . after while , they all start sound like cluster same stuff . i'm sorry , but no way shape or form this great album some stated . lack variation topics , ignorant , mindless gun thug brovado give this album no depth . if you're someone looking intelligent lyrics or creative concepts , yourself favor avoid hell earth all cost	-1
this album holds most weight my cd collection . specifically there four songs me never grow old or get boring they : - episodes which beautifal urban raw mystical feeling it stirs something inside no other hip hop song ever . universe war featuring common which amazingly powerful track . no great pretender - i would say most accomplished song episodes black thought finally chilled hypnotic , which just pure brilliance . it still some experimentalness it but nothing compared organix . its better produced than previous album " you want more " which classic also . cut long story short , this album powerful chilled jazzy hip hop its finest one smartest rap groups ever existed . it lead me admit roots my favourite hip hop group , you can't go wrong buying this album	1
best thing this album it one those undisputed classics you get just any place few bucks . jangle-pop doesn't get any better than this , neither indie rock , matter . tf great band , this their best album ... i am looking forward snagging their new best comp , _four thousand seven hundred sixty seconds_ . teenage fanclub band never graced goodlooking covers their albums . _bandwagonesque_ no different . just goes show : don't judge yadda yadda yadda ...	-1

go-go formed 1978 emerged their ska punk roots become goddesses pop punk when " we got beat " became underground hit 1980 . pop scene greeted go-go certain amount surprise , it seemed , because all-female band could play instruments wrote most their own songs . contrast their punk sensibility their perky , poppy demeanor made curious , memorable image suited glossy cynicism 1980s . " go-go's: greatest " best-of album covering band char t-t opping hey day 1980s . 14 tracks represent 3 albums go-go recorded before their breakup 1985 . ladies ' line-up " greatest " : charlotte caffey , lead guitar keyboards ; belinda carlisle , lead vocals ; gina schock , drums percussion ; kathy valentine , bass guitar , rhythm guitar , backup vocals ; jane wiedlin , rhythm guitar backup vocals . 1981 " beauty beat " , we #2 hit " we got beat " , #20 hit " our lips sealed " , " how much more " , " lust love " , " this town " . 1982 " vacation " , there #8 hit title track " vacation " , " get up go " , " cool jerk " , " beatnik beach " . 1984 " talk show " represented #11 hit " head over heels " , #32 hit " turn you " , " you thought " , " i'm only one " , " mercenary " . " head over heels " undeniably sophisticated pop punk , defiance those tempted write off go-go bubblegum band . " talk show " album generally lyrical musical sophistication beyond go-go 2 previous albums . it pretty darn good music . among non-hits this collection : " lust love " solid rockin ' love song manages create sense anticipation . " how much more " sounds like tribute 1950s sock hop pop " beatnik beach " 1960s surfing tunes . " you thought " expresses bitter end relationship more techno sound than other tracks . " greatest " isn't go-go whole story , band reunited record " return valley go-go " 1994 " god bless go-go " 2001 . but when it released 1990 , " greatest " pretty comprehensive hits package , it still nice summary band first wave , so speak . order songs cd flows all right , but it not chronological . unfortunately , no lyrics included .	1
" animal i become " playing over over local hard rock station . every time i heard it , i knew i it so i wrote down many lyrics i could looked them up internet found three days grace . i am glad i ! awesome album beginning end ! one best most solid cds i've gotten last ten years ! it living my cd player months now i still can't get enough . i definitely recommend it ! cd booklet opens up reveal dark artwork social angst , nice ( but small ) full color photo band , lyrics . here tracks : " it all over " : excellent , exploding opener beefy sound . apparently watching friend destroy him/herself ( " it gets under my skin see you giving " ) . it not best track here , but appropriate , energetic song open album . " pain " : slow verses explosive chorus . little repetitive somewhat contrived lyrics " pain ! i like it rough `cause i'd rather feel pain than nothing all " ) . i like verses bridge . " animal i become " : love it ! reason i bought this cd . clear deliberate vocals heavy guitar . flat out kicks ! still my favorite . " never too late " : beautiful acoustic guitar blending vocals . wonderful power ballad verses explodes chorus . inspirational lyrics serious but not sappy : " even if i say / it all right / still i hear you say / you want end your life / now again we try / just stay alive / maybe we'll turn it around / cause it not too late / it never too late . "" my own " : track starts slow then rocks ! part before chorus brings up intensity my favorite . great vocals there . chorus bit stilted . i also like bridge this track . " riot " : this style music may not best create effective riot song , but they try . it probably heaviest track album . still chorus " let start riot ! " doesn't sound too convincing , but we probably wouldn't want it . lyrics verses better : " if you feel so empty / so used up , so let down / if you feel so angry / so ripped off , so stepped / you're not only one / refusing back down / you're not only one / so get up " driving guitar riff brief solo almost sounds like old school metal . some almost ill nino-esque screaming incorporated this track , too . " get out alive " : dark opening . nice , slow track excellent bridge . lyrics chorus bug me little because it sounds like he singing " if you want get life , run your life , " ( uh , yeah ); but he actually singing " if you want get out alive , run your life " but it doesn't sound like it . " let it die " : very accessible , mainstream-sounding track . nice , laid-back sound verses . i like blunt lyrics fire extinguishing relationship : " i swear i never meant let it die / i just don't care you anymore . "" over over " : very memorable song . it slower accessible like " let it die . " it also some orchestration background . " time dying " : i like this track lot . it very catchy , sing-along chorus . " gone forever " : this song ok , it not one my favorites here . lyrics more memorable than music . chorus not good ones other tracks this album . " one " : this final track sums up underlying theme this cd : disappointment where life gotten one . but this song gives positive message things might get better : " we ones / we get knocked down / we get back up / stand above crowd / we one . " end it : " we stand above crowd " background , little sappy , though .	1
rem one greatest alternative rock bands around . get this album ! highlights-1)try not breathe-an amazing song , it despair . quite harrowing . 2)everybody hurts-one could see this counterpoint former . this song says you're not alone if you're suffering , because " everybody hurts . " 3)sweetness follows-a melancholy song lossrecovery it . 4)monty got raw deal-michael stipe ode montgomery clift . it amazing opening section , celtic flavor . you'd think it michael flatley , not michael stipe . 5)nightswimming-chris martin coldplay thinks this greatest rock song ever written . fact , he right this one . ( though his song " i fix you " just comes across --- wrong)this melancholy reflection past ; it could interpreted song forbidden love , furtive meetings , fearanticipation . pianostring quartet make this intimate , almost classical , piece . 6)find river-an astounding song life journey . it wraps up melancholy tone this album hopefulness future . yes , this isn't feel-good pop ; this isn't haylie duff or justin timberlake , but it true modern classic !	-1
this great collection ep tracks . i'm not sure why most reviewers found these songs hard find - only non us release " this just modern rock song " ep , which still easily available $10 time release . ( 3 ) ep , this marks 3rd time they released , but least silly 3 ep box set seems replaced . music ??? music great , classic tracks here , including one best songs they ever , " beautiful " . later ep build sound " fold your hands .. " which good thing ! there few skippable tracks here ( why any other male besides stuart murdoch sing this band - least female vocals great ) but they few far betwee	-1

i don't know what deal . most people seem disappointed mos not rap very much album . while mos def one best mcs game , definetly my favorite mc all time , i literally blown away his singing this album . songs like panties feature very little lyrically ( there 7 or 8 lines lyrics this song total ) , music extremely solid , it seems like mos giving you little room enjoy track . when he decide spit , they're most solid rhymes come out any album last year . i lot say this album but i don't want waste lot space . this album turned me mos fan into mos fanatic , i only hope it same you	1
before buying this album i heard only few songs vbs ' website . they all dirty echo i love so much , same one you hear white stripes , strokes , et cetera . i buy album make it through first seven or so songs ... then girls start singing . but they can't really sing too well . it , erm ... well , first part album good , so maybe this -- well , no , it not going away . fact , girls keep singing . oh no , my eye twitching i can't get it stop . i guess what i'm trying say here half album good other half crap . i cannot stand girls ' voices . they're painfully monotone leave this horrible dry pink taste your mouth . but jason voice so full passion some cases you hold your heart together . it get bit old though ... so if you buy this one , buy it used . pay only good half album	-1

hype surrounding this release so much when it came out i couldnt help but little skeptical , but hype totally justified . he labelled everything " hiphop saviour " " new rakim " . his rhyme-style unmatched time . intelligent , witty , sharp , intricate flows combined smooth yet captivating delivery . only thing kind takes anything away this masterpiece elevator music tracks " climb " " umi says " . remainder simply put , perfect hiphop . joints like " hiphop " , " know " , " it now " " mathematics " make your neck nod so much you damn near get whiplash . joints like " ms. fat booty " make you laugh+get down same time , while joints like " new world water " , " speed law " " got " display his wonderful wordplay . all others just tight great examples although good , solid hiphop rare commodity it still exist !! if you dont this get your ass gear+go cop it quick	-1

i want give it 4 1/2 stars . not most moving album ever made but it depends what you want accomplish your listening experience . this very solid album . there some weak songs but there more good than not so good . no bad songs here . i think girls tell much better which seem discouraging because it implies they lost something or regressing . i dont think thats case , i think they just grew direction i dont prefer their last album . maybe band doesnt like it much either , who knows . but this album worth owning so if you get free shipping buy it .	-1

i fan rent years . i've seen play live five times , sing all songs without cd repeat all dialogue verbatim . said , i highly disappointed movie interpretation this play incredible music . part rent beauty its musical simplicity . anyone who seen play , you know all music comes small four man band onstage . movie over-orchestrated heck out everything , making it lose clarity stage version holds . it made into studio prodect . voices overwhelmed orchestra , simply travesty . while tracie thoms rosario dawson both decent singers , their voices not power their roles require . " out tonight " , one my favorite numbers play , mangled dawson , whose vocal register simply cannot handle demands role mimi places upon it . thoms cannot carry joanne , some parts fredi walker rocked out obcr squeaked out thoms . ( particular , " tango maureen " : take me or leave me " . ) role joanne requires certain vocal presence richness voice , thoms cannot deliver . original cast members , adam pascal performance particular extremely disappointing . rock sensibility wowed me obcr gone , replaced whiny psuedo-emo rocker style movie . movie also left out much great music stage version , including various christmas bells , happy new year , contact , it considerably weaker it . if you're considering buying this soundtrack , yourself favor get original cast recording instead . it money much better spent	-1
judging what written this group you might expect something close rapture when you pop this cd . it good stuff , sure , some it great . but fans old sun records stuff won't find anything revelatory here . guitar work pretty cool distinctive , burnette scream best them . problem , scream almost seems set timer . it becomes formulaic after awhile just doesn't same spontaneity gene vincent or early elvis . nitpicking aside , fans early rock ' ' roll roots music shouldn't disappointed this album . it like slab prime rib : great stuff , but still bit letdown when you've ordered filet mignon	-1
back 1996 , i heavily into primarily dance music ( house amp ; trance ) smidgeon punk ( not good charlotte sort garbage ) alternative music . roommate mine time worked local radio station brought home free cds everyone . one free goodies i got single quot ; curlylocksquot ; baby fox . i loved what i heard . it nothing i ever heard time its slick icy melodies , slow electronic beats , sensual female vocals . time , i not know this trip hop music . i eventually got group full length cd ( quot ; normal familyquot ;) quot ; curlylocksquot ; it . i recently excavated quot ; normal familyquot ; one my many piles cds slipped cd into my stereo . baby fox reminds me portishead , motorcycle , hooverphonic , olive , telepopmusik their slick , laid back beats ethereal female vocals . i almost forgot why i loved this cd so much several years ago . it truly ahead its time before chill out music became rage electronica scene today . all songs quot ; normal familyquot ; top-notched . i could not find one song i didn't like . i especially love quot ; ladybirdquot ; , quot ; curlylocksquot ; , quot ; your dreamsquot ; , quot ; alienwayquot ; . it shame this band short-lived . considering just how big chill out music today , baby fox definitely could sustained career music today . quot ; normal familyquot ; one those forgotten gems got sidetracked current music scene time . i'm glad i re-discovered baby fox	1

while i'm not sure i would really want it , i asked continuum press write one their 33 1/3 mini books favorite album , i just might choose wire third album 154 . partially , this choice would something compromise i doubt book nurse wound homotopie marie would make saleable product . 154 stands my mind epitome what post-punk should : bold fusion post-situationist / punk antagonism legitimately experimental methodologies undercurrent smarty-pop keep kids bouncing up down . i actually came wire somewhat late my record nerd existance , i actually grew admire band through reverse history sorts , i didn't really start enjoying first three wire albums ( pink flag , chairs missing , 154 ) until other graham lewis bruce gilbert projects entranced me thier experiments proto-electronica . this especially true ghostly post-structuralism found their dome records . those lewis / gilbert projects took their genetic code shadow gloom elements 154 . album made under personal duress , 154 drips disintegration . fact band split apart almost 7 years after making 154 , pursuing variety projects -- traces which quite present this album colin newman pop sarcasm continued through his solo records vast array lewis / gilbert projects . recorded 1979 , 154 marks band third radical reinvention three years . wire pacing slowed lugubrious , factory-esque crawl but lost none their punk antagonism . slower pacing better suited baritone vocals graham lewis , who penned many lyrics colin newman sang . lesser hands , patchwork forboding atmospheric dirges punchy power pop numbers would appear disjointed ; but wire deft use synthetic coloring , exquisite timing , simply great songwriting smear whole album into wholly convincing masterpiece . " i should known better " " touching display " represent few graham lewis ' baritone marches through plodding drone heavy basslines , which more common late ' 80s , proto-doom swans than snarl buzzcocks . newman pop brilliance also shines 154 through " 15th , " which sadly more people recognize tepid fischerspooner cover than this punk-pop gem . first three wire albums , 154 proudly stands most challenging most rewarding	1

first , word all those morally opposed punk rock music : i feel your pain . i used one you . but then i bought call doctor ( whim ) . changed everything . i now understand why so many people-even those who don't enjoy most punk music-love sleater-kinney . reason ? there simple one-word answer : power . call doctor doesn't just exude power , it explodes it out your stereo speakers . it album pure , unfiltered emotion . s-k gets off rip-roaring start title track , feral creation spews lyrics like " i'm your monster / i'm just like you " over raging guitars . sparse " hubcap " reams someone ( lover ? friend ? ) who plays god . best all , though , " little mouth , " " i'm not waiting , " " i wanna your joey ramone . " corinne tucker pushes her wailing voice its limit " little mouth , " screaming " i'm your little mouth " repeatedly until it lodges your brain forever . " i'm not waiting " serious-minded anti-cinderella jaunt still feels fresh 11 years later . expected , " joey ramone " homage but also s-k declaration independence : " i'm queen rock ' ' roll . " trust this reformed punk music hater : call doctor worth every penny you'd spending therapy . buy it , love it , scream it , feel released	1

i fan u2 since they released their mega-hit record " joshua tree " ... since first time i heard it , i fan them ever since ... never , ever stopped fan !!!!! so many people critisized them because many paths they've taken , risks , changes , experiments , but each every single one those steps made them who they right now : most honest , bold , charismatic , energetic emotionally commited band modern rock scene . they not name , brand , empty shell : they soul !!! i think this record cleary serves example what they able communicate millions around world trascending barriers language , culture , religion or economic status ... htdaab album takes time ... it not easily absorbed just playing it once ... which perhaps what makes it so endering deep ... it album speaks flow lyrics , echoed rhythms unmistakable touch bono , edge , adam larry use sign every track ... they not lost boldness fierce lyrics war or unforgettable fire , but rather , they've chanelled them using different elements both their sound their lyrics ... i heard so many " so called " fans who rip their robes saying how much band " evolved " but ... that exactly what music .. if it produced right reasons ... music , true music , only created born part musician very core , thus growing changing him , not manifactured easily consumed product like so many bands or pseudo pop stars diluded themselves into thinking ... i'm happy , glad , thrilled u2 evolved guts not repeat themselves ... all these " fans " keep pressing band come up achtung baby part 2 or joshua tree volume 2 but what they don't realize such not possible because time passed , 4 people who created those records matured magnificent , confident , daring , still polically active band we enjoy today , without mere caricature what they back then ... so i ask all those who only critized them what they not , you actually taken time listen , really listen this record ????!!!!! i really still find it hard understand why it would considered lacking or weak after hearing tracks like " sometimes you can't make it your own " , " man woman " or " yahweh " ... not only they capture inner experiences their members , but also serve way communicate just what band gone through continues experience entity who lasted longer than many marriages nowadays ... 28 years exact since their first sessions inside larry kitchen back their home town dublin ... not affected this record either , my opinion , close-minded possibilites what true rock band should or more importantly , creativity these 4 individuals ... this record not what fans think band , but what band thinks themselves world they live ... not political enough ? how " love peace " or " miracle drug " ??? if someone not capable touched these two anthems calling attention state chaos indifference we live nowadays , i really don't think they should even try call themselves fan this band because then they don't really understand what u2 . it very well balanced album , tracks highlight magical guitar ability edge like " city blinding lights " or " crums your table " expose perfect harmony adam base larry powerful drums ... if it weren't fact bono , even edge , mastered lyric composition such rich point , sound band produces would almost danger overpowering words ... but such not case , contrary , lines come perfect time , each one entwined other , like it happens second verse " man woman " : ... but you can't numb love , only pain feel nothing all , how i hurt when i'm holding you " .... or end " original species " : ... " you'll never alone ... come now , show your soul , you've keeping your love under control " ... or " one step closer " : ... " i'm island busy intersection , i can't go forward , i can't turn back ... " if you someone new their sound , spend time cd really pay attention lyrics ... view them more dialogue you them rather than speech they trying deliver ... immerse yourself sound completely . if you long time fan then i'm sure whatever i've written somehow echoes your own opinion ... if you still continue feel like this record not what u2 " used " well ... it your loss ... thank goodness not ours :	1

it hard find more lush , more comparable voice than art garfunkel . all true garfunkel fans own this cd love giving it spin . but when we get his version tim moore second avenue , we all take deep sigh . we simply cannot understand why someone decided edit original single version this heart-wrenching , achingly beautiful ballad . we're pleading you cbs . find original full-length master this classic release it us . i know it just one song , but perhaps you could just repackage quot ; garfunkelquot ; or include it bonus cut one his solo albums . garfunkel synonomous lush sound our old vinyl 45 this no longer this incredibly hypnotic masterpiece justice . i'm sure i'm speaking many art fans . our hopes continue ... we hope someone listening	-1

austin puts it , this album ' groovy baby ' , so much so it makes you want step into time portal head back 60's! all songs album retro kitsch , which ultimately sits well movie themes . ( how hard find movie soundtrack these days ? ) what interesting note most songs covered modern day artists , which indicates some respects this 60 ' tribute ' album . standout tracks include ' carnival ' masters retro-pop cardigans , ' soul bossa nova ' legendary quincy jones ' female species ' space . this soundtrack definitely feel-good album great sing . so if you fan retro , or want album keep you optimistic frame mind ( think 60 flower power ! ) , than this soundtrack must	-1
real -- only rachmaninoff play rachmaninoff . until someone cleans up composers own recordings , we manage pretenders . course , some these pretenders given us interesting even good renditions . my opinion , phillipe entremont best , although sadly early days recordings , thus not digital . lang lang version not too bad -- yes , it overly interpretive overly expressive , but other hand , it very entertaining . recording excellent sound -- turn volume way up you'll see how well engineered it -- no fuzzes or snaps . balance orchestra soloist perfect . i bought this cd because conductor gergiev , who never disappoints . trust russian play russians ! there sections piano concerto kind weird -- due lang lang interpretations , which go off track into something new agey . it true there excess emotionalism possibly hides lack real talent pianist . this not scholarly version . other hand , it very entertaining . if you tired all " serious " versions just want enjoy this concerto , try this cd .	-1
very long time ago , i used listen whole album . but then only 2c . recently , i bought 2c my ipod . still , amazing ... intense concentration yet like flying . stands test time . i dare say masterful . anyway , i see why many say boring ... old friend who into classical/opera said same thing . i tend agree some other parts may repetitious " stoners " . i always mixed feelings verbal grunting . anyway , itunes you buy only 2c 99 cents ( w/out buy whole album ) . see yourself . i prompted write this because someone said jazz pianist better but i checked itunes me its not even close . music everyting personal preference . btw : my preference rock , zepplin , yes , etc	-1
it wouldn't long before super furry animals fills songbook vol . 2 everyone elses participation more than just playing instruments , hitting us experimental album year . this one , everyone super furry animals write sing their own songs . so it probably led you skeptical album since you thought gruff rhys absolute brains sfa , right ? lets find out , through this , i tell you who wrote this . " zoom ! " continues super furry animals love ... wordplay " i can't let enough this . kiss me apocalypse " , gruff sings passion over trip-hoppy beat may lead you expectsuch better album sfa than you would expected . " atomik lust " hits us asong just living without feel wanting , deciding right away , " lets get our *** together ; insane crackbrainz . " i know no reasoning line crackbrainz taking place but super furry mission making music not just make fun , quirky music but it bit passion , seriousness , way make you want listen this band . " horn " basically their song fun enjoying . though some may raise their eyebrows fact " lalala-lalala " there . ( even more you raising eyebrows because gruff isn't wheel anymore aren't you ? ) when i listen this , i start picturing wonderful enjoyment villages . " walk you home " , their method this go usual write song if it tries play lie real love song . more or less , song perspective shy , warmhearted man fire his heart . song kind like traditional motown back up singers playing friends saying , " you could drinking me/so why don't you go up ask ? " then , they break mood just introducing you signature super furry animals single . difference ? opening not same one video till say , 1:15 minutes ? since music thematic man who just perplexed life where everyone cares who celebrity marries . they even broke mood , clery , line : " no more romantic comedies/this fanfare introduction high-powered purposeful theme . " " frequency " song sfa kind wonders what it like their end their life or end world . fact album just guy walking around wasting precious time figuring out what heck there his life . this song also best use wordplay describe life : " you say history your judge , but jury whipped , gagged drugged . " not much pick up think but major detail so far . " oi frango " super furry animals love kraft taking off landing space funk amazement may scare you bit mind . " back roll " song best described song anyone their mind road singing , touring , living road . basically , this all written road promote their albums , but no one really heart soul sing it such manner they . i am wondering what say piece like " cloudberries " . song separated into named verses or suites all song under 8 minutes . nonetheless , you feel if you listening radio same time think they pulling off jay-z maneuver called " all around world/same song " . therefore , ending same song post-rock outlook . anyone who paying attention hos super furry ends their album , this one closes beautiful slow " cabin fever " . like end , you think you listening end , but it really closes piano line . session involving piano . if there few words i use describe this album succes this band , message best comes straight " psyclone ! " : " count your chickens , we're taking over . " ( playing : oi frango)rating : 8/10	-1
beginning one little riddle , cd just gets better better . it probably their best work . i wish it bigger hit them , because there so many outstanding tracks . i love latin soul . it so cool funky . their vocals just good ever their blend amazing . they need keep releasing new work because i end up listening their stuff so many times over over , i get too used it , need new material . i hope one day soon , they actually work like back early 90 so they'll more hits again . terri ellis best singer , but they all such excellent job	1
there people live music like this . word it unique . if you listening this stuff , you obviously know thing or two underground rap . underground hip-hop often times repetitive sloppy too . although lyrics always forefront rap music , there lot desired when it comes down production . obviously , there going lot people won't , or can't get into this record due it complexity . aesop lyrical delivery too much some people it own , let alone production . that why " labor days " " float " worked so well . blockhead genius production , although minimal , complimented aesop complicated flow brilliantly , making it much easier focus lyrical content . " bazooka tooth " other hand , bit different . production often referred futuristic , since there so many electronic sounds , bits , quirks it . now , music moves just fast aesop . his lyrics very difficult pick out unforeseen production , which obviously frustrates some listeners . i one , recommend listening this album headphones . more you listen , pick apart music like this , easier it experience their artistic vision . you fan progressive music all kinds appreciate this music . you'd probably enjoy this record more than most , if you appreciate trip-hop , house or techno music . i also like this music lot because my love progressive rock music , such yes , king crimson , emerson , lake palmer , pink floyd . if you always looking music progression , then you should appreciate unique approach aesop rock taken improve this commercially decaying genre . this album definitely heavy collaborative efforts . album recorded mixed nasa , el-p executive producer/performer ( " we're famous " ) . we also catch glimpses mr. lif ( " 11:35 " ) , camp lo ( " limelighters " ) , p.f.a.c. ( " cook it up " ) , blockhead ( producer " cook it up " , " babies guns " , " 11:35 " ) , scratching dj cip one , dj pawl , additional spots featuring cannibal ox , s.a. smash murs . standouts include " easy , " " no jumper cables , " " limelighters , " " we're famous , " " greatest pac-man victory history , " " babies guns , " " 11:35 " . keep open mind , find traits album you like expand them . keep listening , remember , good pair headphones your saving grace understanding this album little better . i absolutely love this album after 4 listens . album gets even better each listen , when given chance , it reward you beyond belief	-1
i own daydream nation , goo , rather ripped . three , i probably skip most tracks this one ( " sleepin ' around " " rats " usually , " what waste " " rapture " occasionally ) . there some really really good tracks classic sonic youth too though . " jams run free " , " incinerate " , " reena " , " pink steam " all great , " jams run free " probably my most played . if you want get into sonic youth , this good start but i'd recommend " daydream nation " starting point - it may take few more listens but overall " daydream " their best work	-1

this album so good i finally decided write review . i add some thoughts especially since some other reviews aren't positive . return cookie mountain sounds fresher than anything i heard long time . " wolf like me " amazing what drew me them first place . but it other songs hold onto you much longer . " i lover " great intro sets tone perfectly . " method " which no one here really discussed much , beautiful song layers harmony lead into wonderfully sinister drums . it kind juxtapostioning keeps you your toes through out . last part album drags bit , but it only because first part so extraordinary . if you really like eclectic beautifully crafted music you go wrong this . gets better every listen	1

mxpx great punk rock band , there no denying . this cd nice it rock much it running time . there few weak songs , but good songs made up it . compared most punk rock bands you hear mtv [ simple plan , example ] , mxpx probably up there best today punk rock genre . 1 thing i not understand life me fact mxpx considered christian band . looking their lyrics , you don't see anything even remotely related god ! their lyrics don't reflect anything christianity or any kind spirituality . their lyrics ain't no different green day lyrics or dropkick murphys ' lyrics . but , least it nice clean rock music that very enjoyable . i don't know , maybe mxpx older stuff more christian . this only mxpx album i ever bought heard . but , i won't hesistate say i like mxpx music lot . best songs album '' waiting world end '' [ best song here far ] , '' darkest places '' , '' young depressed '' , '' wrecking hotel rooms '' , '' late again '' , '' story '' . if you're looking good new punk rock release check out , i'd reccomend buying this cd , christian or non-christian .	-1

you may introduced kt through movie queen damned , award winning deus ex invisible war game , or just wandered into this review , but rest assured your ears tapping your brain pan asking some more dreamy , industrial grit only kt give . starting off , it wouldn't fair so over-zealous say this cd ' totally cool awesome ' like so many other emotional non-technical reviews here . zerospace cd deserves 4 stars mainly because sound truly unique . it sort like industrial splash techno all wrapped post nuclear , dark metal sphere . there only 5 out 13 songs any good . they : black bullet , before i'm dead , dyskrasia , glitter girl zerospace . while these still good credits band , there few technical issues some songs . first , examining good songs , i would much better if lead vocal , dominguez , not interrupted pace tempo two songs : black bullet zerospace . what she , few times both songs , she slows song down almost stop , whole " whisper effect " sequence like so many try now . this add some shock-drama song , but dominguez doesn't it very well , tempo speed songs themselves don't need it . tempo pace glitter girl good model domiguez should pay attention future , tempo speed fit character song . songs : amnzero taking train barley songs all . they represent shots techno-dream abstraction really poor songs technically ; they should axed cd . example , taking train nothing but long silence same repeated whisper lyrics ... really boring irritating . rest songs cd just ok , seem different mindset 5 other good ones . overall , cd worth buy well-earned band support ; you get 5 great songs rather than only one decent song , like so many new cds today ( damn , greedy record companies sign anybody make buck ) . if you like dark , dreamy , distorted metal , you really enjoy kidney thieves . it surely give your soul something dark , metallic , gritty chew	-1

upon first forty seconds first song , you just might tapping your foot- beat song- because pinback carries beat- song . i think i said all correctly . what i mean all this pinback not just pile different sounds meshed together make noise you see your neighborhood punks blasting late night no logical reason- oh no , pinback features melody . " concrete seconds " officially declares so . just listen guitar each song followed drums or drum machine , you might just see what i mean . well , if you haven't heard it- take my word it . so we've established this cd melody . concurrent beautiful melody , if i may say so myself . i mean , when you listen , there no loud abrupt sound make you cringe , or any ridiculous solos middle songs seem completely pointless . when you listen this cd , it seem like ...... like everything it place- right where it belongs . it carries beat too , remember , so ... you pretty good music your hands . you some differentiation well . example , " boo " very laid back easy song just listen long hours night , incorperates somewhat " drowning " feeling well . then , music switches " bbtone " , where you more preppy ( but not dancy-preppy , more like bob-your-head-and-smile preppy ) beat , becomes catchy memorable soon verse kicks . i suppose i should mention this time there amazing harminization two singers any given time , when they sing their part well . rob crow zach smith vocals soothing fluent , which perhaps makes pinback so worthy grand title . take " penelope " example- you crow singing softly , or just going " oooooooooh , realease air " while smith sings almost delicately . again , preservation melody . i also wish state this- when you listen cd , you most likely find favorite song . many prefer aforementioned " penelope " , or uncanny but delectable " prog " , or even mysterious " seville " ( sheena bella , sheena bella , name get stuck your head [ only if you decrypt lyrics ]) . i personally prefer " bbtone " myself , very gentle song " tres " , which some may consider marvelous piece it own , where piano plays major role . either way , if you give each these songs time , you most likely enjoy them all . each song seems it own ... flavor , what makes it so amazing simply ... well , simply what it . this whole cd wonderous , inspiring , vibrant , you should not miss it . pinback unique melody harmonizing vocals purely grogeous , if you allow it , they find some place your memories . or they'll just give you tingly feeling when you listen it year later ... great cd essentially	1
if there any list best lyrics song " high hopes " would probably undisputed winner . more i listen this song more i get it . every line every word seem carefully chosen . sometimes i feel how one get so perfect . may they just happen put it coincedence im just really deriving those thoughts my own scrutiny . ah ! music its just breath-taking . it definetly not inclined towards old psychedelic content which i really like but itself whole new phenomena . there seems absolutely no flaw this album all . each track leads not only musically but also meaningfully . album art too , how they pull it off ? individual tracks this album " cluster one " , " poles apart " , " high hopes " really nice listened singles . but whole album sounds great best heard one streach . album everyone no matter who you ... how old you ... or what kind music you prefer	1

judas priest rocks , ok ? rob halford rock god , he one most powerful voices heavy metal . glenn tipton k.k. downing amazing guitar players who trade leads extremely fast extremely well . ian hill great bass player . les binks isn't their best drummer , but he good . this first priest " live " album it early one . so , therefore , most songs " hellbent leather " or " stained class " or anything before . but , despite it early stuff ; this one best live albums i've ever heard . yeah , it overdubbed overproduced , but it still technically live album they're killer ! only thing you wish better set-list , but here tracks : 1 . exciter2 . running wild3 . sinner4 . ripper5 . green manalishi ( two-pronged crown)6 . diamonds rust7 . victim changes8 . genocide9 . tyrantbonus tracks : 10 . rock forever11 . delivering goods12 . hell bent leather13 . starbreakerthe live version " exciter " ten times better than studio version . i've never heard studio version " running wild " but it great . " sinner " obviously overdubbed , but it one my favorite priest songs . " ripper " very simalar " sinner " but still cool . " green manalishi " better studio , but this one cool . " diamonds rust " old joan baez song i've never heard . priest it great though . " victim changes " some great guitar playing it one my favorite priest songs although i've never heard studio version . " genocide " great solo les binks some best drumming he priest . " tyrant " weakest song . four bonus tracks some best remaster series . " rock forever " ten times better than studio version , halford voice so great this track . " delivering goods " pretty much same way . " hell bent leather " much better studio " starbreaker " awesome . this truly masterpiece far live albums go i'm sick reading reviews people who diss rob halford voice . halford so many things his voice such talented vocalist . they're people better than halford , but still ... give man some credit . grade : a+	1
super score . two standards genre : hey there hernando hideaway , but also number outstanding production numbers duets : quot ; seven half centsquot ; , quot ; steam heatquot ; , quot;i'll never jealous againquot ; , quot ; there once manquot ; . most singing excellent but sometimes i admit janis paige isn't pitch i prefer ( dare i say it ) doris day movie . john raitt professional he always . this 50 musical through through , filled serious love songs , comedy satirical bite , endless energy . extra tracks this cd nothing too wonderful , excerpts pretty banal interview composer jerry ross , but they include song you won't hear ( good reason -- despite inteviewer mike wallace glowing support it pretty bad song ) show . want know why this show so good : george abbott , john raitt , bob fosse , harold prince , adler ross , eddie foy , jerome robbins , carol haney , peter gennaro . yes , there shows power-packed line-up like , bad , but not many . enjoy memories this bring back	-1

notorious b.i.g. nor 2pac greatest all time ; not even close . who better than b.i.g. ' pac ? gza , nas , az , ghostface , big , big pun , immortal technique , redman , method man , keith murray , canibus - list goes . b.i.g. ' pac so overrated , it not even funny ; if they alive today , b.i.g. would just criticized jay-z , 2pac would just washed-up snoop dogg . yet you people can't see through this , choose worship them because they martyrs game . since stating , i feel need say doesn't mean i dislike either b.i.g. or ' pac , nor discredit them emcees . i just don't see them gods some people , who know very little hip-hop beyond 50 cents kanye wests world , proclaim they . overall emcee , b.i.g. also better two ; lyrically , 2pac simple rhyme-scheme fails miserabley comparison . i . . ' complexity , great word play . 2pac passionate delivery made up this , but b.i.g. even admittedly better , more traditional flow . b.i.g. also much more vivid imagination , intricate way stories . his production also much finer , balanced than 2pac almost strictly g-funk trunk rattlers . i know i'm going get numerous " not helpful " votes pronouncing neither b.i.g. or ' pac earned legacy they given their post-mortem life , but i'm giving you nothing more than truth this review , can't help but point out facts , especially all 2pac ****-riders inhabiting this product , carrying out beef they not around even experience , mostly due their 13-15 year old age range . said , this great release , one my favorite albums come out mafioso genre ; unfortunately , there far too much filler call this classic so many others make it out . it may not raw ready die , but works its favor more than it takes away it ; this much more mature , vibrant production musically lyrically than its predecessor . maybe rich cinematic scheme little too much people who think " ambitionz az ridah " greatest hip-hop track all-time , all albums should carry thug life tradition , but true hip-hop heads , theme carried out this album real treat . " kick door , " " hypnotize , " " last day , " " what beef , " " notorious thugs , " " going back cali , " " my downfall , " " long kiss goodnight , " " you're nobody(till somebody kills you ) " undoubtedly certified hip-hop classics . rest album , sadly , filled good tracks , filler , that why this album not five stars my opinion . if you cut off fat this prime piece sirloin , you undeniable classic ; if you leave it , you've got dozen classic tracks surrounded dozen ' meh ' tracks . end , this grand album , but double disc idea too ambitious b.i.g. this stage his career . it definitely much better product than his rival all eyez me(which fewer classic tracks , much more filler - well lacking any one theme throughout , simply thrown together ) , but it still isn't top ten , let alone top five album illustrious genre hip-hop . it recommended , just know what you're getting before hand	-1

i find it very sad when so called ' artist " lives off same tired old songs you hear endlessly your " easy listening " radio station . i mean just how many times you listen 34 year old song " american pie ? " . i saw this guy concert 30 years ago i saw him again last year he still singing same tired old songs but he put some weight . i guess when you haven't got anything original new offer muisc buying public then you just keep churning out albums same songs it . i give this album 5 stars because thankfully mr. mclean now faded into music obscurity	1

i'd never heard anything adiemus all until few weeks ago . that weird because i only listen classic radio stations . first time i heard it plane way my first real holiday 11 years . what appropriate way start it opening my eyes something incredible this . adiemus songs sanctuary terrifically energtic uplifting . main instrument peculiar , stripped down orchestra human voice incredibly wide range emotion mere sound it provoke . lyrics songs sanctuary don't mean anything , they only phonemes , but not style scat-singing , more way delivering free-roaming range emotions rather than specific point . this helped abundant freedom movement sequences keys unusual time signatures . songs sanctuary come across liberated adventurous no doubt inspire you just go out keep going going until you far away where you started . if you even stop all . yes , songs exciting always keep your attention no matter how many times you listen them . composer karl jenkins calls songs sanctuary multi-ethnical he couldn't more right . they'll take you anywhere world you want . beyond . i urge you go out this cd	1

i album couple weeks tried listen it much i could but it wasn't until just this last complete run though i really saw this masterpiece , not just work art . it though , no questions . anyone reading this already knows this very highly acclaimed i am here tell you listen everyone . this record absolutely enthralling ( glow pt . 2 ) , absolutely fun ( i felt my size ) , absolutely adventurous ( moon ) , absolutely haunting ( headless horseman ) , absolutely captivately ( something #1 ) , absolutely psycho-pop ( i felt your shape ) , absolutely ... well ... what i think we all look music . lyrics great , music spectacular , production/mix amazing . this emotional but lighthearted rollercoaster ride works individual song level but even better whole ( 66 minutes ) . i am suprized say i even like it better when turned down low since headphones optimal it . obviously , this record multidimentional	1
janet jackson success continued grow tremendously each year followed her 1986 album " control " , but mid-1997 , many her fans started notice remarkable shift janet style , image , musical direction . first single 1997 " velvet rope " rather somber hip-hop ballad called " got `til it gone " which featured rapper q-tip sample joni mitchell " big yellow taxi " . song lyrics describe failed romance imbue deep sense regret despondence . song appeared much more lethargic than janet previous hits , album extended mood even further . this album often overlooked , unfortunately , many people misinterpret what it . " velvet rope " used metaphor describe person need feel unique , protected , accepted . theme intended difficult decipher , because life often harsh amidst it difficult someone identify what makes them feel special . " velvet rope " undoubtedly janet strongest album ; running wide gamut topics overcoming grief losing loved one ( " got `til it gone " , " together again " ) , isolation despair feeling unfulfilled ( " i get lonely " , " empty " ) , domestic abuse ( " what " ) , social prejudices ( " free xone " , title track ) , self-deprecation ( " you " ) . what most critics quick note explicitly sexual lyrics many songs ( " rope burn " , " my need " , " anything " , " tonight night " ) , however , most them fail recognize songs ' connotations . lyrics not intended arouse , they used means submission distraction . songs engaging sexual activity way both punishing oneself gratifying oneself spite their lack self-worth . they represent janet attempts explore facets her sexuality she always curious but denied herself . this album flawless , aside some embarrassing unnecessary interludes . it intense masterpiece , one requires great deal patience open mind listen , but it far janet most rewarding astounding album	1
first off , this fabric cd anyone educated knows fabric night club releases string mix cd well-known artists . if you don't already know these mixed compilation cd than that your problem . getting out way , this nice job showing global communication fans exactly what tom middleton mark pritchard up these days showcasing their ever eclectic tastes . mix cd split up into two parts , first half pritchard choices second middleton . pritchard , who also records harmonic 33 troubleman , starts it off hip-hop , latin rhythms downtempo grooves leads seamlessly into middleton groovy house meanderings . personally , i appreciate what pritchard doing late more than middleton cosmos project recent obsession cheese-house but one still appreciates impeccable pastings sound these two come up ; they both ability make you appreciate sounds you don't normally give time day . end it , you still come out deep respect global communication their influence electronic music whole . if you want classic original material these guys , start digging make sure you purchase " 76:14 " , " pentamorous metamorphosis " " new school science " , just starters . just keep mind this cd not original g.c. material . however , there one new track end amba , which middleton own project one he discussing five years now . apparently , there forthcoming album amba so keep your eyes peeled	-1
any gibber can't help but think boys ' concert antics this 1989 release . this album came interesting time . andy gibb died year before , hurricane andrew devastated florida , brothers gibb relegated doing concerts disney channel . music helped boys cope difficult circumstances , one modest critical success . usual , us slightly different perception anything gibb , but first single ordinary lives hit rest world . there very cool refrain here distinct beat . sometimes song listed title cruel world parenthesis , its neat hear barry utter words song . one monster hit all hooks one could ask . boys their little one ! salutes concert , my nieces just obsessed watching it over over . one so tropical catchy great lyrics cool rifts . onto what may one steamier gibb songs , bodyguard very naughty when it released soft core music video . robin delivery form , words ones every woman wants hear . growl ! you deserve more , let me take care protect you . hot damn . its my neighborhood first departure song one . it got eighties hard edge it doesn't always suit boys . i like chorus lyrics proper element bad boy anger . not same kind growl ! bodyguard , but growl ! nonetheless . tears so real . i am not major teary eyed type person , but tears just perfect song when you need good cry . three grown men admit fact `there tears tonight ' . it okay cry , who knew ? barry delivery lyrics not ashamed it just set this kleenex keeper off . it unusual eighties see bee gees song written only pair brothers , opposed solo material where any combination brothers their teams expected . tokyo nights , however , robin maurice make very catchy tongue cheek song . it bit tribute stalwart japanese gibb fans , yet i suspect something more sinister its ambiguous lyrics . guests my car just don't understand when i sing this one . flesh blood might better robin song this album . bodyguard partly shared barry , rest album baz dominated . flesh blood this hard style album seems going , this suits robin . it similar walls eyes , perhaps album would stylized blood it full blown gibb production . nuances here delivery top notch . i recently discovered cute little opening effect wish you here i hadn't noticed until my headphones-only listen . it like carousel turns into lofty echo . barry , robin , maurice wrote this song tribute andy , it tearjerker totally real lyrics . it bittersweet . there very happy , fond , `wish you well ' type sayings mixed `don't go we'll miss you ' somberness . perfect reflection loss song . yay we come maurice moment album ! house shame usual per maurice , slightly different style than anything else one . even edgy modern stuff isn't quite like mo hooky lines here . his delivery varies verses , then he drops killer chorus you i often find stuck my head even if i haven't heard shame ages . good stuff . sometimes this trying prince stuff just much , you ever let me almost bland imitation . it its moments , it me or all choruses strong here ? song i would probably write off if it anyone else , brothers delivery hooks still bring me back . wing prayer doesn't sound like anything old fashioned , yet it reminds me old time song `coming wing prayer . ' ( i am then also remind `don't sit under apple tree anyone else but me!' but that story . ) gibb tune here bit uneven . i really like slower parts barry breathy speaking lines , but then song turn rough stuff it doesn't all seem fit . still one starts ends upbeat note , any new fans surprised find depth seriousness . special note #4356 . shape things come one these gibb oddities fans forced hunt . released arista their olympic album , song received little notice . no gibb collection , however , complete without it , or one matter . album unique look three successful men brothers , coping , crying , moving making music boot .	-1

i like some songs this album . i've fallen love ' here i dreamt i architect ' . i really admire colin meloy voice , it might just my favorite--it unusual whiny , he slurs dips vocals quite well . i'll tell you , though , one thing i don't like this album lyrics . some lines expressive wonderful , others just sappy fluffy naive . i really hate how ' leslie anne levine ' starts out , something like " hi my name leslie anne levine " . songs tell stories , actual stories , other people . i prefer words describe subject , opposed " once upon time " thing . i suggest if you pick choose songs this album ( ipod or whatever ) , instead buying whole cd . half cd beautiful , other half so-so .	-1
wow , people cite passages soundtrack heard before films 20 years ago , evidence horner ' recycling ' . i cant . i just know he handful others write most hackneyed scores around , making all films converge towards mean , become homogenized . how something original here , like music adding film providing counterpoint , displaying complexity emotion ? there many examples this , but usually not composition but incorporating world music or songs known already pop music . fact , hollywood composers cabal , ingenuity not valued . movie so so , i given this soundtrack radio station promo .... culprit danny elfman , uniformly quirky , but thats story ..	-1

i heard good things pulp so i downloaded this album . maybe i should downloaded this hardcore , which i haven't listened , since this didn't impress me . fact it bored me . its not i don't like dreary music , i like cure joy division . noting almost all , beside babies , worth buying . babies really great track i stick it mixes i make relatively often . but i found nothing else this cd made me want listen it . but i listen it , two more times fact . i still couldn't find even one more positive thing it next two times through . jarvis cocker cool singer lifts album lackluster songs half notch . but singing not real big deal me when i listen music , hardcore . good singer doesn't make band good , although it doesn't hurt any . songs try sound epic but they just come off sounding dull . like i said if you want ' good ' idea what pulp sound like this album just download babies scrap rest material because it would just waste good fifteen bucks	-1
steven martin great comedian just anyone . i am 14 years old enjoy his comedy very much . many comedians today throw too much profanity into their acts . while this funny , after while it gets old . steve martin may throw some profanity but he doesn't get old . steve martin very original man . only weak point this cd songs , martin would better doing two more comedy skits than doing songs . all all its 4 star performance	-1

two years separated " spirit " " this way " projects . time jewel took personal time reflect her fast rise one biggest singer songwriter her generation , fell love , grew person . even more importantly , jewel began writing new material . all these events this would take shape into what became " this way " . released latter half 2001 , " this way " showed slight commercial decline her two previous lp , but received rather well most critics fans . there those raised their eyebrows more " mature " jewel . one who wasn't afraid flirt different musical styles her own sensuality . " this way " finds much more wiser , yet still innocent jewel looking world more intense fashion . this intensity matched musical electicism found this lp . folk element which jewel so known still present . but , there country , rock , pop , occasional surprise elements abounding here . though i won't give it all away those who haven't heard this record . lead single " standing still " , inspired jewel relationship ty ( his last name still escapes me ) gem . jewel sings verses quiet , yet building passion . this passion erupts chorus , showcases jewel voice . " break me " , which far superior it orchestrated version here than more whitewashed single version , subtle lilting . specific enuciation words gives jewel voice charismatic purr even gritty context . this best showcased cuts such " love me ( leave me alone ) " " jesus loves you " . lyrically , jewel showed progress , but still keeps it mostly simple . though i shine spotlight " serve ego " which lyrically sparse , almost erotic reading social culture . this also her first dance hit . musically , stated , diversity handled subtle fashion . many textures very well mixed , some may not notice ( right away ) jewel hinting more adventerous musical territory . course , " 0304 " would born this flirty musical behavior . some may shun jewel use more " studio " technique . ironically , i think jewel manages meld " live energy " her first lp " studio experimentalism " her second lp quite well . two live cuts tacked onto end record , blending quite well pre-recorded studio tracks well . each track worth second spin , each one gets better spin . jewel selected strongest songs " this way " sessions , making record stands jewel catalogue her most cohesive strong . it also my personal favorite jewel whole catalogue . highly recommend anyone who loves music , everyone should hear this least once	1
this cd sooo nice ... first cut " put me " my favorite . it sounds like funk w/ hint jazz . i love his style music , even his luther remake " superstar " excellent taste	-1
jeff lynne got one most underrated pop geniuses seventies eighties . while world prog-rockers bombasting themselves side-long double album extravaganzas ( yes , i am talking yes ... ) , jeff lynne his mates electric light orchestra decided " i am walrus " " good vibrations " all inspiration they needed . end result body work sounds even better these aging ears than they 1975 . their orchestral rave-up chuck berry " roll over beethoven " " bama-lama-lama " chorus rockabilly " rock roll king , " lynne mastered styles effortlessly three decades . ( even if " zoom " not represented here . ) despite fact elo pretty much abandoned " orchestra " part their name " time , " ' pocket-symphony ' concept stayed them till last hit this cd , " calling america . " songs like " rock roll king " hint production chops lynne would eventually bring likes tom petty , travelling wilburys , george harrison dave edmunds . i chose this " essential elo " cd my collection over " all over world " primarily because this set includes " ya . " " all over world " few choice classic-rock cuts ( " ma ma belle " " diary horace wimp " name two ) , but if you're looking get sugar coated buzz 70 singles , this collection own . my rating held four stars because ommissions like " four little diamonds , " " 10538 overture " or " showdown . " ( this should double set , ala " strange magic . " ) now all albums back out pristine remasters , you pick choose classic elo fit your whims	-1
livin proof got slept harder than floor central bookings ain't nothin ' harder than clear coated stone floor ! this one my favorite albums two reasons . reason one : this arguably premier best produced album date . reason two : although group home aren't nicest ! $$az earth ( malachi borderline wack , sorry ! )the brooklyn/bronx combo manages win you over they take you lyrical cab ride through streets new york . fact , lil dap , who you may remember gangstarr " speak ya clout " " i'm man " actually pretty deep poignant lines like " i'm not killing my people but you know how it go/work wit ' me not against me we'll make mad dough " combustible single " living proof " . standout cuts include " life inner city " , " superstar " , " realness " my favorite , " up against wall ( remix ) " . pony up scratch cop this album ; must boom bap enthusiast . if not realness group home bring michael ( that microphone my retarded crew ) , then primo flawless production . i mention beats hard	-1
fred neil king east village coffee shop , pass-the-hat folksingers very early sixties this cd shows why . much his origins late life shrouded rumour mystery . sinatra , johnny cash , even jim morrison great baritone voices , but fred neil sound really something else . neil most spectacularly deep resonant baritone voice , voice would sound wonderful reading phone book ! everyone idolized him , everyone imitated him , everyone covered his songs : roy orbison , jefferson airplane , youngbloods , harry nilsson , tim buckley , tim hardin , judy henske , john sebastian , gram parsons , linda ronstadt , tom rush , roger mcguinn . unknown , awestruck , social climbing bob dylan used play backup harmonica fred neil his ringing 12 string village years before these albums . ( dylan mentions this bio pic " no direction home " ) fred one main influences david crosby , steven stills ( crosby , stills nash going call themselves " sons neil " before neil talked them out it ! ) . neil brill building song writer , like carol king , years before venturing out his own . album bursts early sixtes ( there two sixties ! ) folkie optimism energy . there much more energy precision here than " many side fred neil " which also worth . line neil song " toy balloon " ( not this cd)so impressed jefferson airplane paul kantner grace slick it found it way into " ballad you me pooneil " , fact " poohneil " combination winnie pooh gentle fred neil . see also " house pooneil corner " . bleeker macdougal neil solo includes his second most famous song " other side this life " which covered jefferson airplane nearly everyone else . ( his most famous " everybody takin me " , hit harry nilsson , story neil life . not included here ) . " blues ceiling " deep world weary quality it . " little bit rain " deeply melancholy . " sweet mama " upbeat ringing 12 string overtones . when he sings word " home " " bleeker macdougal " his voice sets up bass standing waves all over room ! famous line dating golddigging women " handful gimmie ( mouthful much obliged ) " found it way into tom rush " drop-down mama " same era . ( i don't know if it fred neil first or not ) . " yonder come blues " ( dressed high-heeled shoes) ! not bad cut this bluesy second album . fred hated music industry its commercialism . he dropped out didn't record last 30 years his life or so , living frugally proceeds " everybody talking me " , despite offers rock giants record duets again . now his incredible talent forgotten nearly all but " small band admirers ( many them stars their own right ) " . shy reclusive fred neil singer singer . just listen let voice wash over you . like deep rich chocolate . he represents skill purity folk , occational bluesy jazzy tone . this album ( or combo import " tear down walls " which includes this ) best example extant his talent . ( lost somewhere rumoured tape young bob dylan fred neil jamming ) . excellent sound this album .	1
this only album my collection i listen regular basis without ever getting bored . i ff one or two tracks generally , but this one heck album goes down great cocktail party . fact , i've never , until now , bothered write anything album . highly recommended	1
don killuminati : 7 day theory probably 2pac most intense cd . it begins " bomb first " which adrenaline packed gansta rap song actually made my hair stand end first few times i listened it . but , my hair stayed up listening " hail mary , " which eerie both beat pac lyrics . then comes " toss it up , " which disappointment probably only downside this entire album , only song i ever skip when i listen this cd ( life outlaw , because outlaws , they really way ruining perfectly good pac songs ) . rest album , however , maintains intensity raw energy 2pac , intelligent lyrics possibly best beats any 2pac album . tupac raw , energetic , powerful genius lyrically this album . if this where 2pac , or ' makaveli , ' headed , it really shame he taken away so soon .	1
key factor choosing this cd over other goodman collections emphasis jazz . goodman recorded lot if not bland , then certainly restrained commercial material his quest broad appeal . this lead false belief some he lacked ability play loose emotionalism characterize best jazz playing . this collection should help dispel idea , covering everything his early , more fervent clarinet playing his brilliance leader complex , modern arrangements . chronologically programmed , set still carefully varied sequenced play well when listening straight through . not dull cut bunch . remastering sound quality very good , although i've heard little better some columbia reissues .	1
... other album , course , " american beauty " . this album works so well because once these loveable long-haired , dope-smoking , acid-dropping , heroin-injecting , coke-snorting , whiskey-swilling , barbituate-injesting hippies decided forsake their nauseatingly self-indulgent free-form jam tendencies ( see " live dead " ) craft straightforward , unpretentious , no-nonsense album mellow acoustic rock . if you wanting introduce friend grateful dead first time , this record you throw turntable . " casey jones " " uncle john band " most popular cuts , but there not single bad track here	1

alright , reading some these whiny one star reviews makes me want take hammer my skull while watching old " wings " re-runs . once again i read paragraph after paragraph sayng how korn changed why dont they go back their roots blah blah blah , yet these same people hated take look mirror which closest their self titled debut , or their roots even still these same people , there seem many them , say korn not anything good since follow leader . truth told follow leader korns worst effort date . yet sadly its all many " fans " hold nowadays . every korn album ingenious creative its own way exception i stated , follow leader , which more like rap album god awful fred douche , err i mean durst . now far this new effort , coming undone bonus track eaten up inside , which belonged main album , 2 standouts syotos . liar cool track . only songs i truly could not stomach listen more than once or twice politics tearjerker . this album must if your really into korn raw emotion thought they put into their trend setting music . there noticeable absence " head " which , while unfortunate he gone , doesnt detract syotos any way hopefully korn keeps pumping out album after album . god bless kor	1

although there mixed views this album , i am one those who like it very much . fact i would put it my top 5 albums 2006 ( either number 4 or 5 ) . yes , there some moments where slightly weird , wacky , german edguy humor just bit too much , but there some outstanding tracks this album well which make it worthy purchase edguy fans or fans melodic hard rock/metal . me edguy always sounded like cross iron maiden/bruce dickinson def leppard , their previous albums leaning more towards iron maiden/dickinson type metal sound def lappard type hooks melodies . " rocket ride " though , they moved away sound bit , this time leaning more towards def leppard type commercial sound . that not say though edguy " wimped out " , some tracks " rocket ride " really powerful sound . album kicks off bang " sacrifice " , 8 minute mix light shade , piano , power riffs , pumping beat , hooks melodies all edguy fans love . this one stand out track . title track also one albums best , fast paced rocker mellow moment reflection middle which builds up before guitar solo , then track bursts pace again . " wasted time " classic . intro high atmosphere , it builds up anticipation before big riffs come . then we get acoustic guitars soft vocal before track again rocks great chorus sing . again , killer guitar solo mellow moment middle before it kicks off again chorus . wow , this track good ! " matrix " good track , but not good first three . this one more commercial its sound , but it good chorus . " return tribe " song isn't too bad , but it isn't stand out . it typical fast paced edguy rocker . " asylum " clocks over 7 half minutes , my favorite track album . like some other tracks album , this one which builds up mix light shade . starting acoustic guitar vocals only , it sounds quite mellow if it going ballad . but then you tell way sammet builds up vocals something big coming , man ... it sure . high pitched wail , power riffs drums kick , followed more mellow , melodic verse . then power builds up again chorus . this track high intensity power . break/guitar solo starts off mellow builds up per formula song , finish powerfully . i think this one edguys best songs ever , i love it . " save me " ballad , very good one , perhaps edguys best ballad so far . " catch century " pretty good track , more hard rock type song than metal . it finishes bit wacky edguy humor but this doesn't detract what good song . " out vogue " nothing fantastic , but it not too bad . just average edguy rocker . " superheroes " track picked single , so you would expect it very commercial its sound . it guitar part which sounds like theme music comic book hero tv show or something , but it fits well song . there chorus which you just can't help singing , one better tracks album but not meant taken too seriously . " trinidad " cr #p . this prime example edguy humor too much . it obviously intended joke song , but it just over . little bit humor okay , but this isn't funny even if lyrics serious style song doesn't appeal me caribbean type sound it . this sort song should relegated bonus track end album , or bonus track single if they feel need it all . " #cking fire ( hair force one ) " . title like it obvious this example edguy humor . however this one better than previous because least this one some power song you find yourself singing chorus ! i got digi-pack version this album which also bonus live track " land miracle " . nothing special this track , it ok , but live ballad ? not good choice bonus track . conclusion , this album some excellent tracks which really stand outs , some others which pretty good too . however what lets it down finish . finish off these joke songs just silly idea itself , it this prevents me giving album 5 star rating . this shame because album deserve better finish after so good up until then . i also recommend getting " superheroes " ep if you like this album . it four non-album tracks plus piano only version " superheroes " which sounds really good . non-album tracks quite good , especially " judas opera " which michael kiske sharing vocals song many changes it . fact , i like these songs better than those end album itself !	-1
after watching ken burns jazz series last month , i went back period came up short programming - 70 - 80 . series ran theme jazz died 70 . teenager who discovered quot ; conference birdsquot ; during this time , i disagree critics . jazz not die , it evolved . this recording beautiful classic example evolution . evolution still going today , 2001 . listen this cd then follow it playing holland latest recording quot ; prime directive . quot ; dave still evolving spinning out classics . no other bassist/composer i heard last 25 years spins out more intriguing music than holland . his bass playing crystal clear very strong , while his compositions structually complete . he always works first-rate artists who continuously challenged , they respond kind taking compositions their highest level . quot ; conference birdsquot ; one most beautiful compositions i ever heard . 70 2001 - holland still evolving artist . keep up excellent work dave . long cats like you around , jazz good hands	1

it surprises many people learn there no definitive version handel " messiah " . everyone knows version they heard growing up , or version they sang when they younger . however , scholar trying put together historically informed performance this most important work faced many choices even more questions . you use score he wrote 1741 but never performed , or adaptations he made dublin premier . or maybe you want version used london premier 1743 . if you , you also reconcile reality handel later abandoned these additions changes . while work settled into more less standard form 1750s , handel still made changes based upon singers players available . these just beginnings alternatives scholar consider . this performance attempts recreate specific performance work handel 5 april repeated 15 may 1754 . wonderful notes included this recording fully explain what this choice means provides insight into each pieces well text german french well english . this recording 1980 notes say it first complete historically informed recording . this time great experimentation thought early music , especially baroque . we performance complete messiah here ann arbor december 1980 too great number these same issues . we also fortunate emma kirkby sing here ( she absolutely wonderful ) well other fine soloists . we recording part work well regarded its time . this recording also makes interesting choices composition chorus vocal style soloists . chorus choir christ church oxford uses mostly boy trebles altos young men tenors basses . they sing great clarity while they may not provide massive sound some might wish , i found straight voices quite wonderful very high registers where voices vibrato might smear or timbre might become bit shriek . this composition choir handel used this performance , so it authentic . however , it also not only kind choir he used performances this work . i enjoyed this sound very much . they also pull off quite powerful effects " hallelujah chorus " " worthy lamb " . soloists also use much different vocal production style than you might expect . remember , verdi still more than century future . big brilliant voices we expect today not rule may not invented yet . this smaller voice most pronounced tenor voice paul elliott . he certainly gets all notes very expressive , but his not brilliant voice we usually associate " ev'ry valley " . judith nelson emma kirkby share duties expanded soprano role this piece both very fine . i admit my personal bias towards kirkby . carolyn watkinson superb alto , david thomas just terrific bass " trumpet shall sound " turn . orchestra brilliant , tight , constant delight this piece . just hear them all their varied approaches texts these pieces worth hearing this disk . now , this likely not " messiah " you grew up nor what you expect when you hear this work . i urge you expand your palette . there no " right " way play work . yes , there lots wrong ways , but this not one those . one problems listeners getting too settled recording work they happen . this always mistake . no single approach enough any fine work let alone one cultural artistic magnitude " messiah " . other source mistaken fixation version you grew up or heard impressionable youth . again , i urge you re-open your approach musical taste sample this work see if you appreciate all fineness this recording offer . if you , you not only better off because your ability appreciate music expanded , but you take fresh ears back your favorite version hear it new delights doubly rewarded	1

i came this album very early my jazz listening career ( taking baby steps out ken burns cradle ) . i bought it right after " moanin '" because seemed like logical thing . let me tell you , this album huge shock after " moanin '" if you're not prepared it . while " moanin '" excursion groove , swing , in-the-pocket hard bop , " night tunisia " forward-looking powerhouse isn't accessible but just amazing . reason this change traced primarily passage two years presence wayne shorter who , , always ahead his time . though he contributed only one tune this session , " sincerely diana , " tune his others like it moved jazz messengers much closer cutting edge new harmonic language would become post-bop . his szxophone playing also much drier more angular than his predecessor , benny golson . initially , this turn-off me , it casual jazz listener . wayne shorter takes time appreciate but he truly one greatest geniuses jazz ever known . other reviewers said , title track long , intense affair highlights art blakey drive power drums . but it features great playing all group , lee morgan cadenza near end art cheering him one great moments jazz messengers history . other tunes , " so tired , " " yama , " " kozo waltz , " definitely hard-bop vein but they predict innovations come following years . since this album not immediately accessible " moanin '" some others , get " moanin '" first , then get " big beat , " also shorter present . then check out " like someone love , " same session this one . if you like all those albums , then get this one . level musicianship superb art blakey drumming superhuman its drive	1

i love foo fighters ... their live show breathtaking their music , equally powerful . despite their grand career , i believe their best cd released their sophomore effort ! cd opens up slow ... beautifully crafted song called doll ... kinda ... lulls you sleep almost . but then you're just jolted sent flying across room opening riff monkey wrench you're set ride never cease stop . every song here absolutely stellar so much talent . each song so different than next , it quite beautiful thing . one greatest slow songs ever created song walking after you , it simply amazing how song so pretty , but so " your face " like eternal everlong . it generally cheap ... it pretty much necessity any music lovers library . colour shape deserves unsurmountable praise your undivided attention ... enjoy	1

i happily discovered this album accident borders chicago back summer ' 98 it since become one more favorite offbeat albums my collection . music once funky , energetic , bouncy , plain out fun . quot ; salty peanuts/chocolate covered nutquot ; quot ; cabbage rollquot ; both upbeat fun songs show rhyming ( adequately handled dirty mf mc duty ) go quite well jazzy beat . there also some great slowed down ramp ; bish tracks like quot ; i want you want mequot ; , which probably best track album . overall , this unique sound any jazz fan should enjoy	1
neither fish nor flesh downfall it lack real commercial singles certain jealous sony labelmate sabotage if you believe terence himself . that not say music here any worse overall than hardline . unofficially stevie wonder summer soft sampling quot ; know someone deeplyquot ; , motown-esque quot ; billy don't fallquot ; gospel attack quot ; i don't want bring your god downquot ; some favourites mine . don't believe hype , there no dramatic artistic post-hardline disaster	-1

herbie alway his hand pulse music , especially cutting edge stuff . he hooked up bill laswell just when laswell started incredible run " production jobs " continues through 90 , beyond . it hard figure just who get most credit here . who cares ? if you like it , dig ! if you don't think it " jazzy " enough , that cool too , because it very hip-hop/beats oriented ( no guest " raps " but some cool soul vocals ) . jazz artist incorporating use turntables whole array synths such -- read liner notes all folks who appear here . one can't expect " kind blue " now you ? get funked up	1
if there band defined what 70 rock all , it taste . they've often called ireland answer britain superstar band cream . i think they better than cream every way . rory gallagher guitar , john wilson , formerly them drums , ex spencer davis bassist charlie mccracken , they considered hottest live act europe time . big reason this gallagher improvisational abilities six string . there nothing fancy this band . they didn't wear matching suits or psychedelic clothes popular attire day . they just hard workin ' blue collar band gallagher wearing his trademark red flannel shirt stage his lunch pail called ' 61 fender stratocaster . gallagher different than superstar guitar players time like clapton , page , peter green , who got lot their influences muddy waters , howlin ' wolf school chicago blues . gallagher loved southern rural/ country blues son house big joe williams . it shows here feelgood acoustic song quot;i'm movin ' onquot ; equally wonderful quot ; hailquot ; where he sings note note his guitar . trademark sound taste though blues rock . gallagher most aggressive guitar player i've ever heard blues rock genre . good examples this opener quot ; blister moonquot ; quot ; born wrong side townquot ; . but he also get very creative , catchy quot ; railway gunquot ; . killer tune it numerous rhythm changes . he also shows his creative side jazzy quot ; it happened before , it'll happen againquot ; , which taste most experimental song . it really swings , it probably gallagher finest moment six string . only knock i here same one other reviewers pointed out . he shouldn't picked up alto sax he just learning play attempted solo . but hey , it 70 . they those things . sometimes they worked , sometimes not . but that only knock i this excellent best collection . if you want hear why rory gallagher considered many one alltime best guitar players , just check this album out . it should all lovers classic rock wish lists	1
i never heard gabriel dresden before ; my music tastes more mainstream pop/ electronica oriented - pet shop boys , depeche mode , new order . one club fm , best internet radio , recently started play dangerous power featuring jan burton . i immediately fell love . song itself wunderland ; it enigmatic piece dreamland journey both powerful feeling voice great burton but it mix cicada- song album version really sucks when compared mix- then why bother release album , or , more precisely , why we bother buy them ? i came here buy album , excited song , thinking i would hear more precious sounds . then i listened trial album version i hear jan burton sure it same song . album version simplydull , dull , dull !!!. i heard other tracks , too they also simplistic ; like rice not cooked enough ... unfinished symphony . they need good mixes some them certainly receive . so i gave up . wait remixes . ilo ( or their label ) same thing poetica- all those good singles their simplistic form . course i not even bother buy it though rapture one my favourite songs 200 0s.i generally tend support my favourite groups or ones i like : return joyous times i heartily agree pay few dollars more but this case i not . music industry getting more voracious ? i don't wanna pay fifteen bucks album full demo-like pieces then pay again remixes . that why i downloaded only cicada mix dangerous power- however , it both band music lover loss : band loses money , music lover misses all those songs could really great . my advice : download great remix version wait other remixes skip album	-1
i know many who only know metheny work within context pat metheney group would not understand what truly great musician pat metheny . but pat metheny authentic jazz setting , his trio work , or true jazz cohorts ( herbie hancock , chick corea , dave holland , jack dejohnette , etc . ) , my opinion , one most , if not most harmonically complex , dexterous , fluid jazz guitarist world . any his trio albums demonstrate this , all nothing short inspirational amazing if you love jazz guitar	1
following breakup eagles , don henley would embark what would slowly become very successful solo career . 1980s , henley would release three albums . his first effort 1982 " i can't stand still " . this effort would produce classic tune called " dirty laundry " which henley poked fun " pretty faces " doing tv news . two+ years later - 1984 , more successful follow-up " building perfect beast " would produce three more singles " all she wants dance " , " sunset grill " , " boys summer " . " boys summer " mega-hit henley boosted award winning music video . following " building perfect beast " , henley would take nearly 5 years make his next effort . 5 year effort made henley would not disappoint - his 1989 effort entitled " end innocence " would become his most successful solo effort date . each don henley solo albums would more successful both commercial sales criticial acclaim standpoint . " end innocence " marked peak don henley solo career broke him out mold eagles put him his own two fee t.t here three factors make " end innocence " great album . first , songwriting standpoint - henley company some his best work . second , production standpoint . danny kortchmar brought co-producer henley 7 10 songs . kortchmar collaborated henley his two previous albums songwriter . kortchmar continues collaborate henley several tunes , but now moves into role main co-producer . kortchmar previous work henley makes him natural fit he able get most out don henley talents . finally , his previous studio albums - henley brings all-star lineup musicians - past , present , future . this lineup musicians help augment henley talents even more make this such great release . lineup musicians includes : bruce hornsby , mike campbell ( tom petty heartbreakers ) , patty smyth ( scandal ) , axl rose ( guns roses ) , jeff porcaro david paich ( toto ) . lineup includes three woman who would become big stars 90s : melissa etheridge , edie brickell , sheryl crow . bruce hornsby co-writer , producer ( this one non-kortchmar produced song ) , pianist " end innocence " . hornsby trademark piano playing combined henley vocals make this classic . lyrics make lot use metaphors . although much different sound than 1984 " boys summer " , song still much retro-qualities " boys summer " . " how bad you want it " very underrated tune . it probably one best songs album co-written henley , kortchmar , stan lynch . there some great horn work terrific drum work . patty smyth plays key role background vocals fold perfectly when needed . although not strong song " how bad you want it " , third track " i not go quietly " makes good use background vocals well . henley kortchmar collaboration , this strong uses axl rose background vocals he goes perfectly hard rock edge this song . despite kortchmar solid influence , collection best track " last worthless evening " wasn't kortchmar collaboration songwriting or production standpoint . mike campbell john corey ( corey stan lynch wrote produced this henley ) provide some terrific guitar work . acoustic sound makes this song special . this song , don sings this song himself woman who broken up someone don feels he fill void woman life . best part song bridge middle song goes " time time ticking ... " . this song classic . " new york minute " written 1989 henley , kortchmar , jai winding . it truly great song features toto jeff porcaro drums toto david paich piano . this song terrific haunting quality . what nobody would realize how this song would almost become soundtrack state new york city following world trade center attack . lyrics such " harry got up .... went down station ; he never came back " " lying here darkness ; i hear sirens wail " examples this . paich also contributes piano " little tin god " . " little tin god " deals evangelists healers . this best way describe this song sound folk-like quality applied harder rock edge . edie brickell melissa etheridge contribute background vocals " gimme what you got " . because kotchmar guitar , this song almost john fogerty sound it - much like you hear " centerfield " . sheryl crow contributes background vocals " if dirt dollars " . this song also fogerty like quality . both songs may fogerty sound , but they also explore fogerty-like topics materialism greed . collection wraps up " heart matter " . this song almost seems like perfect " wrap-up " like song . mike campbell plays guitar keyboards co-writer producer henley this track ( also kortchmar co-produces ) . don sings lost love he explores see what went wrong getting " heart matter " . campbell work guitar keyboards really foundation this song . liner notes this collection contain lyrics all songs . production songwriting credits also included . collection also nice job listing studio musicians . overall , this solid effort don henley - highly recommended	-1
quot ; head heartquot ; possibly one most beautiful , haunting songs i ever heard . music lyrics create perfect image someone struggling love reason . chris de burg never dull or predictable , but i think this far his best creation	1
if ever there underrated musician , it joe farrell . his technical abilities tenor soprano saxes exceptional . his flute playing abilities equally good . funny thing joe could easily great classical flute player well . this album presents more straight-ahead farrell great contribution legendary trumpeter freddie hubbard underrated great , george cables . listening joe ballad quot ; when you're awakequot ; , sadly reminds us loss this great musician such early age . those you who enjoy farrell straight-ahead dates such this one , you should check out quot ; skateboard parkquot ; dates art pepper . joe jazz giant . true italian stallion saxophone	1

if , like me you consider tempest-soft machine-tony williams-uk period " golden years " allan holdsworth , then there no earthly reason you not buy this cd . it logical progression material first heard " bundles " brilliant live showcase his then blossoming guitar technique . i'm not your typical " prog/fusion " fanatic feels any rock presented jazz/classical bent it stretched 10-20 minutes ( flower kings - boring ) nectar gods . i'm 56 this type music since beginning quite frankly , style structure don't hold much water me unless there abundance substance soul well ( dream theater or anekdoten ) . that what left me so cold when it comes most holdsworths post uk work - lots technique presented group highly talented sidemen devoid any soul or sense collaborative effort or destination . sure , he play fast more notes than any other living guitarist , but where passion soul ? this cd different story . soft machine firing all five cylinders here aside slightly muddled recording/mix i am loss find anything negative say it . even john marshall drum solo holds up pretty well . there few weak moments but those more than offset brilliance collective talents band this live setting . speaking john marshall , why , much like jon hiseman , he unknown except select few outside confines europe ? his playing never ceases amaze me . no individual track dissertations here ... anyone reading this probably already knows material players . if you're looking prime holdsworth grab this wonderful cd while it still available .	1

it simple really . just put together great tunes fine musicians ; stir judicious mixture traditional recently-penned music - making sure you include couple memorable songs - you altan album . it formula kept donegal group near top irish traditional folk 20 years . after all time you could forgive them if their 10th album showed signs staleness or repetition . instead , absolutely contrary , " local ground " exudes freshness pared-back honesty must envy those who yet master altan " simple " formula . beautifully simple gaoth dobhair song " arise now dress yourself " - which we heard clannad decades ago - opens album sounding crisp new if it just minted . other trad . songs , including " adieu , my lovely nancy " , " amhran pheadair bhreathnaigh " " wind rain " , also delivered straightforward grace strength mairead ni mhaonaigh . jigs , reels other tunes mostly " trad : arr . " , beautifully played , twin fiddles , accordion fretted instruments taking turns feature . alongside these older tunes stand wonderful pair more recent efforts , one band member daithi sproule ( " roseville " ) other rising legend peadar o riada ( " sport " ) . each stakes claim album most memorably jaunty tune . if pushed i'd say beautifully crisp mandolin work ciaran curran , which defies feet remain still , inclines my vote towards " sport " . album title implies , altan gone back their roots this effort , donegal music strong feature . result " local ground " exudes powerful fresh energy their tradition , re-launches band into part stratosphere inhabited precious few others folk scene .	1
this cd stunning debut recording one most gifted young guitarists appear some time . her technical abilities highest level . anyone play prelude 4th lute suite this briskly musically above most criticism . i playing 4th lute suite thirty years myself . now , course ana vidovic lots room grow aesthetically -- how could it not so , she made this recording before she twenty years old ? example , sonata romantica suffers bit excess impetus . she almost never lets music breath this music , hommage schubert it , expansiveness inherent style . but let us also praise her choice repertoire . she unerringly chosen very fine pieces repertoire , which not always case . her walton bagatelles remarkable , showing panache we used hearing only julian bream , whom they written . one thing ana vidovic spades real ear harmonic progression -- this one many things sets this recording apart many others those velocity fingers little else . so , my advice purchase this recording . i doubt very much you regret it you hearing lot more this artist over years	1

i've always enjoyed admired jewel singer/songwriter contemporary folk artist , but this impressive album , which i still haven't tired , given me new found respect her talents ability continually evolve challenge herself artist . those who wrote her off just pretty blond singer some thoughtful folksy tunes , this cd make you sit up take notice . it definately shows ' jewel ' slightly harder , sharper edge , much more upbeat , urban sound both musically vocally . though she undeniably , always intelligent songwriter knack observing human social foibles , these songs less naive , far more mature ' rock chick ' feel sound than previous tracks , whilst still maintaining country girl freshness natural sex appeal underneath . its very all american ' road trip ' kind feel ( i love playing it car ) , travels white middle class america , ' trailer trash ' southern bible belt , it could almost written film soundtrack , or accompanied documentary tour . exploring such topics , religious hypocracy ( jesus loves you ) , well social poverty human deprivation , ( wild west ) , not forgeting usual pitfalls love relationships ( break me ) , detached but insightful observation gives album its edge originality . then there more bittingly sarcastic sendups human ego nature ( everybody needs someone sometime , love me , just leave me alone ) . fact there barely weak track this album . ' standing still ' , more ' pop ' genre its catchy bridge uplifting chorus , great opener first single ; ' you want play ' great energy catchy hook , while ' i won't walk away ' movingly tender love song very suited jewel beautiful voice . ' serve ego'(a song which appears kind ritualistic hedonism youth culture : " .. underneath disco light everybody feeling alright . get your hands knees praise new deity .. " she sings ) standout track , very sensual moody , relying exotic rhythms more than lyrics . ' this way ' definately terrific assortment tracks , borrowing variety influences inspirations swing country rock pop folk . not just devoted fans , it continues show jewel quality singer/songwriter developing music artist , many strings her bow .	1

immortal rivers cuomo his first-rate crew strike again weezer forth installment . maladroit loud , catchy hell leaves lasting impression listeners . weezer played their cards just right this one : initial flop pinkerton left band dead water ; they left flummoxed , heartbroken desperate need booster their discography . thus began weezer phase two : they go work recording two albums one session , putting their two strongest singles , `hash pipe ' `island sun , ' green album , which would debut first . these singles revitalization pinkerton popularity second generation weezer-faithful re-establishes band kings pop-rock -- title not held since `buddy holly ' era . but course , rivers never dies surprises ; he puts bulk band best work second release -- maladroit . where green album carried reputation just few tracks , maladroit contains 13 consistent , powerful songs , becoming hardest-rocking album weezer discography process . album relatively raw comparison former works , less lyrical , mainly focusing massive riffs (`fall together ' ) huge choruses (`take control ' ) . tight hooks `possibilities , space rock ' passionate anthem `slob ' stress integrity lighter numbers `burnt jamb , december , ' concert staple `death destruction . ' prove consistency ? make best weezer playlist i'll bet you struggle find right maladroit songs because each quality next -- `dope nose , ' possibly best riff weezer existence , closest album comes stand out , but there plenty others could take crown , namely drum giant `american gigolo ' blissful `keep fishin '' . personal note , `burnt jamb ' reaches number 8 my all-time favorite weezer songs ; that really high , especially deep cut such this . it personal favorite since album release , its climatic harmony after each chorus its happy-go-lucky " i'd happy/for one moment/of my lifetime .

without question , elvis most anthologized artist nearly thirty years since his death . so how this collection different others ? short answer -- nothing . if you're die-hard fan , there no reason buy this . but that not true casual fan who looking comprehensive overview perhaps most influential performer 20th century . this mid-priced two-disc collection covers every aspects elvis career , beginning his first sun single " that all right " through 1977 single " moody blue , " which topped country chart just months before his death . hits every stage his career--50 rock ' ' roll classics like " hound dog , " movie hits like million-seller " viva las vegas " comeback hits like " suspicious minds " ( his first no . 1 more than seven years ! ) . sure , there missing tracks ( including nine no . 1 , like " ( let me your)teddy bear , " " stuck you " " good luck charm " ) , but casual fan who only wants one anthology their collection this works nicely . however , total playing time less than two hours , it could more inclusive . highly recommende	-1

any pop album new millenium ached more beautifully than this one ? if you've ever liked annie lennox work , either eurythmics or solo artist , you're probably gonna like this one . if you've ever your heart broken , you're gonna feel it too . if you're currently throes heartbreak , well baby , you're gonna feel it your bones . whole disc painful dissolution love . tempos here generally slow , befitting subject matter , but melodies arrangements beautiful . lyrics intricate confessional , rarely resorting tried-and-true sentiments lesser pop . musically lyrically , " bare " mature work , chronicling aftermath lost love . there passion pain aplenty . regret , bitterness , despair , hope -- it all here . adding impact these spell-binding songs voice . ( i've never understood why lennox often mischaracterized ice-queen . too cerebral ? too british ? too androgynous ? ) perhaps her singular alto just leaves some people cold , but lennox gotta most soulful white girl since dusty springfield . if she lacks raw power some bigger-voiced i.e. " blacker " singers , she more than makes up difference her phrasing inflection . oh annie belt it out good , but she also knows power whisper . not only lennox singing here possibly most emotive she ever recorded , but her voice sounds like it stellar shape . suppleness control her singing throughout disc revelation , especially considering she sounded like she'd lost some flexibility range eurythmics ' fine 1999 reunion disc " peace . " no such signs vocal fatigue here . she superb voice . only disc sparse closing track she sacrifice her vocal fine-tuning , chilling dramatic effect . times complex intricate , " bare " hypnotizing pop . tuneful , addictive deeply affecting . solo masterpiece lennox . oh such gorgeous heartbreak .	1
upon listening first proper record tears fears nearly 14 years i not sure what expect . after curt smith roland orzabal went their seperate ways i remained die hard orzabal fan he continued tears fears . i still bought everthing smith released but not impressed . orzabal ( brains behind duo ) released some outstanding music but there element pop missing his work . when he smith reunited it promised more familiar album tears fears . my first listen i thought i listening beatles record convinced exception orzabals trademark powerful vocals proving i not . my first thought ... damn it they it again ! these guys write bad music ? well , then i remembered track " way you " thought , yep they ;) album opens title track it eerie how much this track sounds like graduate ( orzabal smith previous band before they became tears fears ) yet still sounds so damn paul mccartneyish same time . i astounded second track single " closest thing heaven " , some most powerful piano work i ever heard orzabal powerful singing smith joining chorus i said my self ... welcome back tears fears - you missed ! " call me mellow " lead single album world fun middle aged man grappling feelings attracted much younger woman . it amazes me this song not number one this catchiest song i heard years very well . " size sorrow " comes number 3 album my least favorite track album . orzabal penned this tune years , ago but smith took role singer this one . haunting " who killed tangerine ? " next this one standout tracks album . this song just terrific no better way say it . this song found mild success drew barrymore jimmy fallon flick " fever pitch " used promo ad espn . " killing kindness " standout track album feels like orzabal solo tff sound ( bit harder aggresive ) wasted not single . " quiet ones " contender single one my favorites album . this tune ( also very catchy ) takes life it own showcases talents orzabal smith . " who you " came next this only other song smith took lead singer job fantastic song written smith years earlier orzabal twist . " devil " brilliant play words ways reminds me tears earlier track " prisoner " hurting . bit different everything album but yet manages fit nicely other songs just same . " secret world " best track off album uses full orchestra you really feel collabaration orzabal smith this masterpiece . " ladybird " interesting song , smith who wrote chorus unable come up rest song orzabal brilliant songwriter he wrote seemingly different song go smith chorus it worked ! this great track truly co-written two talented musicians . album closes " last days earth " woderful finish masterpeice . all all tears fears back better than ever . reunion this two childhood friends reason celebrate among us tears fears fanatics . one only hopes this talented duo not make this happy ending contiues write perform . duo toured succesfully around world second leg america 2004/2005 news they performing night poms through october november 2006 we only hope more music tears fears . yes this album absolutley recommended !	1
good example one those bands defy easy categorization . if you like celtic bluegrass , maybe little bit gospel , blues , country , folk , pop , this band worth listen .	1

i offspring fan many years . i listened every one their albums serveral times over this one came out top all rest . my opinion , albums greatest least ( not counting their greatest hits album ): 1 . ignition2 . self titled3 . smash4 . ixnay hombre5 . americana6 . splinter7 . conspiracy onenote i am judging album whole , not just best songs . ignition not single " space filler " song . it raw , 90 punk rock , consistant album . some disagree this best bunch argue smash . i agree smash amazing songs like " self-esteem " , " come out play " , " gone away " , many others helped boost offspring mainstream . but not every song smash absolutely good . " dirty magic " best song cd , if not best offspring song all time . i think it overlooked underrated . ignition starts off dexter yelling " f**k " shows you album goes then . " session " first song cd one top songs cd . there many great catchy songs then . then hits more emotional , dark , mysterious song " dirty magic " . then it moves into drug song album which " hypodermic " . after comes pyromaniac loving song , " burn it up " . " no hero " also great example how offsping turn simple chug riff into something amazing . " l.a.p.d. " offsping like " f**k police " n.w.a. catchy song comes after called " nothing something " . what better way end cd great song like " forever day " . sure this album no sgt . pepper , but no one touched beatles . so i highly reccomend this album people who heard offspring before . but if you just starting enter offspring world , i would suggest smash better feel . after you get ignition if you really like it , their self titled right up there it	1
ms. proctor lovely voice wonderful ear candy even if her songs didn't depth , which they . it unfortunate her best singles , especially " me emily " probably won't get airtime they deserve they good old boy network country western music . this song could easily cross charts hopefully . highly recommend !	1
i love this disc . cannot play it enough i think sister hazel just taking off . stay tuned	1
this got offspring best album ever ! classics " come out play " , " self esteem " this classic ! " gotta get away " , " bad habit " , " nitro ( youth energy ) " couple more great songs this cd . so if you're thinking listening any offspring albums - this should definetly your first choice ! songs beginning better than ways later album . time relax : 10/10 just good intro , because you no clue what expect next ! nitro ( youth energy ): 10/10 awesome drum roll beginning ! it great sound - tone ! bad habit : 10/10 some dexter clever lyrics how lame * ss drivers tick him off ! gotta get away : 10/10 awesome song ! great vocals , guitars - etc .! genocide : 8/10 yeah good song , i guess it grow yousomething beleive : 7/10 not best song . it just wierd sound . come out play ( keep ' em seperated ): 10/10 holy [ ... ] - best offspring song ever ! lyrics so true . beat rythmn make you like song - guitar riffs make song fun . self esteem : 10/10 one their greats ! bassline makes song 20 times better - it hard just not like song!it'll long time : 7/10 not best . killboy powerhead : 9/10 i just like song overall . what happened you ? : 6/10 me this one those songs i'll probably only listen once or twice my whole life ... i don't think ska thing working great them ... so alone : 7/10 nothing really hits me this song . not one : 7/10 same . smash : 10/10 one my personal favorites , because ... whatever reason - i honestly not know ..	1
steel pulse " ultimate collection " very nice collection group best work island their early years . this reggae classic late 70 period . lot music timeframe pretty good stuff across board . steel pulse no exception . it very relaxing , even when it sometimes politcal its message . cd missing few good songs when they switched labels early 80 though . i would recommend this fans bob marley peter tosh . it similar style reggae . good music calming down .	-1
he once beatles ' lead guitarist -- brilliant songwriter his own right -- but mid-1980s , george harrison once lively successful solo career free-fall . after series lackluster albums plummeting sales , " quiet one " seemed retreat further into gardening formula one racing , until he hooked up electric light orchestra maestro jeff lynne embarked recording process produced perhaps his best solo work , 1987 cloud nine . harrison songwriting playing completely invigorated producer lynne " gee-whiz " can-do attitude studio -- he mile-high afro aviator shades challenged harrison aim ever higher , while same time setting him ease reminding him he , after all , deservedly one rock major icons . lynne strategy worked , harrison never sounded more self-assured or downright joyous than he here cloud nine . this case , you judge contents this album its cover -- blinded harrison mighty grin get swept up joy within . perhaps most telling , delightful , track over-the-top beatles homage , " when we fab , " where george humorously , wistfully , wisely comes terms his larger-than-life legacy ... where fab fan #1 lynne finally gets get his total beatlesque freak . every bell whistle thrown into production this number , kitchen sink , tangerine trees , more than few cellophane flowers . it far best beatles song beatles never recorded , better than most ones they . gear , baby ! course , even bigger smash hit here #1 " got my mind set you , " no matter how often i hear it , i can't help but get happy . mentioned other reviews , video complete delight -- hilarious , self-mocking , surreal , magical . lynne kicky arrangement harrison spirited singing re-awaken this old rock chestnut make it tune ages . it swings swoops makes you want backflips out your wingback chair . title track edgy blues number works its way under your skin winning way , while " if that what it takes , " " this love , " " fish sand " luscious mult-layered pop highest order , could ( should ) massive hits , each one . harrison delivers gorgeous melody sensitive vocal " just today , " then spirited rocker " devil radio " ( more shoulda-been hits ) , moody " someplace else . " i love fiesty " wreck hesperus , " which prototypical harrison cranky humor defiant rocking , which " breath away heaven " beautifully delicate love song sonically rooted heart asia . bonus tracks , they interesting curios --" shanghai surprise " not really overly engaging ( much like bomb film which it taken ) , but " zig zag " ( also said bomb ) actually fun little jazzy number . addition harrison lynne , other stars featured this cd include eric clapton , gary wright , elton john . but none them try hog spotlight ... all them graciously support their pal harrison he soars climbs cumulonimbus rare air pop perfection .	1
oklahoma must if you like good old broadway sound . i think it one rodgers hammerstein best works . this recording also held up classic broadway voice afred drake . songs all classics but they move slow after little while they all just start sounding same . main drawback this recording recording its self . since it made 1943 techonology lacking so it sounds like you listening old record . still it must all broadway fans	-1
i liked amelie soundtrack , but after i saw tremendous life performance yann thiersen amsterdam , i ran recordstore buy this record . yann thiersen without doubt musical genius , he played piano , alt-violin accordeon if these instruments part his body . one part , he even played piano one hand accordeon other . besides , he played some gitar prooved good singer well . other words , i've never seen so many talents united one person . track l'absente really stand out rest qu'en reste-t-il , solo performance alt-violin litterally blow you away . cd only two english spoken songs it , which not bad , but compared rest this cd bit awkward . if you like amelie , you'll like this album . if you happen able see life performance this man , go see it . my case , this concert one best i've seen many years ..	1
this band stunning ! they produced one those rare albums where everything its perfect place , everything relative , it need nothing extra nothing unneeded album . songs brilliant themselves but 100 times stronger when they together create brilliant whole , mantle . where you start agalloch ? first foremost atmosphere album . it most atmospheric album i ever heard . each track workd one create one huge progression throught this masterpeice . album cold , white desolate , solatary , isolated , beautiful atmosphere . it sounds like soundtrack walking through snow covered pine forests arctic or something like . there even samples wind bots trudging through snow . it one those records which throughout its duration paints crystal clear mental image ones head . this band gets compared opeth . not acurate all . its true they both lonely , epic atmospheres them , but where opeth warm claustrophobic , agalloch white , open , expansive , cold . there black metal vocals , there beautifully haunting clean vocals . there acoustic guitars , distorted guitars , all manner instruments which add effect , like traditional horns such . opeth never get particularily heavy . although they use some screaming , double pedals etc ... it always comes across perfectly ... expressive , opposed slamming heavy . there 4 instrumentals this album 5 " real " songs . they rerealy fall much short 10 minute mark . there variation dynamics this album use unuasual instruments make it even more varied . song structures brilliant , they not verse-chorus simple structure , they progressive evolve , like opeth . there howeve couple shorter , verse-chorus songs end te album , giving beautiul sense ending closure . this what i mean .. everything this album perfect ! lyrics brilliant too ... telling stories times . they black metal style lyrics .. worshipping nature , allbeit very intelligently subtly . there referances " oak " " pantheons " all adding natural imagery . i not narrow my recomendation anyone ! anybody who appreciate atmospheric , intelligent music should buy this listen it ove over again . it should listened whole , notas individual songs , given genuine time thought .... this not background music ! but whatever you put into listening this album you get out tenfold .	1

aussie twanger kasey chambers put out fine debut captain . this one , she occasionally allows more breathing room guitars dances closer rock end country-rock equation . her voice still same marvelous childlike instrument ( think julie miller ) but she ups songwriting tad this time out . there more tunes lodge themselves insistently than first effort . highlights : disc kicks off brassy title tune , declaration intent kasey snarls " iron bars big ole cars/won't run me out town/i'll d**ned if you're not my man/before sun goes down . " she follows up meek " not pretty enough " leaving you wonder which one " real " kasey . perhaps it both .. you get dose melancholy " bad day " ( chambers ' pal backer lucinda williams guests harmony ) but weeper " little bit lonesome " ( chambers channeling hank sr. ? ) " if i you " chambers again insists if her lovers don't " get " her , it their problem . ( " i'm only half what you see ... " ) " crossfire " edgy rocker kasey this time playing runaround romeo ( " if you don't hate me , you'll learn to/i thought i it clear start/i don't heart ... " ) perhaps strongest track visceral " ignorance " ( hidden after track 13 ) , chambers recoils world evils . ( " if you're not pissed off world/then you're just not paying attention " )lows : no real clunkers this time out , though " runaway train " sounds like knockoff title track . she didn't really bring anything new gram parsons cover either . ( " still feeling blue " )bottom line : if you like alt country or julie miller , this highly recommended . if you love traditional country ( loretta lynn , george jones , johnny cash ) you're looking something new " sounds old " , you'd well advised give this one listen	-1

when i first got this , i didn't like it near good happy trails , so i didn't play it much . once i really started paying attention , i couldn't quit listening . this brilliant debut now one my very favorites out large collection . there depth maturity this album alot better known 60 acts lacked . this album truley gets better each listen . sure , sound quality could stand remastering , but don't let get way . there so much atmosphere this music . it transports you like great music should . yea , there better lead vocalists out there , but there nothing bad this record . song quality top notch . pride man more relevant today than when it recorded . i've heard several versions this song , but quicksilver always my favorite . dino song puts smile my face everytime i hear it . gold silver awesome ! real gem . light your windows might just pass ballad someone else , but there depth atmosphere here only repeated listenings bring surface . it too long sort 50 feel , without sounding like nostaliga . fool : this masterpiece ! i still get shivers up my spine every listen . i just wish it longer . this song influential alot other groups , more so europe than here . i wish i could put into words just how much better this album gets every play ! i alot 60 albums , but there something subtle here many quicksilver contemporaries lack . it steal low price it sells . i think i'll listen it again right now . get it ! it one best	1

this album came out around my freshmen year college so i exposed it before she don't use jelly song took off . it took me while get into it , but once i gave album chance it struck me how different album how talented musicians . this came out grunge 90 i can't really think anyone doing anything this psychedelic or weird time . i mean no one writes songs moths incubators , or zebras running into space ships . it complete weirdness over catchiest melodies music . also , layers upon layers guitar sound towards end moth incubator just blows me away every time . over ten years later it doesn't surprise me one bit lips come out brilliant studio albums , incredible zaireeka experiment . few posess their level imagination or talent . i would also say this album isn't everyone , but then again most ground breaking albums aren't	1
finally , after four years ( since his 1998 work " cosas del amor " ) , enrique iglesias back " quiz�s " , all-spanish album , it worth wait . " quiz�s " great album variety songs them ; ballads he known ( tres palabras , para qu� la vida , mentiroso , etc . ) more latin pop based ( la chica de ayer , mamacita ) , " quiz�s " variety good songs . also included cd song seems blend smoothly ballad latin pop back ballad , " pienso en t� " , which great song . first single , " mentiroso " also offered marachi version , " no apagues la luz " , which his 2001 english album , " escape " . also included this bonus edition dvd which gives us good , but bit too quick , biography enrique , four music videos ( one each his first three spanish albums , his hit bailamos ) . not bad , considering most places , two discs sold less than " $ " together . even if enrique can't keep his english career going , his spanish one looks bright ever	1

one worst mos album i ever purchased . picked it up virgin store mistake , thought it aussy import version ( same cover design last year but no gold color ) but turns out , it us version . tracks less , selection poor , mixing mediocre . my initial investment went straight down drain . it seems every mos album targeted towards u.s. market always worse than uk ones . if 3 disc set uk version annual 2004 bad some reviewers said , then this one total trash worthy , other words , worst worst . i am going put it ebay hope i'll get some money back . i am not even going make mp3 copy it , it bad . if you take your hard earned money seriously , don't spend it this album . or buy it your own risk	-1
during extended avalanche grunge rap 90 , this cd offered refuge those who craved great pop music melody , harmony , lyrics substance . aimee mann " whatever " truly remarkable cd featuring 13 tracks sonic gold ! my opinion , amiee mann spent 80 climbing this very high point . her work "' til tuesday " managed improve each release . 80 outstanding decade pop rock , but " new wave " formula often used ( exploited early ' til tuesday ) tossed aside aimee truly shine . 90 may huge train wreck music industry , but aimee mann shining brighter than ever ! one cannot review this cd without mentioning production jon brion ( aimee ' til tuesday band mate ) . nothing short amazing ! i purchased this cd very day it released back early 90 . it since become timeless work " audio art " , one few truly great albums era . -j	1
i'm stunned after years listening fred neil contemporaries ( bob dylan , tim buckley , hoyt axton , etc . ) i never once heard his name or music mentioned other players folk era mid sixties greenwich village . i guess stands testament just how obscure fred neil ; term " fringe artist " really doesn't apply . liner notes this remastered edition his third album confirm neil made music himself didn't care business side music . like many others , i introduced music fred neil through sopranos show which used " dolphins " great effect during scene where christopher relapsed used heroin . my ears perked up i said out loud " who ? " i ran straight my hoyt axton discs started fumbling around thinking it him , but not finding song question . ( i later read axton largely influenced neil ; two certainly similar vocal styles . ) i tracked this disc down purchased it primarily " dolphins " , which incredible song . lyrics music combine capture such wistful sentiment , it become one my favorite songs . tim buckley covered this song also , although i haven't yet heard his version . i surprised quality rest music this cd . fred neil such great voice , obvious appreciation blues . i hadn't realized he songwriter who wrote " everybody talkin '" , later huge hit harry nilsson " midnight cowboy " soundtrack . liner notes explain neil refused cut song movie soundtrack , nilsson instead , further proof neil disregard fame or exposure . neil version plaintive direct i think i prefer it nilsson version i've hearing all these years . i interested read liner notes neil experience working doors ' producer paul rothchild what turned out complete clash personalities . producer this album took opposite approach rothchild , who tried handle neil ( which backfired ) , decided let him some friends greenwich village sit circle play their guitars until songs included album took shape into finished takes . whole disc informal feel , but mood captured hits spot every time i listen this . i would recommend this disc any fan singer/songwriters early seventies . this album confessional personal style similar artists follow neil . i would say fred neil probably one most overlooked sngwriters his generation , although i think he intended things way . however , this album needs heard , it really good	1

when i first got this album , way back 2002 , i wasn't crazy it . composer-wise , it didn't focus bright young things -- guettel et al . -- like audra previous efforts . period productions seemed get way this singer full spontaneity . but i heard it again this morning ( summer 2005 , or year our harold 100 ) it knocked me out !! what great songs , what wonderful treatments , ted sperling , don sebesky , others , above all what great singer ! perfect cure loss faith humankind , or least singer-kind . thank you audra . you definitely best	1

this perhaps most satisfying cd purchase i've made , bar none . if seems excessive , well , o.k. , it . but , this disc phenomenal , lover latin-american classical music , its must . ballet uirapuru cemented my view villa-lobos one most phenomenal orchestrators . uirapuru dark , mystical score tells story enchanted rainforest bird who turns into man , who falls love madien , but then gets shot angry old flute-playing man bow who upset because some hunters beat him up because he wierded them out . well , story may somewhat silly , but music unsettlingly powerful , glittering orchestration masterfully highlighted mata superb venezuelan players . chavez horse-power suite fascinating much more visceral way , mix neo-classical wit chugging latin rhythms . closing movement , ' el tropico ' , far surpasses pat benatar album same name , weaves intricate bach-ian counterpoint into darkly sentimental yet energizing tango . final selection , far most well known , ginastera popular estancia ballet suite . those who don't know piece , prepared blistering 6/8 rhythms exhilirating syncopations ( mainstay ginastera works ) . performances phenomenal , totally committed . dorian ( who put out number excellent cd surveying important latin-american repertoire ) provides top-shelf sound , usual . o.k. , so maybe it not best cd ever , but it close	1

great thing miles davis his trumpet playing so transcendent . he probably only jazz player whose albums frequently appear top 100 rock lists . i fail see how anyone could not take lilting sentiments ' porgy bess ' heart no matter what your musical tastes . ' buzzard song ' opens album grooving bass line paul chambers , cleverly imitated tuba follows suit ( how many albums you heard grooving tuba ? ) . then lyrical note changes ' bess , you my woman ' , before one highlights album , ' gone ' . this something departure gershwin opera itself , but backing players relish opportunity some pure jazz playing , topped off jones ramshakle drum playing . power ' summertime ' much its basic composition , which once both strong tender lends itself so many interpretations . this version musical backing acts counter davis elegant soloing . ' oh bess , where my bess ' proves most uplifting these tracks while ' prayer ( oh doctor jesus )' contains character-filled contributions all players building monumental crescendo . ' fisherman .... ' begins evocative alto flute danny banks , floating above slight air menance backing arrangement . straining lament ' my man gone now ' followed great toe-tapping swing arrangement ' it ain't necessarily so ' . gil evans arrangements much colour davis trumpet playing ' here comes de honey man ' . final highlight ' there boat leaving soon new york ' sounds unstoppable effusive , clear joy all involved . each individual player becomes miles davis equal this explosive finale . again i mention universal appeal miles davis work , whether indulging simple , lazy melody or bringing subtle nuances fore , his playing wonderfully haunting	1

i've mostly into ultra . trance series , but eventually moved away it when i started hearing songs so ' ghetto ' they couldn't possibly categorized trance first place , let alone wind up album who main sales pitch trance music . same thing happened ultra . dance series .... some strange reason more trance tracks appeared this album , which probably means dj compile these selections don't really know what they're doing . typically ultra series collections , you don't see really good dj compiling stuff ( like oakenfold/van buuren/tiesto ) . instead we get wannabe disc jockeys like riddler , vic latino , johnny vicious , etc ... seem all want get mad props/recognition , process striving fame , they lose thier credibility intermixing generes/going off tangent music album that supposed feature only one genere music . ultra . dance 06 i cite 3 or 4 different generes music this album touches . those like dance but not hip-hop/rb , they put up it , because these " amazing " dj felt those songs playlist . but when looking new compilations come these ' big time ' dj , including louie devito ( who compilations i gave up least 2 years ago ) , trend i've noticed how they this magic ability select songs just sound real bad . example , ' out touch ' ( disc 1 ) sounds like it compiled garage using 386 compiled twice over using mp3 encoding . seriously , some these songs cannot played loud high end system because they sound like trash . but if you people keep buying into it , then you support garbage . despite all this bashing , there few good songs this album . but i've basically enough ultra series . i would say if you like this album , you would like ' trip house ' series albums better	-1

someone said fantasia cd cover " hot mess . " actually , there nothing wrong cd cover ; it music itself that really hot mess . i so excited fantasia 2nd album now i'm just exteremly disappointed . fantasia supposed step up her game , not step down . you amy winehouse joss stone using leftover music previous decades , hailed great soul singers . yet if amy joss told make contemporary rb album , first thing they would get neptunes , timbaland , swizz beats . fantasia , who could blow amy/joss rest their ilk out water , comes out this tired album . i nothing against missy elliot , but she swizz beats very bad job producing fantasia album . how you going voice like fantasia come out this souless , immature , flavorless bubblegum noise ? it obvious fantasia wants pop mainstream , but it working against her . rb sound she " free yourself " can't find this new cd all . what you get some watered down rb music polluted loud repetitive club beats pop overtones . everything sounds like what already radio , there no potential classics , nothing would played quiet storm . it sounds " modern " it heavy style , but that it . other words , it forgetable . best song this cd " 2 weeks notice . " i actually don't like song , but it sounds better than other ones . i'm not feeling this all i'm upset . fantasia needs go back studio right away some different producers songwriters come up smooth rb sound . she needs remember where real fanbase . if mainstream doesn't like it , that too bad . sorry , but i'm skipping this	-1

i'll start saying i love jim steinman songwriter , almost everything he touches becomes gold . his previous work this one , ' bat out hell ' meat loaf recording vocals , masterpiece . said , let go jim steinman singer . i believe he great , but that my personal opinion . he may not able hit some notes meat loaf could , but his voice not much different range , it may lean more towards bruce springsteen sound , but it still grand none less . most songs here covered later meat loaf albums , some may sound better meat , but jim give each song his own particular style , which times beats even what meat loaf could manage . song ' rock roll dreams come through ' which hit meat loaf ' 93 , i feel steinman better job . i prefered his arrangement one ' bat ii ' , but again , just me . anyway it goes , i feel this crucial part rock history , if you're collector meat loaf albums , this must .	1
i came richard hawley his lowedges album , which i thought terrific . so while i am not able remark arc his solo career his first record , i think this record step down lowedges . don't get me wrong -- this record good -- very distinctive filled seductive murmurings ( both vocal guitar ) which hawley known . i can't help feeling , however , there somewhat disconnect music words . melodies still beautiful but lyrics more opaque than those lowedges , therefore i find songs less compelling . here , more than his earlier record , hawley repeats various lyric phrases ( " oh tonight , " " here my arms " ) , effect becomes hypnotic but not especially transporting or meaningful . two standouts me " darling wait me , " where lyrics come into focus music perfectly conveys wistfulness longing , " born under bad sign , " wonderfully relaxed tune , despite contradictorily themed , ominous lyrics . i've only it couple weeks , but i don't think this going get played much lowedges .	-1
500 years now , historians look back tumultuous 20th century ask , " yeah , but they accomplish anything ?

" grand funk remasters " series : first all , what took so freakin ' long release these records this format ? why we listen crappy sounding cds this day age ? nathan ( william snape ) says " full monty " during one his dad ( robert carlyle ) clumsy dance rehearsals --" crap ! " even beatles taking their own sweet time producing quality cds their catalog ! ( " capital albums vol . 1 " ) oh well , better late than never , i guess ! i just one last thing say record companies , et al involved concerning this faux pas ; guess which finger i'm holding up!there world difference sound these cds sterile sounding earlier digital releases same material ; fact alone justifies buying remasters . however , bonus music these cds makes them must-buy anyone who likes grand funk . " pluribus funk " : vintage grand funk railroad sound ! this last gfr record produced terry knight engineered ken hamann . i like gfr music released after this period , but plain fact matter this true sound group . it sound made them more than footnote rock history . again , i love grand funk sound after this phase , but they would never again able equal intensity band original mega-noise-nova-heaviness ! i hear heavy metal . i hear punk rock . i hear influence . think i'm exaggerating ? don't forget frank zappa liked them ! liner notes jazz trumpet player tim hagans ' cd , " animation-imagination , " he states he " dug " grand funk . addition , his written thank you section cd specifically calls out names , mark farner , mel schacher , don brewer ! ( note : craig frost not mentioned . ) don brewer says liner notes knight wasn't " great " producer " antiquated " " simple " approach recording gfr . say what ? greatness grand funk didn't anything " sophistication !

please note this re-issue earlier double cd similar title but different packaging . rocking berries , when they chose , brilliant pop group . they could also sing great comic songs . their problem their fans not appreciate this mix . so maybe group would more success if they left comedy barron knights , specialists kind music . they one other problem - they didn't write their own material so all their hits ( misses ) covers . group built up huge reputation live act secured contract decca . they recorded two singles decca , neither which charted britain although one ( wah wah wah woo ) well germany , where they also known great live performers . decca dropped them but they soon got contract piccadilly it their piccadilly recordings make up this compilation . they began minor hit - cover i didn't mean hurt you ( shirelles ) spent just one week uk charts , 43 . it might much bigger hit but extraordinary thing happened - their second single rush-released almost immediately . tokens , successfully american group , made little impact britain ( one minor hit - lion sleeps tonight - which lost out cover karl denver ) but release he town , which would surely big uk hit them , but rocking berries heard their demo recorded their own cover , which made top three . tokens , they never british hit , all their best songs hits via british cover versions . group seemed set up when they initially given funny how love , song written two members british group , ivy league . rocking berries recorded brilliant version would huge hit . unfortunately them , ivy league decided release their own version single so , piccadilly , subsidiary pye ( ivy league label ) , rocking berries not allowed release their version single but it included here . they minor hit what world come over you ( cover dovells song ) , then scored their second last big uk hit poor man son ( cover reflections song ) made top five . this followed tokens cover ( you're my girl ) but it only minor hit , sales hampered simultaneous release four-track ep . it this point their comedy material started alienate their younger fans only one more minor hit followed - water over my head ( cover eddie hodges song ) . several other singles all missed charts but it didn't seem bother group while - they very busy variety act didn't need hits . this comprehensive collection contains all their hits failed singles , b-sides , ep lp tracks . most music serious , their comedy mostly limited live shows , but examples their lighter side evident tracks such harvest love ( song you would expect hear wurzels or barron knights ) , when i'm cleaning windows ( cover george formby classic ) two children songs ( laughing policeman , i know old lady )	1
20 40 seconds brilliance followed long painful yearning . these not songs , but rather multiple 20 second jingles joined together serve movie , but not listener . you can't even call them medley . silvestri amazing , but soundtrack leaves you yearning more . twenty second blurb not enough whole song . multiply this accross entire cd what you nothing worth listening .	-1

released 1970 , this debut album british band egg extremely complex progressive rock dominated some incredible hammond organ work . i guess it worth noting although this keyboard-led trio considered part " canterbury ' scene , music sounds nothing like caravan or hatfield north ( although canterbury sense humor present ) . rather , music egg combines significant proportion avant-garde tendencies classical some dissonant passages . general though , over-the-top technical excess order day i absolutely love i t.t he musicians this album include keyboardist extraordinaire dave stewart ( hammond organ , acoustic piano , mellotron , tone generator - it crude synthesizer ); mont campbell ( vocals , bass guitar ); clive brooks ( drums ) . all these guys simply phenomenal musicians individual ensemble playing simply out this world . respect bass player , mont campbell not simply follow left hand piano part but thoroughly contrapuntal , which makes egg composition very interesting . although mont vocal abilities not great sound tiny bit dated times , vocals not big part egg sound not detract anything all . tracks album range length 0'09 " experimental track bulb excellent 25+ minute multi-movement symphony no . 2 . general , music album mixes experimental passages some very nice adaptations classical pieces ( j.s. bach toccata fugue d-minor grieg hall mountain king ) , incredible jamming , quirky proggy tracks vocals ( while growing my hair , i absorbed , song mcgillicudie pusillanimous ) . large part though , tracks mostly instrumental dominated dave incredible hammond organ playing . although this album simply amazing very enjoyable , there moments when avant-garde tendencies get mildly irritating , but little affect overall listening experience . this becomes apparent " they laughed when i sat down piano " , which features very nice classical piano piece countered some abrasive noises tone generator - it actually kind funny really . there also tone generator " freak-out " symphony no . 2 during blane movement gets little nerve-wracking . odd time signatures abound meters such 5/8 , 7/4 , 9/4 , 9/8 , 13/8 used frequent meter shifts . chord structures also pretty exotic there some very unusual root movements . this remastered version eclectic discs very good features ton liner notes restored cover art pictures band . sound quality also excellent . one features this version album pretty cool addition previously unreleased fourth movement symphony no . 2 . additional tracks include seven jolly good time , which celebrates jolly delights ( or horrors , depending your perspective ) playing 7/4 , " you all princes " ( which ends abruptly ) . both tracks released singles 1969 pretty good . there tiny bits psychedelic influences two tracks . all all , this excellent stuff highly recommended superb follow up album polite force ( 1971 )	1
during time period this album ( 1970 - 1972 ) leon russell top rock concert act world . back day when most rock groups four or five members , leon russell hit road no less than ten top line performers , including derek dominos bassist carl radle , rev . patrick henderson black grass . leon russell shelter , you get studio recording captures much leon concert feel - but where you understand words , instruments balanced well . i don't remember if personnel same , but feel right there ! starting " thee i sing , " through end album you'll looking flat peice ground so you dance . piano work awesome , combining leon black gospel style ( he also played some andrae crouch albums ) bit blues , honky country . if you're musician , you'll want this album " utility licks " turn arounds gold nuggets playing leon throws out there . this album one i learned play pianq , listening it over over picking it out bit bit . all all , it great selection genre music timeless make you feel good - you definitely won't get inferiority complex you sing leon ! it feeling rather than velvety smooth david gates ( leon also played him , sixties , prior bread ) voice . get it	1

most reviews i read this disc seem pretty pleased both performance recording . other hand i am just slightly influenced some thoughtful comment i seen expresses few reservations regarding balance -- me reviews ' useful ' if they show independent judgment , not if they support my preconceptions which quite strong enough not need reinforcing . what this account definitely vivid . orchestral detail very clear , but if i ask myself whether this quite how planets sounds concert hall , then i'm not so sure . i like it this way , but this not piece where i am hard please way i am performances viennese classics or ravel or sibelius or elgar or walton . general this very effective reading planets . tempi sound right me , no doubt because they much what i am used , playing orchestral discipline superb . this only disc planets i own or plan own because it not work i'm fussy , but connoisseurs may want consider whether effectiveness slightly overmanipulated recording technicians	1
rob swift something elder statesmen , regards art turntablisim , one original founders " x-ecutioners " turntable collective , ( which he since parted ways ) . but seeing rob generally one always sporadically releasing solo albums , always looked push boundaries turntable dynamics , reluctant solely rely hip-hop his expression music , instead regularly incorporated complex arrangements : soul , funk , illbient , electronica , seamlessly woven into his mixes , this hasn't too much problem . here , he looks stretch things even further , building album reflection not only devastation 9/11 attacks , but subsequent decision go war iraq , bring into some context mood assess current climate america . but obviously this isn't singer/songwriter protest album , , there already many rap albums since , touched upon these issues . so you'd impressed hear this turntable album , brings these views situations some context . you'd ( quite rightly ) figure , you'd pretty mad want try build album collates such important topical subject matter into dj turntable album , but then this ' rob swift ' we're referring what he devise multimedia album sorts visual side handled accompanying dvd , regular cd , providing music/commentary side things . it album clearly anti-bush , both president his party , coming under intense scrutiny throughout album . but instead traditional ' finger-pointing ' exercise ( although there moments ) , it more album takes fragments all over place uses them , carefully build up picture , documenting elements 9/11 attacks , retaliation military attacks iraq , what repercussions this means . this primarily album ' war ' . so rob pieced together this album , using media footage , dialogue , press statements , presidential addresses , political commentary , sampling , tracks lyrics under rob editing , express terrorist climate , gun-ho posturing , anti-war sentiments . so you rob cleverly taking george bush addressing american , his announcement american taking military action , cleverly manipulated via rob swifts deft cutting scratching , focusing his reasons retaliation , declaration war against iraq . classic rap tracks , taken completely rebuilt reinterpreted work statements intent war ( ' eric rakim ' , just one example ) . instrumental pieces rob reigning back over top turntable dynamics working more like stream-of-consciousness tracks kinetic looping conjuring up imagery post 9/11 nation , still coming terms attacks , change peoples perceptions . even going so far imply america become more fearful nation because attacks . political commentary dropped throughout album , impressive thing i've always found rob swift , his doesn't always feel need display his technical ability , but seems far more keen create moods , artful juxtapositions virtuosic cutting which bounce ideas around . hip-hop tracks obviously present , but various rappers/vocalists brought feature multitude tracks . again , themes here : retalition/media coverage/inaccuracies war/spin pr/hostile reactions/distrust/confusion remains progressive thoroughly engaging ( even if you don't necessarily agree , statements ) . but what surprise not all these tracks purely backed hip-hop production/arrangements , instead , it just likely feature elements rob own musical influences so there moments when funk soul recordings even piano , provide softer edge vocal dynamics , subtle cutting scratching mixing things up wonderfully . variety music really works this records favour , because it tends make record more cerebral tone , take higher ground than , mere aggressive sloganerring ( think more " dj spooky " than " x-ecutioners " ) . amongst there more agitated social political theories , all delivered provocative confident directness . interspersed amongst musical tracks snippets ' reportage ' .... features , news events , social commentaries highlight growing disparity social classes , passages sampled news dialogue that'll make you think , or very least pay attention whats highlighted . it never presented patronising manner , but actually more like showing much we'd all like believe one day , people become empowered , class divide go smaller . america still great many issues work through , before any sort universal consciousness or collective understanding possibly attained . if your expecting mix album , go alongside rob swifts previous work , i'm afraid say you won't find it here . it surprising rob taken so long make his own statements or stances evident record , especially it so long after much what happen very well documented . but then i feel this more observation , rather than providing any clear insight into world post-9/11 . sometimes it more preferable information presented you , way individual make up their own minds or conclusions , i think that whats happened here . because it doesn't truly clarify anything other than when regards politics , media , government repressive bureaucracies , we shouldn't so willing accept what his presented us . it clear rob stance one obviously ' anti-war ' , but he declines impress upon listener see ( hear ?? ) his way thinking , instead he more like exercising his right ' freedom speech/expression ' , this isn't really album become engrossed it technical trickery , but arguably work artist , feels his unparallelled technical ability turntables , needed confined just knocking out stunning mix album . this more certainly rob swifts most mature focused work , even though it not something bump club , scope it knocked me back little , most certainly left impression . not only innovative ( reasonably informative ) , but daring take art turntablism , push it into completely new direction , confrontational daring question america governments reasons military action , just might peoples asking questions or looking more closely governments actions . although you might not necessarily agree album , but it doesn't mean this shouldn't heard , even hear just how far turntablism come since it early days	1

production-wise this album get somewhat boring few tracks around halfway through , but cuts like " keep ya head up " " i get around " more than make up weaker points . " last wordz " features ice cube ice probably my favorite track . it shows 3 best ever it west coast trading mics easily over nice beat . you'll notice lot scratching here provide hooks production sounds more like it new york , but just shows pac versatility . 4.5 star album because weak tracks , but i'll round up give it 5 . definitely buy this well all pac other cds before death row " all eyez me "	1

after fully listening this cd well over year i decided finally put my thoughts into writing . this mix turning into one most inventive cd releases since digweed sydney global underground release disc 1 . over five years ago digweed dropping tribal percussion beats like hong kong trash , elements , shape shifter ... molding tunes together where you would literally think yourself " what hell going here ! this superb .. " lisle taken things same level this mix . this mix meant truly " listened " not just put generic thumping prog . he drops breaky techy sounding overlays all while keeping your head adrift excellent track selections . certain cd never get old , others you stop listening after multiple rotations . dance music changes so often disc created 3 years ago often considered dinosaur . after careful attention this cd , i think 5 years now , this cd still library . listen carefully you find small details mix smile . nice work jonathan .. nice work	1
1999 nominations quot ; grammyquot ; awards compacy disc extremely dissapointing . varaity different types music made me dislike it . there version backstreet boys quot;backstreet backquot ; i've never heard before . also they opera (?) music andrea bocelli . i think it great he nomination , same dixie chicks . but country opera aren't kind music deserve place compact disc ages 10-15 majority people buy it . i'd say pop , rock , alternative , rap main choices music pre-teens choose . if you like opera , country , pop , soft rock , this album you . but if your around 12 13 i would not recommend this , so save your money go buy something else	-1

these recordings long some most difficult find mississippi john hurt catalogue . this ironic they among finest recordings hurt ever made . recorded during two marathon recording sessions summer 1963 , this second batch material hurt recorded after his rediscovery . first batch recorded april same year . i can't say enough these library congress recordings or mississippi john hurt , general . these sessions , particular , warmth intimacy them i really enjoy . hurt plays many these cuts positioning his guitar strings tuned down one or two steps . this really brings out warmth his voice . consider , example , his rendition " corrina corrina " . this may lowest i've ever heard him sing . his voice guitar so up close they positively tickle your ear . there would such void recorded blues music , without lovely contributions mississippi john hurt . my money , no other blues singer sings plays such gentleness , grace , beauty . he truly category all his own , which why many people past argued hurt not blues singer all , but songster . we so lucky hurt discovered recorded , first ' 28 then later during blues revival 60s . it really makes you wonder all those blues singers never recorded died unnoticed . time i born , mississippi john hurt already passed . i'm really glad his music lives	1

nearly 25 years chanticleer performed large wide variety music , gregorian chant most modern fare . its seamless blend 12 male voices , ranging counter-tenor bass , ensemble earned international renown " orchestra voices " . chanticleer founded 1978 tenor louis botto , named after ' clear-singing ' rooster chaucer ' canterbury tales ' . this cd offers wide variety choral gems , some well-known ; some traditional ; some french , german ; most english . but all them performed great skill well exquisite tone quality . dawn upshaw added plus this disc . just commenting few them captured my interest : " christmas round " / " today virgin " . sir john tavener joined russian orthodox church 1977 which tremendous impact his compositions . brief text ' christmas round ' orthodox liturgy christmas day . ' today virgin ' strophic setting text mother thekla , orthodox nun , who provided him libretti several his major works . typical russian orthodox style , drone employed bass , upper voices move parallel fifths octaves .

mm food , what i say this album which not said already , well not much but what i say this one my favourate albums , first time i heard it i thought it just good but after repeated listens i began hear intricisies dooms rhymes , understanding slang ( please note coming england some american slang lost us)and metaphors . doom such accomplished emcee , first time i heard him venomous villain , not great album but his skill left me awe i just seek out rest his material , currently i own most his albums including operation doomsday which dare i say my opinion not good this album . majority album produced doom himself , one track produced count base , pns madlib also track each , every song my opinion great beef rapp kookies . production varied yet i think most people need time get used it i don't know sure but people i've played it told me they needed time let it grow them , but opinions positive . overall this outstanding album varied production doom never sounded better , only thing i not like tracks 6-9 which all skits which annoying since it all lumped together it breaks up flow album but this far one dooms more consistent efforts worthy successor operation doomsday	1

good 20 years through many eras music continuing his tenth release " slow time " , patrick o'hearn retains amazing quality defined way i view new age music ever since hearing ancient dreams when i just toddler . newest release appropriately entitled " slow time " just title suggests , very slow but gorgeous album home run arguably my favorite new age maestro last decade half . album without doubt major departure even his more medieval sounding works followed " indigo " many years ago . it perhaps greatest departure his trademark sound since changes took place el dorado indigo . here o'hearn rhythms absent six eight tracks here . album places reminds me almost steve roach " magnificent void " nearly decade ago it eerie sounds space atmospheres . those who've embraced " ancient dreams " " beautiful world " " so flows current " not immediately thrilled this newest outing but me , it new chapter arc music pat released last 20 years . " music three vibraphones " eight-minute experimental track nothing but vibraphone/marimba instrument delivering beautiful if somewhat repetitive melody metallic tones vibraphone . i've played something similar oddly enough when playing vibraphone . track my opinion greatest departure any his songs past . it followed up title track which more akin what i'd hear jonn serrie or steve roach . " slow time " haunting melody what me sound lot like dripping water cricket sound effects create really dark but beautiful somber melody . this track oddly enough reminds me images swimming deep ocean light provided deep sea fish using their own lights illuminate scene . " let move " experimental track uses mostly electronic effects create dark psychedelic but peaceful atmosphere track reminds me electronic experimental tracks early 1970s like " cosmic kitchen " roger powell . " i could live here " goes into more familiar o'hearn territory strange water like ambient background effects tribal sound dominates track . effects beautiful merge into fifth track entitled " where we once stood " which moody melancholy track reminds me somewhat " lone man " decade earlier . " welcome sight " closest one gets familiar o'hearn territory maracas-like instrument providing percussion bits pieces medieval sounds previous releases well beautiful echoing pianos . " slow time " yet again wonderful outing one greatest new age maestros new age field . it may not kind album changed world way " indigo " or " so flows current " me but it still must-have . who knows what o'hearn cook up next . highly recommended .	1
i must admit i never boyzone fan quite fankly i found ronan solo efforts rather dull , so when friend lent me copy boyzone member stephen gately debut solo cd i rather skeptical . i pleasantly surprised . this cd filled wonderful pop sounds stephen sweet singing voice used full effect here . several tracks cowritten stephen himself , lyrics basically dealing his coming-out . wonderful cd - i throughly recommend it	-1
sepultura second full length release similar their breakthrough album , " beneath remains , " lot ways , so i'm surprised this c.d. ( " schizophrenia " ) didn't get more attention . like " beneath remains , " " schizophrenia " death/thrash metal album full brim blindingly fast , pile driving riffs , scorching solos , pounding drums , max violent , death metal barks . plus , even though it sounds rather rough , it not quite great or groundbreaking sepultura third or fourth albums , this album actually quite great . tracks three four , " wall " " escape void , " good examples this album insane guitar drum work . next , " inquisition symphony " good centerpiece album , because it instrumental . it also tour-de-force guitarist andreaas kisser , flattening riffs , searing solos , even acoustic guitars . other highlights include " past comes storms " ( which catchy , chugging , pounding riffs ) , " septic schizo , " " abyss " ( which acoustic guitar interlude ) , " r.i.p. ( rest pain ) . " finally , like remastered version " beneath remains , " if you buy reissue " schizophrenia " ( which i strongly recommend you improved sound quality ) , you get two bonus tracks : " rough mixes " " septic schizo " " wall . " these remixes actually not remixes all , they're instrumentals . they're exact same original song , only without vocals . bottom line , this should sepultura breakout album , but since it not ( it not considered one best thrash albums all time ) , " schizophrenia " isn't absolute must every metal collection . but , because it foreshadowed greatness come sepultura later works , " schizophrenia " essential every sepultura/max cavalera collection	1
i'm not dissin ' this girl when i call her cherry ' cause that what her friends call her , i think . anyway , this xlnt cd cherry . far away my fave song quot ; move me . quot ; diversity styles this , throughout , songs this cd extraordinary . but this one song so good . classical elements rap hard imagine but cherry it beautifully . rest cd quite good- but this one song makes cd must . good luck cherry . she got it	1

i just browsing saw only 5 people rated this album , which really not band or this album justice . album allot older than ' 97 cd release , late 80s i guess , vinyl era . this album success europe , " where i go wrong " perhaps their second most commercially successful song , " red red whine " ( not this one ) number one . non reggae listener this great entry album . it basically takes reggae goes pop it , spinning some sweet melodies process . however , what makes ub40 so unique they made some more accessable mainstreamed reggae without it sounding fabricated . they also made serious " true " reggae , their labor love series , i feel this comes through their pop oriented work . part thanks nuanced melancholy voice one their lead vocals , ub40 made many lasting song their long career , this album probably best place get started them	1

straight story film i really like major reason this music . i can't think movie i've seen which musical score this gripping , especially song 3 , which i think called laurens walking . after hearing what angelo badalamenti twin peaks , well , makes me aware i'm hands genius . though david lynch his editors ( mary sweeney , i think , key one ) didn't create any this music angelo ( least , i don't think ) , they accentuate it so immensely using it such beautiful ways images film it seems they should almost get small songwriting credit well . i didn't think watching 79-year old man riding tractor iowa wisconsin could feel so haunting , endearing sometimes spooky .	-1

yeah , we know miles went through many phases stages , but this where i started miles after i initially heard " sketches spain " , then i went " round midnight " coltrane , then backwards mile charlie parker days , then i went forward " live blackhawk " , then " kind blue " . whew . that alot ground , but miles mercurial great everything he , never stopping very long smell particular group roses before moving next challenge . ' piece d'resistance ' here extended performance " i'll remember april " . huge , mind-opening performance !! arrangement-wise ( very uptempo native-american oriented ) , performance-wise , it just wonderful , i've listened it decades same wonder enjoyment . kenny clarke brushwork too much , davey schildkraut ( alto ) miles ( muted trumpet ) blow wonderful , inspired solos still fresh today ; but horace silver two piano solos steal show even his piano fills during magnificent percy heath ' walking bass ' section exceptional . worth entire cd !! don't miss this ! " tune up " " smooch " ( mingus ' amazing pianism double stops ) also great , but gem " four " . few times history jazz music so much wonderful stuff so little time than " four " . totally mesmerizing . i absolutely love miles ' solo , ultra hip clever horace silver piano solo , blakey wonderful rimshot groupings . wow ! afterthought : song " tune up " later received legendary extended wonderful performance sonny rollins one his own cds . mingus also displays more his piano work his solo piano cd " mingus plays piano " . buy all three enjoy overlap	1
this concert 1955 " must " anyone interested history jazz . this something time capsule - impromptu concert toronto individual winners jazz poll . no rehearsal - they just turned up played . this all " bebop " reeks late 40s new york : charlie parker dizzy gillespie playing mixture gillespie compositions ( salt peanuts ) standards such night tunisia perdito . rythm section bud powell , charles mingus max roach standard playing overall breathtaking . sound actually pretty good , considering this 50 year old tape recording . treasure	1

this 2nd album punk legends not universally acclaimed when it appeared 1979 . short intro poppy day ( lyrics poem john mccrae ) sets gothic tone join hands , extending boundaries banshees ' unique punk strain . here they prove slow , melodic songs equally effective evoking sense menace . playground twist classic early siouxsie , but it gets even better mother/oh mein papa , successful experiment where juxtaposed words lullaby medley create sinister feel eerie buildup music . other songs like regal zone placebo effect more reminiscent debut album , powerful guitar siouxsie piercing vocals . icon premature burial quite dark gothic probably served inspiration later goth bans like bauhaus . original album ended cacophonic bang lord prayer medley which includes phrases o claire de la lune/mon ami pierrot , chilling tomorrow belongs me ( movie cabaret ) sundry other sources . this re-release includes two new tracks , which classic love void far best . join hands more varied than their debut album scream , therefore worthy follow-up , perhaps one their more underrated works .	1

this cd 1985 most powerful new band i heard mid-80 . period i consider very dry real melody , voice twang without synths . even my favorites , dylan , petty , springsteen name few . place over production . this only really great lone justice release . short lived their originality , lone justice band disc one best soon titled , alt-country items around . los lobos'quot;by light moonquot ; runs close second but fact maria mckee so young ( 19 ) this band so raw real , just good concert . made them hopeful antithesis digital soundscape saturating radio time . i think this timeless	1
bowie loved this band . when their lack success almost broke them up , he came produced this album them . this 1972 masterpiece put them up there likes . rex ziggy stardust bearers musical movement loosely called glam rock . imagine glamed out rolling stones . they not goofy like slade or artsy like roxy music or bowie . they just right . like new york dolls , they trashy attitude . unlike dolls , they knew how play their instruments . bonus material great . demo version " one boys " out sight	1
career full vastly dissimilar masterpieces , small change one those handful waits albums markedly stands out rest . this only waits ' fourth album , continuing his evolution into ravaged-voiced , drunken nighhawk beat poet came into fruition his previous record , nighthawks diner . but this time around , waits merges this persona set truly moving , melodically rich diverse tunes . albums immediately following this one ( foreign affairs particular ) , waits ' character beginning show signs stagnation , empty role playing . but 1975 , this record , none these signs wear come through . what left completely unique compelling atmosphere , excellent songs compliment . ' tom traubert blues ' arguably greatest thing here , one waits ' most recognizable songs one his most moving lyrics , not mention phenomenal melody . elsewhere , all sides early waits spot , hilarious beat-rap poet , desolate drunken piano balladeer , sinister storyteller ; all them place here , arguably their pinnacle . if you interest early waits , small change or more accessible , gorgeous ' closing time ' places start . 1970 , waits also major innovator within rock roll genre ( he more famously 1980 ) , but efforts such this go slightly un-noticed due more familiar efforts such ' rain dogs ' . small change deserves listen anyone who digs tom waits .	1
reading lazy reviews always gets my blood pumping enough sit down what bill hicks night night out ; tell truth . rant minor not only funniest comedy album ever but it also most cathartic experience available purchase . bill continues represent , even 12 years after his death , something sadly lacking comedy these days brute honesty . bill hicks like soccer : most countries seem appreciate material except amercians . could because most americans don't like hear truth ? i always read reviews people complain bill " just ranting , it not funny " , etc . what makes bill material so absolutely hilarious he audacity himself . he true original who saw world through sunglasses no other human ever worn . why can't we laugh how f*cked up world through comedic medium ? why must we inundated soul-sucking , lifeless , company men like jeff foxworthy who continue dumb down homoginize comedy ? bill hicks always find new audience through generations , like lenny bruce before him , simply brave enough telling it like it ( ) . main difference hicks bruce , though , hicks funny beyond belief ! hicks wasn't afraid pour his heart out audience , showing us his sensitive side , his profound side any other side he . because this honesty , his true self shone through god it gloriously funny ! " rant " particular , he allows us laugh until we cry such when he goes off jay leno his doritos shilling ways . how could anyone not find rush limbaugh bit funny ?? good god , people , lighten up , open up your third eye ( bill recommended ) listen this album again . again . again . i fortunate enough see bill perform this very material before he died 1993 . my memories night always me i experienced one true visionaries original talents this world ever seen .	1

virgin black darkest band i've found whose music lyrics address spiritual crisis without mocking it . while lot metal sounds like heat killing , this band sounds like hour later , when we stop look dead all around us . if you've heard saviour machine , virgin black moves slower heavier direction . " opera de romanci " opens cello gregorian chant promising darkness come . " embrace " makes good it dose slow metal orchestration worthy film score . virgin black strikes great balance , alternating " funeral metal " orchestration . " walk without limbs " starts cool beat , like bachman turner overdrive " takin ' care business " . then it changes gears into industrial-rock sound unusual this band . " your beauty " finally puts rowan london operatic voice front . his voice exceptional lyrics pull listener into place where it always 4 a.m. , winter never quite yields spring . " drink midnight hymn " jumps out speakers dose speed metal shrieking akin mayhem . this cd following " elegant ... dying " , songs change speeds modes often . samantha escarbe plays guitar restraint , valuing songs over solos . " museum iscariot " three-part suite lot variety , less intensity than some tracks before after . " lamenting kiss " semi-industrial beat opening chant sounds like train siren losing strength distance . then london voice takes lead again . " poet tears porcelain " powerful finale - escarbe finally busts out some fierce guitar melodies . metal cuts off abruptly , leaving brief chanted melody end whole thing . image i get this album someone lying down stone altar dark , eyes open , waiting	1
star sailor satisfied my need some new tunes new releases coldplay radiohead it so well i nearly like them better . this album complaints sounding same throughout , but it strength . i loved every song . this album didn't leave my cd player few weeks end i singing out loud each every song . my favorites " silence easy , " " born again , "" some us , " " fidelity , " but heck they all so good i could include every one them . great album , polished crystal clear . if you like coldplay or radiohead you'll like these guys . however , band comparisons don't them justice . one my top 5 albums year	1

sonic youth one more influential revered bands last 20 years . they rightfully known godfathers indie rock . i think no other band consistently putting out quality music long sonic youth . some bands manage string together 2 or 3 good albums , but then tend fade into obscurity , break-up , or start suck . amazingly , sonic youth yet succumb any those fates . they occasional slump ( mid-to-late 90 ) , yet they still here- producing worthwhile , quality albums . my mind , their creative peak late 80's; when they put out amazing trilogy `evol ' , `sister ' , `daydream nation ' . i love this band own every single one their albums . said , `sister ' my favorite . `sister ' initially released sst records 1987 , my mind stands quintessential sonic youth release . there mythic , mystical undercurrent pulling listener thru this delicious album . it hard quantify explain . guitar interplay thurston lee something special- times beautifully melodic , dissonant , violent , loving , ethereal . these songs really speak me . this awesome work open `schizophrenia ' ( you really need hear this song live sometime ) . i like how both kim thurston share vocals this track- something they should more often , which they fact numerous times `sister ' . lyrically this one sonic youth finest efforts , which should no surprise anyone when they realize youth heavily into philip . dick time this album written . feelings insanity , isolation , loneliness , chaos , love pervade `sister'- these all themes which dick intimately familiar . number sonic youth best tracks appear this album . `stereo sanctity ' dissonant , delirious , wonderful . this followed reflective mysterious `pipeline/ kill time ' , which makes use lee poetic lyrics , rolling drums , incredible feedback control . after this amazing track comes `tuff gnarl ' , which ends devastating divinely dissonant guitar frenzy . maintaining momentum , next up `pacific coast highway ' , one kim gordon best tracks- she sounds genuinely scary outset , which serves perfect lead-in more guitar beauty . this stretch here- tracks 4 through 7 , marks one best i heard any album . `cotton crown ' follows `hot wire my heart ' ( which i could've without ) . `cotton crown ' closest thing sonic youth love song , but don't let deter you- i hate love songs . instrumental section middle this song thing beauty power . dissonant guitars never sounded so soothing ( exception my bloody valentine loveless ) . `white cross ' follows this gem , ending album rocking note . `master-dik ' actually ends this version `sister ' ( i don't think it original sst version ) . `master-dik ' very tongue-in-cheek sonic youth take hip hop , complete lots distorted guitars even kiss sample . if you only familiar recent sonic youth , you find yourself wishing they would rock out more , than you need this album . this probably youth most rocking album . guitar blistering throughout . all though it blistering , distorted , dissonant ; it highly soothing quite trance inducing times . guitar interplay here paved way amazing sonics exhibited their next album , undisputed masterpiece- `daydream nation ' . song writing `sister ' some their best- cosmically poetic mystically enchanting . this , conjunction otherworldly music make fascinating listen . if you like sonic youth , but yet get this album , you must so immediately . if you only familiar major label youth ( post-goo ) , then you must immediately get this incredible album . finally , if you curious sonic youth , but yet delve into their daunting catalogue , this might not best place start . `goo ' `daydream nation ' might better jumping off points . however , if you musically adventurous , guitarist , or fan interesting rock , you most likely love this wonderfully dissonant work . after many years , hundreds upon hundreds cd vinyl albums , `sister ' remains one my favorites .	1

i bought this few months ago listened it many times since then , so i think my opinion pretty " cooled off " or objective . but i guess doesn't matter anyways , because i still think just highly it when i first popped it . basically , if you tortoise fan , this no-brainer ( 3 cds ! dvd ! startlingly good price ! ) . it gives you really broad look their " earlier " sound , which put me off when i first listened some their older stuff 16 , but my taste developed , my appreciation grew point where i actually like this style more than their newest stuff(like standards , it all around you ) . some tracks definately more experimental , but you just appreciate them what they . tracks variety , i especially like " whitewater " " cobwebbed . " they kind melodic ambient ... you could compare them some aphex twin .... but they their own " cool " it . remixes also great . nobukazu takemura remix tnt really sweet ... way he manipulates droning windchimes end it give sound such depth space evokes epic withdrawn mood , where you just kind melt away . i think some ancient japanese ritual when i hear it , but that just me . i won't even begin describe unreal energy opener , " gamera . " then there dvd . some music videos kind weak my opinion , but others fantastic , kind funny bizarre . it rad see them play gamera live , when it new song mid-90s . all all , this great collection . i recently chance see them troubador la , which further solidified them my mind remarkable band . i wouldn't miss out this one	1

all three anthology albums outstanding . this second three . these songs middle their career . like anthology 1 , there many outtakes unfinished songs well . personally this my favorite era beatles music , so this my personal favorite three . real love opens cd finally finished after several years vault . its good hear beatles 2 songs after 26 years apart . there many songs note , i am simply going hit highlights . you've got hide your love away minor changes sounds very much like original , only difference again it unfinished not ending way we hear it cd . you also hear paul walking band through very early version yesterday . it so new before song he instructing john george what chord progression . lyrics finished . only difference we dont hear cellos violins they later used . there also very good version norweign wood catch your attention . it much more sitar than recording we know . taxman also note , again very much like original , third verse added harmony note . got get you into my life early stages not horns added later . i'm only sleeping played acoustic guitar its early stages well . strawberry fields shows progression song acoustic guitar finished project . evolution this song very interesting . day life its very early stages also it shows you how george martin able put song together stages . there also songs show beatles laughing during recording such your bird sing . i only hit highlights . any beatles collector needs buy this well other two anthology album	-1
i don't generally listen what described progressive/art rock , but i may change . dredg catch without arms one most enjoyable albums i own listen . every single song good . some better than others , but this one few records i know i really like every single song . they're all good different reasons . dredg combines strong music , beautiful singing , hard riffs all into formula that hard me resist . " ode sun " starts album well , high rising vocals cool instrumentation . it followed single " bug eyes " , which strong alternative rock song . " not simple " probably my favorite song catch without arms . it great chorus tune after second third refrains sucks me . it ends strangely , child singing chorus later song album what sounds like recording telephone conversation . next song , " zebraskin " , most unique . it not kind song i usually like but some reason it works . rest album folds out similar fashion . it all fairly different sounding , well sung , well performed , quality rock music . it not kind stuff that everyone , but i can't really ask more enjoyable album . i still yet find perfect artist , but if every record like this i'd extremely happy	1

next " indigo girls , " this remains my favorite cd amy emily . " three hits " elegiac " cedar tree , " emotional weight " rites passage " seemed greater than any their other records . much i liked dire straits ' original version " romeo juliet , " amy raw exuberance won me over their cover keeps . they also kept up their social barometer . pro-peace " galileo " ( harmonies jackson browne david crosby ) called nuclear disarmament during time when protest songs weren't particular norm . " jonas ezekiel " prays peace middle east ( funny how problem remains timely now it 1992 ) . there also line " let it me " rings out pure folk : " president no good idea who masses . well i'm one them among my friendstrying see beyond fences our own backyards . " political personal mesh throughout " rites passage . " " ghosts " beautiful love song cries tolerance . it probably ranks among my favorite ig songs . " chickenman " " airplane " also explore their southern roots ( i could sworn " chickenman " rem song first time i heard it ) . re-master " rites " first rate well . it brings out definition acoustic instruments . " romeo juliet " now explodes stereo . while i also admit , i really don't think live cuts add anything cd whole . i continue recommend " rites passage " pinnacle indigo girls ' career	-1
my admiration this lady grows album album ( or disc disc if you ) . she states notes , it not simply singler plus band but integration musicians , each excelling what he or she best . fact , playing individuals lends better , deeper , more satisfying sound . sound pure professionalism - no slurred words , chaotic drums , random bass chords or meandering searching over keys . arrangements themselves matched only voice which only described magnificent . i really liked choice songs . ms. sutton artistic niche reinterpreting works others - whether it once wordless melodies ( quot ; unsung heroesquot ;) , frank sinatra ( quot ;d ancing darkquot ;) or bill evans ( this work ) . each every venture work genius i mean true genius . ok , what stands out this one ? quot ; turn out lightsquot ; pure emotion , dripping sensuality . version quot ; autumn leavesquot ; its sonata-like movements just sensational . quot ; just you just mequot ; duet drummer ray brinker - tour de force . he major player quot ; old devil moon . quot ; quot ; you night musicquot ; mysterious , captivating work totally succeeds . i could go each every selection but suffice it say this one recording i almost order you purchase ... now ... soon possible .	1

purchasing this limited edition import cd comes my personal guarantee you transported back days when things so much easier because lines drawn more clearly those who enlightened those who not . it pity it took 35 years me discover this band ... * every * song transports you " era " when where we thought we going change world combining drugs music . few efforts late-1960s hold up close scrutiny because studio excesses molded music into rigid format . i promise ( excuse me : guarantee ) golden dawn fresh today it 1968 . dare i say their work seminal ? probably not because i am authority 1960s ; but , there something here transcends decades fills heart joy brain marvelous visions	1
tony desare not frank sinatra knock off like some current crop 20 30 something male crooners . he original , he talented , marvelous crystal clear voice . not only he sing he also plays cool jazz piano . this album not depend standards sell it singer , there only two standards cd he sings , " just time " " this could start something big " , which like title last song , it . mr desare talent besides singing playing , he wrote most songs this cd . " chance my heart " new standard he performs it magic . there third standard cd he plays piano roaring twenties , but not sing " five foot two " his playing out this world it other songs make up this cd . while michael buble recycles same old trite songs his cd ad nauseam , mr. desare swings his own rhythm , ryhme , playing . truly wonderful singer his own style young male crooners imitating years come	1
i bought " where sun never go down " found it " nice " . fine singing , nice arrangements , but very concert-like , very correct , uninspired , except " twelve gates city " . possibilities cut made me buy this cd , there no doubt guys got it right this time . this fine gospel singing you hear . if you think dixie hummingbirds or golden gate quartet or abyssinian church choir or aretha franklin james cleveland " precious memories " , this cd place right up there recordings those luminaries	1
review i saw broke down each song . i pretty well agree those assessments so i not go direction . i say balance childhood adulthood often confusing just late sixties early seventies . john sebastian seems put some order choatic time life period time . i truly enjoyed this vinyl really appreciate cd quality . super talent , super quality , super cd . if you get chance pick up tarzana kid , too	1
this just great cd ! not too hard not too soft	1
all records post-punk , grunge or whatever era , this one blends so many things together it one most unique hard-hitters era . lyrics border bizarre observations some darker realities our world , but enough humour you really can't take anything too seriously . music so hard-hitting ways few other people ever , yes , like so many other reviews , it aged nicely . few bands touch this , period . patton soaring vocals range inspiration empowerment like few others . all sounds crashing together so well make me wish i'd caught these guys live during tour this masterpiece . also , like many other reviewers , this among my all-time favorites	1
really good record .. definitely one those needs your collection	-1

2nd yes album , 1970 " time word , " saw band add some orchestral arrangements some their songs . some fans turned off it , even yes themselves now say they don't think orchestral touches album worked completely ( band would not take orchestral accompanyment again until 2001 " magnification " ) . personally , i'm not bothered one bit orchestral flourishes . they don't * bury * band , heaven sake , i think they enhance songs they're used very well . yes themselves still main attraction throughout " time word , " album excellent . it features several my personal favorite yes songs , such amazing cover richie havens ' " no opportunity necessary , no experience needed , " captivating sounds " then , " perfect pop-rock " sweet dreams , " supremely powerful rock " astral traveller " ( killer guitar riff peter banks ) , great beauty closing title track . band top form " time word , " they also say goodbye guitarist banks , who would replaced longtime guitarist steve howe shortly after album release ( so shortly , fact , original us album cover features group photo howe , even though banks guitarist album ! ) . i've always loved " time word . " it very strong yes album , i highly recommend it .	1

first it kind sounds good , but then track 2 starts it same piano riff same thing all tracks . after while it hard tell whether you listening different song , or if track 3 reprise tracks 1 2 . i guess if you like it then you like whole thing , because whole album sounds like comp same jam .	-1

" lifesong " casting crowns second studio effort . title track starts things off powerful light rock message . there , " praise you storm " slower , powerful song accepting all trials tribulations thrown your way still managing thank god them ( think job ) . it my favorite song album it timely song well considering recent onslaught hurricanse last year . " anybody hear her " strong song this album . my second favorite song , " stained glass masquerade , " speaks volumes . hypocrites run rampant throughout every church , this song addresses them . rest album just strong these first few , especially " while you sleeping . " if you've never heard casting crowns before , they lot like mercy me even matt redman . also , lead vocalist , mark hall , very steven curtis chapman-like sound his voice . lot music here reminds me chapman during mid 90 . overall , wonderful album any fan light rock bands such mercy me . highly recommended	-1

joe bonamassa sophmore effort holds few surprises . first slight shift musical direction . much like jeff healey , joe opted less overt blues approach his second album . result 62 minutes powerful rock focus original songwriting , strong hooks , broader musical landscape . both bonamassa guitar playing vocals undeniably sensational , his band tight unrelenting ever . their spectacular performances run gamot hard edged grooves ( " lie #1 " , " no slack " ) , lighter acoustic shades ( " waiting me " , " never say goodbye " , " mountain time " ) , searing guitar ( " pain sorrow " ) , hard rock ( " takin ' hit " , " hard way " ) , few points . those fans looking more straight forward blues tunes , i'm afraid only title track offers this form mid-tempo shuffle . but aside , this fantastic album , its own would worthy four stars . but that where second surprise comes . originally , when i bought this year ago , amazon listed second disk dvd " new day yesterday - live " . since all information offered i assumed it promo clip showing joe band performing title track his debut album . what this actually phenominal full length live performance taped back december 21 , 2001 while touring behind " new day yesterday " . this blinding show displays bonamassa blazing chops mind-numbing tone tee . i've played this thing more times than i count , it good . fact , i so impressed i actually bought same wine red les paul classic joe starts show ( yes i know ... insane . but you guitar players out there know exactly what i'm talking ) . here're details : cradle rock - steppin ' out/rice pudding - new day yesterday - miss you hate you - walk my shadows - i know where i belong - color shape - trouble waiting - if heartaches nickels - don't burn down bridge - guitar solo - you experienced ? - cry today . total performance runs around 1 hour 52 minutes . extras include music video miss you , hate you 5-6 minute vh1-style bio . there also photo gallery . dvd itself easily worth five stars . i know there lot fans out there who very strict views blues/rock guitarists what they should shouldn't . if you feel you fit into this category you might not like cd so much but i think you'll love dvd . it certainly delivers everything you're looking ( assuming you enjoy live concert dvd course ! ) . if your tastes bit broader , i think this 2 disk set grand slam twice price . absolutely .	1

i purchased this album upon its release years ago , it still one my favorites . music simply not date ... partially because maire brennan crafted such beautiful album otherworldly timeless partially because instrumentation traditional , primitive , but exciting . i still believe this her best solo effort ( even though i love all her albums ) . brennan clan ( including enya bridin ) all amazing vocalists songwriters . grateful their talents	1
bridge , album plays absolutely no testament band whose ability far superceedes this pile [ garbage ] . i listening bt 15 years now , seeing them doing live shows jersey area late 80 . if you want great album , buy " save his soul , " dont waste your time this garbage . im sorry bobby . dead , he truly backbone this band , listen any early stuff his bass clearly prominent . its shame	-1
there not enough " good songs " this cd warrant purchase . besides , 80s not really time " hard rock classics " ... oh , sure , there few , but 80s dominated androgynous " synth " players ... it really crappy time music . course , there police , pretenders , blue oyster cult , ozzy , but i'm sorry , those " hair bands " ... gross ... even van halen fizzled . you could say , " but john , whadda ' 1984' ? " what it ? it wasn't " diver down " or " women children first " or even " van halen " ( incredible 1978 debut album ) ... no , 80s music stunk most part . i think saddest song this whole album " lick it up " ... you lick it up , you it ... i used kiss posters my walls , man ... i used dress up like gene simmons halloween . song just made me ill . just thinking ... ewww ... i just don't want go there . so , please ... save your money . all you kiddies who going " retro " thinking 80s put out some good stuff , save your money or if you spend some money , buy anything led zeppelin , doors , or alman brothers you'll spending wisely music outlast whatever phase you currently into . peace blessings , children ..	-1

you won't find africa or rosanna this album . there no sappy love jingles included this release . trademark 80 pop sound make many dismiss toto expendable fad 1982 nowhere found . credit , if you want , new bass player mike porcaro , who replaced david hungate shortly after release toto iv . or you give it new lead singer fergie fredricksen , who seemed take full control band when he replaced bobby kimball ' 83 . whatever case , you give band credit not getting caught up success iv ; deciding still experiment new sounds . result 80 rock it finest . david paich steve porcaro great together keyboards . steve lukather great always guitar . jeff porcaro talents finally utilized their full potential . , course , fergie voice well-suited . while their follow-ups : ' fahrenheit ' ' seventh one ' both good , they don't quite match up . notoriety , however , come short this album , seeing it only spawned one top 30 ' stranger town ' , which also critically acclaimed music video . but , don't let this one slip !	1

my opinion , slayer first five albums all easily 5 star thrash metal classics should without doubt every metalheads catalog . there somthing this album just really drew me . one thing definitely darker , haunting tones they went album . it definitely slower than slayer previous albums , but it darker , more unique style it . guitars really seem heavier than ever this album , almost like sludge/doom metal still all thrash elements , including insane double bass drumming always mr. lombardo . tom araya voice much clearer " south " he doesn't sing nearly fast like previous efforts when it sometimes incredibly hard make out what he saying . he definitely adds more melody structure his voice . also , there not quite much talk demons , satan , violence . course , there still quite bit it . come , this slayer we're talkin ' here . you expect some . slayer songs still pretty short . title track longest clocking just under 5 minutes . my personal favorites here course classics- south heaven , mandatory suicide , also spill blood behind crooked cross . spill blood really something new slayer . it haunting/dark acoustic intro . which i absolutely love . it extremely unique , especially slayer . araya started writing majority lyrics also this album , always axe slingers , kerry king jeff hanneman wrote musical parts . no mediocre tracks appear here , but if i choose i would say judas priest cover song , dissident aggressor cleanse soul would my least favorites . whole album flows very smoothly together . every song it place no songs out place here . everthing goes together just right . so if you'd like hear slayer bit darker , sludgier tone it , pick up south heaven . this would 2nd last album their incredible/classic lineup until dave lombardo would leave replaced exceptional paul bostaph . if you don't slayer album or haven't heard much them , i reccomend this , reign blood , or seasons abyss	1
this album bangin just like all d.j. quik albums my favorite song quot ; jus lyke bomptonquot ; if you nice system your car it your favorite too . i don't know why fool tim dogg tried diss homie quik but who cares because more people know quik then some clown named tim dogg	1
run pack ( 1976 . ) bad company third album . 1976 , bad company really beginning make name themselves . group , which combined free paul rodgers simom kirke , king crimson boz burell , mott hoople mick ralphs , showing excellent classic rock alliance showed no signs letting down anytime soon . band first two albums nothing short excellent , no classic rock fan deny it . what would come next band ? 1976 , group released its third album , run pack . how would it measure up comparison its predecessors - better or worse ? read my review . i personally thought straight shooter bit step down bad company debut ( though still good album ) , but any feelings i may band quality diminishing shattered run pack . this , my opinion , classic bad company formation ultimate album . although it didn't many hits , say , band 1974 debut , quality music nothing less . this album captures band prime no other . starting things off classic rock anthem live music , which unquestionably one finest tunes group ever recorded . simple man honey child lighter numbers no less excellent , show off those amazing vocals only paul rodgers . then we get title track , which minor hit . this song classic rock masterpiece , combining elements harder classic rock more melodic ones - even employing some orchestral arrangements . after we go right into album big hit , silver blue gold . bad company actually recorded quite few ballads , but this one just might best bunch . combining melodic song structure elements classic pop-rock , band succeeded creating masterpiece . strangest album track comes next - it cover old coasters song young blood . i serious doubts band covering coasters , but my doubts shattered when i heard song . though not best work here , it still solid - it kills coasters versions dead . closing out album several underrated bad company tunes you're not likely hear radio any time soon , including masterful fade away . bad company created six awesome albums paul rodgers frontman , this one remains best bunch my book . i don't see how anyone call this " decline " band ! bad company albums got remastered reissued , but sadly remastered versions nothing special . you get remastered sound but nothing else . no expanded liner notes , no bonus tracks , no twofers ... which blows . there many rare non-lp bad company tracks would made great bonuses ( many which bonus cuts anthology . ) this doesn't change my feelings album all , but bad company albums deserve better treatment ! run pack flat out rules . bad company never sounded this good before never would again . however , starting this album , band would begin downward slide off pop charts - though their music would remain good , they would forgotten due changing musical trends world . run pack ultimate bad company album . admittingly , this bit more aquired taste than band self-titled debut ( which where new fans should start ) , but if you're tried true bad company fan , buy this one . you not regret it . just give it some time grow you before you judge it	1
there three people who responsible " resurrection " goldberg variations , least far general publicis concerned : wanda landoska , rosalyn tureck , glenn gould . without them , goldberg variations certainly would not get attention they , may ended up curiosity music students discover budget labels performers seeking overblown romantic interpetations or sterile " period correct " ( other words , uninformed ) performances leave listeners yawning . instead , thanks those three , goldberg well know even casual music listener beethoven pathetique or mozart rondo la turka . now , i certainly believe landowska rendition most well informed , even most revolutionary terms true period correctness ( she first record it harpsichord correct baroque ornamentation ) , she musicality made listener believe they listening orchestra instead just single keyboardist . tureck interpretation so dancelike pleasant . it sounds so free happy , i get image there dancers keys her piano . she really one showed goldberg variations could performed piano without reverting overly romanticized versions dominated up time . it landowska tureck two allowed what arguably most famous interpretation goldbergs : glenn gould 1955 recording . inspired landowska passion early music right , tureck justified piano performance stood out head shoulders above others , gould combined best elements two added his own rhythmic dynamic perfection create masterpiece recording . his tempi ( general ) nearly twice fast most performers ' , indeed his own 1981 recording , which , places , i prefer ( refer variations 1 , 5 , 10 , 14 , 16 , 29 ) , yet he always control never sounds like he straining get next note . his staccato light touch give it wonderful bell-like clarity , it closest you'll get harpsichord recording piano . yes , his 1981 recording more mature , but it difference interpretation than technical prowess , i think choice two comes down mood , even , mentioned above , individual variations . this recording his first studio recording , presenting all fire passion twenty three year old showing world he got something prove . odd choice first recording , most pianists would probably forced into some half-hearted renditions chopin or mozart , but gould knew what he doing . he must known time right bach interpretation paid homage greatness achieved past well one strode confidently into future , future where ( philosophy like landowska ) old music no longer quaint but revered modern music didn't seek " revolutionize " but instead sought build upon . this increasingly prevalent attitude 1950 1960 thanks people like landowska , harnoncourt , , course , gould . we see this philosophy durufle , de falla ( one first twentieth century composers write harpsichord ) , later stravinsky . gould goldbergs played no small part baroque new birth . yourself favor get both gould goldbergs , wanda landowska goldbergs , perhaps koroliov goldbergs or tatiana nikolayeva goldbergs . you'll quite glad you	1
if you really like gospel music don't waste your money this cd . these beautiful hymns deserve better treatment . flat uninspired generous description this cd	-1
okay , previous ( negative ) reviewers all pointed out how this album not technical or original their earlier work . recently acquired progressive fear i kiss burning darkness , i'll agree slaughter soul monolithic tempo , repeated riffs conventional rock song structure don't match up weird , almost hiccupy changes tempo , odd song structures , constantly changing guitar riffs moments shear silence previous album . there nothing blazingly original here " raped light christ " or " non divine . " indeed these guys just don't -do- much three minutes they before . but what this album lacks technicality progressiveness ( proginess ? ) i'd argue it makes up its sheer melodic/harmonic catchiness , catchiness leaves gates ' brutality untouched . it achievement i think only one other band achieving metal history , one , like gates , flirted mainstream success but never quite made it : testament , their first album , legacy . no , gates don't sound like testament , but combination catchy melodic/harmonic hooks aggression what made legacy so great ( alex skolnic guitar solos , course ) . legacy , fairly monolithic pace slaughter soul makes it unrelenting its assault . far making it less brutal , catchiness this album even enhances brutality boring dark riffs relentless rhythm into your subconscious . this , wonderfully agonized vocals just-fuzzy-enough production make album quite atmospheric , evoking inklings some combination despair homicidal frenzy . it not nearly claustrophobic , frenzied or despairing greats black or doom metal like esoteric weakling , but songs catchier more accessible thus atmosphere rubs off you more easily . but then you'd hope it'd brutal much looking track list . speaking which , if you don't want read album detail , skip end this review . when i say something `great ' or awesome , i mean it simply sounds good . i admitted before , this not very technical album . standout tracks " blinded fear " wonderful opening track you ask this album . after suitably ominous electronic fuzz spoken-word clip it establishes driving rhythm album its dark atmosphere great guitar riffing . there very brief bridge/solo last minutes , but it extremely brief doesn't make this song any ' slower ' or more subtle while giving it melodic edge such blunt instrument would normally lack . 5 stars " slaughter soul " starts off very short , heavy intro section before going into song proper . this every other song album nutshell . things always changing enough you don't get bored , but not so much you can't follow them . there really great interplay two guitars so they compliment each other rather than dueling total over-the-top metal fashion . 4 stars " cold " features great solo more fabulous guitar work , point it stands above other excellent material album . 5 stars " into dead sky " nice quiet instrumental interlude musical blows face . it not great itself but it fits perfectly . 4 stars " need " my opinion best song album . nice varied , going melody melody brutal guitar riffs until it fades out , almost serenely , into single glockenspiel over silence . so yeah . 11 catchy , brutal tracks together make one most accessible most influential albums 90 . addition their gothenburg contemporaries successors it massive impact metalcore-listen darkest hour mark judas you can't hope but hear shadow this album . terms making serious metal accessible , this album knows few peers save legacy testament sham mirrors arcturus . indeed , i'd say this album gates invented pop death metal , which no mean feat . i don't recommend this if you require your metal extremely technical ( opeth ) or experimental ( ephel duath ) nor if you prefer it so raw it sounds like it recorded bear cave some scandinavian forest ( burzum , leviathan ) or so brutal it makes you're eardrums bleed ( pig destroyer ) . but if you like metal you like good conventional rock songwriting , this treat	1

whether you're fan new doctor who tv series or not , if you enjoy soundtracks this album excellent buy . murray gold cinematic-style orchestral arrangments range dramatic eerie wistful . i like this album playing while i type , read , or work other creative projects since it inspirational without distractions lyrics . also included two " apocryphal " radio pop songs , " love don't roam " " song ten , " written specifically program . both stand their own merits quite well , provide fans in-jokes series itself -- only downside " song ten " re-recorded version , rather than one originally played tv series ( which i rather prefer ) . personal faves : haunting " doctor theme , " meditative " impossible planet , " dramatic " dalek " theme , complete alien-language chorus .	1

( 2 ) n.o.r.e " nothin '" a- . so simple , yet so enjoyable same time . n.o.r.e. terrific voice " arabian style " background provides very catchy tune . it just may run little long , but still keeps listener interest . ( 3 ) eve feat . alicia keys " gangsta lovin '" . this song lives up everything we expect eve alicia . just like " let me blow ya mind " it loaded style very sexy well . it takes very talented artists pull off song this well . ( 4 ) beenie man feat . janet " feel it boy " b+ . no means classic , this atleast good romantic rap . beenie man relaxed style combined janet smooth voice make this sweet romantic duet . nice look positive side rap . ( 5 ) dirty vegas " days go " . i don't really get techno , yet this song such haunting effect . words beat carry certain dimension stikes within soul . this song doesn't need over top strike our minds . ( 6 ) kylie minogue " love first sight " a- . kylie could sing phone book make it sound great . her voice takes standard song such this rises it nerw levels . this what good dance song should : meaningful infectious same time . ( 7 ) shakira " objection ( tango ) " . latin beat makes this song sucessfull it chosen level , but it could more . shakira makes catchy latin tune alot energy , even if it lacks impact " whenever , wherever " . ( 8 ) no doubt feat . lady saw " underneath it all " . gwen stefani just lays back lets words take over make extremly touching pop song . lyrics so much depth power even when lady saw comes , we don't mind her . one ' 02 best songs career best no doubt . ( 9 ) jennifer love hewitt " barenaked " b- . she terrible actress , but half decent singer . this debut contains some terrific ideas images , yet cops out become standard pop . makes you wish they stayed right track . ( 10 ) vanessa carlton " ordinary day " . this solid ballad just lacks resonance " thousand miles " " pretty baby " . still her voice piano talents make it worth while listen some more strong images . ( 11 ) dixie chicks " landslide " . again , country isn't my cup tea , but this song works me . girls ' make this fleetwood mac song their own add some bluegrass flavor unique acoustic arrangements . ( 12 ) aaliyah " i care 4 u " b+ . relaxing rb track late singer just runs bit too long . her voice just flows so smoothly beat so relaxing song keeps us interested until very end , despite length . ( 13 ) ginuwine " stingy " . yet artist who just lets music flow create wonderful work . this good old fashioned rb tune just makes you feel better its posiitive " story " . ginuwine finds perfect words just combines then beat create masterpiece . ( 14 ) norah jones " don't know why " c+ . what this song doing 2002 ? everything it seems outdated unfinished , like producers just stopped trying . what little substance here lost because listeners put sleep .

( 16 ) hoobastank " running away " b+ . first right step : song appropriate length considering material . second : voices good flow true conviction . third : catchy guitar chords . result : surprisingly effective rock song . ( 17 ) coldplay " my place " b- . nowhere near boring " clocks " , yet same flaws because group love their insturments . certain stretches middle contain enough style keep some interest through this stumbling rock song . ( 18 ) creed " one last breath " a- . usual , creed finds perfect words convey their message utilize some good guitar beats add some depth . it may sound like some their other work , but still gets job very nicely . ( 19 ) our lady peace " somewhere out there " . good rock song just doesn't break out ordinary . track some good material , but falls back standard stuff when it should tightening it all up . if only they some more confidence their work . ( 20 ) bon jovi " everyday " . jon bon jovi proves he still hip ever , while he cranks up energy this pop/rock track . it simple side , yet filled some meaning alot sound fury we get caught up music . bottom line : *** 1/2 . nice sample music 2002 , includes number year best singles . " now " series shows no hints slowing down , demonstates this edition there no limits either .	1

billy joel tenth studio album , " bridge " featured no very big hits highlighted more mellow style songwriting than his normal , catchy , rock-beat songs previous albums . people debated whether he growing old , whether he still what it takes make successful rock song . some even accepted , sure , little bit his flair missing his music more " adult contemporary " , but they'll take it . then came " storm front " . within first fifteen or so seconds first song album , " that not her style " , world knew joel back his old great form . every song showed flavors classic joel : " that not her style " contained infectious , catchy refrain dastardly beat reminiscent " half mile away " " 52nd street " . " we didn't start fire " , though not popular among critics even fans , showed joel still knew exactly what pop industry needed , song bolted #1 billboard charts . " downeaster alexa " displayed joel love storytelling through song , previously seen " scenes italian restaurant " " zanzibar " . " i go extremes " reminded us joel hendrix piano . " shameless " reassured us , even after all those years , billy could still make meaningful , catchy , excellent love song . list goes . every song reminds us , somehow , billy roots pop industry . there no filler this album . everybody likes some songs , dislikes others . but nothing low quality or uninteresting . so whether you buy this album " we didn't start fire " or just because you're interested kind music billy make , just sure buy it . bottom line : " i go extremes " ? " shameless " ? " so it goes " ? monumental pop hit " we didn't start fire " ? how could this not essential ? prepare yourself some best pop-rock all time	1

suzy never achieved level commercial success her talent deserved but she nevertheless built significant fan base america , britain elsewhere . suzy voice echoes emmylou harris ( no bad thing , ) certainly one best country singers her generation - or any generation . drawing suzy nineties recordings capitol , this contains most songs you would expect find . it pity they didn't license her country hit duet lee greenwood ( hopelessly yours ) but if you want it , you find it lee greenwood compilation . this compilation shows suzy could record oldies contemporary material equal brilliance . oldies represented someday soon ( first popularised judy collins but also recorded crystal gayle among others ) , jailhouse now ( old jimmie rodgers classic ) i want cowboy sweetheart ( million-seller patsy montana thirties ) . my favorite oldie recorded suzy ( take it limit ) isn't here but found common thread , eagles tribute album . joy lynn white ( brilliant but obscure country singer ) first record cold day july . suzy covered it few years later but it became better known when covered dixie chicks . elsewhere , there many outstanding songs including just like weather , diamonds tears , give me some wheels , hey cinderella letting go , just name few . if you only ever buy one collection suzy country music , you may well choose this one	1

after triumph ' ziggy stardust ' , david bowie wrote number songs while tour would end up becoming " aladdin sane " album . featuring " spiders mars " band ( guitarist mick ronson , bassist trevor bolder drummer mick woodmansey ) pianist mike garson added mix , bowie compositions found him exploring not only glam sounds he made his own , but also taking older pop forms bringing them into his idiom . nowhere latter illustrated his head first cover " let spend night together " . song taken fiercely uptempo , bowie voice ranting above frantic piano ronson churning rhythm guitar . but embracing doo-wop phil spector style pop clearly illustrated cuts like superb " drive-in saturday " ( one bowie most powerful vocal deliveries record ) " prettiest star " . bowie also tackles blues rock , churning " jean genie " , its snarling lead vocal chugging guitar line . also mix decent take ' 60s rock ( " watch man " ) , something totally bizarre ( indescribable title track , which after decade since i first discovered this album college i still can't make my mind up ) , jagged , frantic fierce moody glam workout ( " panic detroit " ) probably proves real highlight album . bonus disc this set proves nice compliment handful live tracks , rare " sax version " " john , i'm only dancing " ( original version ' ziggy stardust ' limited release ) until recently unheard studio take " all young dudes " bowie . " aladdin sane " end up bit rushed feel -- songs sound like they written tour -- but this lends nice , nervous energy it sort hard describe . bowie cooling off bit this one -- it not quite essential his previous couple albums , but it still fantastic record . recommended	-1

this got best thrash album all time prove it here it well first lyrics just insane unpredictable un-comparable brutality any other album ever realesed period true . second consistency entire album even extra tracks new release never let up i listened alot thrash albums this one never let up somebody say master puppets bla lets up like little **** all over place peace sells same same same same all other albums none consistent . third vocals precision guitar attacks like no other maybe some other bands one or two song hypes but never whole album never never never never like this . finally artwork which just icing cake but very well depict exactly what you going get so there it i proved my point . anyone who disrespects this #1 thrash album all time not thrash fan or just can't swallow somthing so insainly perfect or just jealous moron . until you seen them perform this thing it entirety right front you , you no right criticizing this masterpiece cd great but when it actually played right front you you never expereince precision involved so all underage or jealous fags shut *** up .	1

grateful dead warm-up band janis joplin fillmore east . they two seperate 1 hour shows mostly different audiences . ( bill graham used schedule two complete shows night maximize profits ) . grateful dead , they not any repeats one show next . constrained one hour show , dead played little bit differently than they would normal concert . some songs little truncated . but , some cases , it turns out good interesting thing . i love long , rambling jams , but it good sometimes hear band play tighter , more concise mode . one song really benefits shorter time turn your lovelight . it very energetic there searing guitar highlighted . many other songs also very good . sound quality fair good ( professional standards ) . sound little rough spots . audience noise little high times ( other grateful dead live albums great , because you almost never audience noise interferring music ) . there other grateful dead live cd this time period much better sound . thing i really don't like they included complete concerts . each concert couple minute introduction . included all chatter songs . they even included whole time band down while guitar string changed , so there long period middle cd just silence.at end second show , after we bid you goodnight , there several minute pause , then band breaks into cosmic charlie . 2 minutes into cosmic charlie it sounds like tape went bad , song cut off cd ends . some people love thses complete concerts , everything kept " give you feel concert " . me , i just want enjoy music	-1

some reason , most 1970-1990 mccartney/wings catalogue now available two versions : capitol cds british remastered " mccartney collection " . british cd offer , many cases , more bonus tracks than capitol cd , this release they same though . why not include junior farm ??? remastering british series , my ears , not bonus . signal compressed such way , average level louder than capitol cd , although peaks not . balance changed : low frequencies boosted , resulting somewhat muddy sound less focused midrange . this also affected stereo image . me , capitol cds sonically superior closer original lps . i found remastered sound disappointment , not doing justice obvious care went into original production !	-1

my mind this amercian culture masterpiece so don't hesitate buy this album appeals heart , mind ear . if you're misfortune fall into catagory those think journey some phony arena rock/pop music band 80 then you'll also even more misfortune miss out one best live albums all time which showcases band thats roots founded deep within era mid 70 . i just don't think any one band ever mixed blues/jazz music into pop style quite like journey . journey exemplifies beauty american pop music true unique art form its own right . they give us reason proud utter words american pop music . hell even down ancient egyptian scarib they chose their symbol shows how deep there roots go into america which i'm sure most you out there unaware our founding fathers obsession ancient egypt ( read " explodong myths " vol . 1 ) . kudos out sound engineers live recordings found here highest quality .	1
chevelle first album might come shock those initiated more recent albums ( " wonder what next " " this type thinking ( could us " )) , mainly because it sounds like totally different band ! not their new style bad thing , i love chevelle , new sound working them just well , but " point #1 , " their debut , just phenomenal . undiscovered gem . i've this cd since it release 1999 , so listening it provides lot nostalgia me , it holds special place my heart . this album full passion , intensity pure emotion . pete loeffler , guitarist vocalist , shines through thoughtful , often cryptic poetic lyrics , while his voice often echoes maynard james keenan , but it own distinct sound . his brothers , joe sam , back him up bass drums ( respectively ) dynamic three unbelieveable . despite fact they reportedly fight lot , whenever they get together , combination explosive shows music . album begins appropriately titled " open , " two minute instrumental primes you up album , showcases some solid musicianship . song bleeds into next , now classic " point #1 , " which my personal favorite chevelle song all time ( anyone remember creepy video they it ? ) , shows off what chevelle all . album continues fast pace , slowing down briefly emotionally draining beautiful " dos , " but pace picked up more uptempo tracks like " sma " " mia . " lot people tote chevelle tool sound-alikes , but i only hear it pete voice . musically , i always though them more common helmet , displayed songs like " skeptic " " long . " " prove you " one defining moments album , pretty much only song sounds all like what they today . album whole just beautiful . i'm sure many new people discovering this album , due their success , realizing what chevelle all . it may take few listens adjust , especially if you already own newer material , but it album sure very long shelf-life . not many albums made like this anymore , just plain raw , stripped down , pure . that what " point #1 " all , if you love music , this album you	1

i really like this cd , because you hear weariness , wariness , waylon , kris , willie , johnny voices , aging like fine wine or whiskey . song selection especially strong -- " last cowboy song , " their harmonies melding perfectly , captures mythic tone they set out accomplish , . " desperados waiting train " continues theme , " jim i wore tie today " propels message further , love , loss , death constant theme throughout . given whipped-up furor over immigrants news today , standout track me beautiful touching version woody guthrie " deportee ( plane wreck los gatos ) " willie voice chorus , backed johnny rodriguez singing spanish , this easily one best versions this song i've heard . sure , production mid-80s , some synthetic drums keyboard washes i could without , but all this very strong entry these heroes . pick this up road goes forever , " you bookended their legendary career together	-1
though principly known songwriter country artists , jim lauderdale always genre buster , fusing elements country , rock , bluegrass , rhythm blues , folk , 70's-style pop into solid catalog songs . after several promising but inconsistant ( now out print ) solo albums , lauderdale finally hit his stride performer quot ; whisper . quot ; quot ; onward through it allquot ; continues blaze same trail . opener quot ; you just knowquot ; would home dwight yoakam record . title cut definitive jim lauderdale song . quot ; trust ( guiding star)quot ; make you lonely your grateful dead records . quot ; we really shouldn't doing thisquot ; hit george strait . quot ; please san antone , quot ; quot ; almost next nothing , quot ; quot ; still not out woodsquot ; also highlights	1
aside cover ( minor detail but hard ignore compared previous covers ' glory ) this me best record their career . it got all classic elements their sound but takes into account what happened sonically rest music world since key lime pie acts accordingly . fact they push envelope further than most set standard higher than it ever rock music . so it musically serious , even little serious lyrically , but overall it funny enjoyable , even if it little dark times . after hearing these songs live i better understanding where they coming politically . it more subtle than lyrics let , not serious one may think reading review . i mean , it obvious cvb ( whole lot other folks ) against current right-wing atmosphere today , it comes through music , but don't mistake this cd political statement cause it not . it rock roll record dives into fantasy whim such both silly beautiful . even little pissed off . engineering production top notch , record big , full presence pretty close glory their live sound , they put lot effort into making every little corner mix interesting . overall this fantastic record triumphant return , almost like they'd rehearsing secret whole time not split up all these years .	-1
cualquier atisbo de sensatez que uno podria esperar queda desfigurado desde el primer surco ..... actitud circense , promiscuidad de versiones , vejacion al legado beatle , exageracion crudeza en estereo , esta grabacion te deja el laser alcoholizado !!!!!!!!! dificilmente se pueda hallar tanta locura , ingenuidad , salvajismo arrogancia en un recital de casi cuarenta a�os atras ....... despues de todo , el rocknroll no es eso ?????????????	-1
these guys sound , attitude , some great new surf songs . it like travelling back ' 63 finding surf band musicians who'd actually playing their instruments more than couple weeks ! these guys really good . if you like surf music , or if you even think you like it , you love this album . if you play surf guitar ( like me ) , there lots great hooks new riffs here borrow ! long live eliminators	1

sonic youth goo definite indie rock masterpiece . opening " dirty boots " , " my friend goo " ( my favorite song album because it just so damn catchy ) , closing " titanium expose " , this record it all . if you're just getting into sonic youth , i would recommend picking up this album " dirty " . it might take little while get into cause it really different , but take chance . you'll glad you	-1
i heard " la negra tomasa " parties whatnot even knew words song . few years later i introduced caifanes , more specifically this album . i loved all tracks , every single one them when i heard " la negra tomasa " i couldn't believe this their song . every single song great meaning poetic way i hadn't heard great while . i immediately fell love caifanes . there out i heard all their songs , bought all their albums then got into jaguares . i'm one their biggest fans now i'm even going go see them concert hollywood september . i know seeing them live absolutely spectacular i'll morph into even bigger fan . i love caifanes/jaguares i love saul angelic voice . i'm not huge rock fan ( though i love mana ) , i'm more into hip hop rb so you know if i like it everyone like it . i haven't heard words so deep endearing long time . i'm so grateful this band came into my life .	1
while one can't argue price this 2-cd set , one wonders why all these redundant compilations dusty music necessary ? , since most them released after her untimely death 1999 , there certain aroma crass cashing serving what this writer calls necrophiliac music market . it seems every time musician dies , their record sales skyrocket . it happened elvis , janis joplin , jimi hendrix , jim morrison , et al . other words , who raking this dough ? certainly not late great artist . , therein lies tragic irony dusty springfield . it would appear dusty more albums released after her way too early demise than she ever life . this but one many postmortem compilations floating around . while song choices cover just every phase dusty 40-year career , including her early days springfields , their chronology totally ignored . why this album doesn't begin springfields ' tracks followed dusty first solo hit " i only want you " defies logic . why first disc ends kurt weill-esque " soft core " second disc begins insipid , non-dusty hit " close you " but one example disjointed , herky-jerky musical progression this album . no prevailing theme no natural segues , this album leaves listener confused unsatisfied . this writer gave it 4 stars only because it dusty . however , if you're truly springfield aficionado , might i suggest you pay extra money purchase brilliant 4-disc compilation , " simply dusty " - nearly 100 track , well-thought-out , chronological remastered compilation dusty finest work . dust one 20th century most gifted vocalists/musicians . while this album give listener more than glimpse her incredible talent , way this set organized not accord new dusty springfield fan opportunity hear how dusty grew changed artist . " simply dusty " tells whole story - this set merely disjointed fragments fantastic talent life work .	-1
viva charlie standing up portugese dictatorship ... not too long ago !!!	1
if you bought ' live fillmore east ' now looking some more stuff this band , i think this album you looking . most it blues/rock but ' dreams ' got jazzy feel it ' black hearted woman ' bit faster than rest songs . although i enjoy all these songs i'd say strongest point ' whipping post ' weakest point ' hoochie coochie man ' song sung bassist berry oakley . i think everyone this band amazing duane dickey solos really inspiring any guitarist . greg skills hammond b-3 way he sings some these songs tells you he felt this sorrow before . there 70+ minutes music this cd , so it very good value	-1
this 1976 recording one best electronic recordings all time . very original not describable words , even jarre not surpassed this release last 30 years . he still trying	1
i'd love add this my desktop collection if you know where i download it free please let me kno	1
if you've fan damned any substantial period time , you most likely own copy damned damned damned . my copy well worn vinyl i subsequently replaced it other copies . i say other copies because this album it original form punk rock masterpiece . what more could get me run out buy version ? well , let just say impossible possible . 30th anniversary edition damned damned damned well worth tracking down . states , it hard-to-find import definitely worth search . original release contained first cd generous amount bonus material following two discs , most previously unreleased except pesky bootlegs appeared over years . damned one greatest punk bands ever emerge uk while some site clash one punk band mattered , i'd beg differ . both bands rocky history sorts , but damned came through it their heads held high managed write one best comeback albums any band career ( grave disorder-check it out ! ) . fans their punk years eat this up fans their later more gothic era . up punks , this one album each every punk rocker should own , it genius	1
i'll brief . this performance vanguard incredible ! i just want say piece " oasis " many ways changed my life when i first listened it 1979 . there so much force energy jarrett troupe . it indeed spiritual exhausting . bravo .............	1
what i say , except i absolutely adore this man music this particular recording consists his most beautiful compositions re-recorded specifically this one recording . i played this cd even more than my other john barry recordings ( which quite few ) . anyone who adores respects this brilliant composer i love this cd ! mr. barry even included 2 compositions never heard before , which simply beautiful . i've fan this man many , many years amp ; i usually buy his soundtracks even if i've never even seen film , he never disappointed me yet ! me , there no other soundtrack composer like john barry . those not familiar his work , this particular cd would one i'd recommend your first purchase -- you'll hooked want purchase every soundtrack man . thank you , john barry	1
there many brilliant moments within this recording including some solos , but use too much brass organ give it too much ' production number ' feel . { my experience messiah includes singing it stage carnegie hall avery fisher hall ~ 30 times total among other venues - bass section member . } while not true purist all choral members male [ ala boy sopranos altos ... ] harpsichord , limited brass fairly small orchestra better suited baroque music renditions which supposed emotive , evocative spiritual . this rendition just too far into big , brassy bassy better zone !	-1
i wrote original review bottom list - jan . 1999 . i still play this album it never grows old . jams ( they still say ??? ) zagora make me shiver . maybe because memories they invoke . nothing but some best music ever come out 80 . quot ; you can't stop rainquot ; - still classic . you ever heard anything sensual relaxing one ? i think not ! buy it , listen it , swoon it . all means , cuddle up your man it	1

back when i college oldin way novelty let city boys like me sniff country air i no idea just how pure sincere band is/was . there different configurations this band still playing , but this original band caught live 1973 . it pure grass ( not panama red kind . ) band exhibits depth respect originals takes this listener breath away ( none flying burritos hipster sneer here ) . song choice great : jigs , hymns , blues covers . it clocks 70 mins , not counting bonus track . it dawg/acoustic discs quality . grass bluer these sides i'm buying more dawg/garcia . thanks dawg making it available ..	1
neville marriner first recording messiah , recorded 1976 , without doubt his best recording work . marriner recorded handel most famous oratorio his academy st. martin fields decca , it not confused later german language version munich emi , or 1992 live concert ( philips ) soloists who not level 1976 decca recording . marriner takes generally fast , refreshing tempos choruses keeps light texture , but he knows where slow down , academy players so good : sync marriner every nuance tempo fluctuation ( these few , but sometimes music calls slight changes tempo or expression . ) " unto us child born " most satisfying i've heard , it really moves , yet never seems rushed . all soloists excellent , really understanding handel style writing voice , meaning text , drawn old new testaments bible . they not operatic voices , but more attuned intimate side late baroque oratorio . keep mind , though , intimate not mean " namby pamby " or " wimpy . " choruses very hearty indeed , heft orchestra always appropriate big moments , yet never sacrificing grace big sound . this also complete messiah , bargain 2 discs . ormandy bernstein ( both sony ) not complete , but really extended excerpts . if you must period instruments , try hogwood/academy ancient music ( l'oiseau lyre , 1980 , boys/men choir ) or gardiner/english baroque soloists ( philips , 1982 ) . but marriner my mind best , he blends both worlds : chamber choir orchestra , but modern instruments . recorded sound terrific : highest recommendation	1
it shame not many people know ten years after . i'm very thankful my father introducing me this band . alvin lee masterful guitarist , years ahead his time . songs cricklewood wonderfully written , track track great flow . buy this album if you're blues/rock fan , you won't dissapointed	1

" i don't hurt anymore " also favorite other recording artists . it testament appeal hank snow his songs . 1962 " i've everywhere " crossover hit . hank snow also made soulful rendition floyd tillman " i almost lost my mind " . there very little filler here nothing not like . i recommend it	-1
this very nice cd collection i enjoy very much . they original recordings so you aware couple older songs sound scratchy just like they when you put record record player . it shame they couldn't get crisper sound all new technology but it make you aware how sound quality improved over years . this would make great gift anyone over 50 . i put mine car just sing away before i know it i am my destination . this would great collection take trip .	-1
this cd great its powerful rock sound . lyrics sound great music awesome ! i love " cornerstone " , " fade away " , " rain song " , " jacob dream " . only thing could made this cd little better add couple more songs , total length cd only 35:51 , but i guess we'll just wait their next cd hear more . this cd real strong sound , though , just shouldn't missed	1

cinematic world would far more enjoyable place venture into if we more composers who could write film music like prokofiev could . his foray into movie world ( eisenstein films ivan terrible alexander nevsky ) must considered one pinnacles film music . cantata alexander nevsky built material film same name . unlike most film music it more than aptly suited survive its own , away screen . other two works this disc less than masterworks , but still very entertaining . scythian suite hardly prokofiev genius work . it written originally ballet ( direct competition stravinsky rite spring ) diaghilev , but rejected . he salvaged music made scythian suite , which very violent , primitive , brutal quite entertaining . lt . kije fun little piece , it romance particularily delightful . i think you would lot trouble finding better performance nevsky than this one , abbado talent it peak here , lso really belt out loud moments this music ( they very loud ) , without losing their clarity . short , nevsky kind music makes prokofiev one my all-time favorite composers	1

great compilation . i love it they all full length studio versions . also it great them chronological order great liner notes info each song . i wish they would left off 17 minute long " celebration lizard " -- this real dog . they could replaced this nearly 9 minute title song " soft parade " which incredible funky middle section . also could included " take it it comes " their first album - very overlooked song . this band 90-100 minutes classic stuff - best rock , really - but rest their material pretty marginal if not downright bad . so , all their best can't fit one cd , yet 2 cd can't help but contain little filler . i'd rather than just 1 cd . but it would nice remastered version " soft parade "	-1

maynard ferguson late 60 70 lps re-released cd rather haphazard way but least his most important lp period finally making it cd . if you maynard collector , you need this cd because it contains some key tracks helped revive maynard career early 70 . this cd consists music two different lp out four lp maynard recorded british columbia , largely british band , during 1968-72 , when he living uk . one lp included here first lp maynard recorded during his 4-year stint britain , called " ballad style maynard ferguson . " it recorded 1969 included this cd tracks 9 through 19 . second lp included this cd real gem here -- lp called " mf horn 2 , " it 4th lp maynard recorded british band ( recorded 1972 ) . " mf horn 2 " represented here tracks 1 through 8 . difference two pretty striking ( see comments below ) , you really mark resurgence maynard career noting difference two . now , schedule maynard lp re-releases gotten totally confusing . clear up early 70 chronology ( near i tell ) , order his lp their cd re-release status like this : - ballad style maynard ferguson ( included here)- mf horn ( now out cd - get it)- maynard ferguson ( now out cd - get it)- mf horn 2 ( included here)- mf horn 3 ( which released same british label this)- live jimmy , aka mf horn 4 5 ( which packaged mf horn 3 cd re-release . ) . - then finally " chameleon , " which out awhile cd ( get it ) . takes maynard up mid-70 , generally most his work after available some time . so , key tracks this cd -- " mf horn 2 " tracks 1 through 8 -- fall right middle maynard mid-career revival , indeed , required listening maynard devotees . they're representative his early 70 style -- mostly pop/rock standards day jazz/rock/pop hybrid style lot horns , lot bass , lots screamin ' soloing maynard . " give it one , " opener this cd , maynard classic , staple his live concerts 70 , " hey jude , " final cut mf horn 2 album . " spinning wheel " interesting arrangement pop classic ; " shaft " . so , any guesses why these two albums laid down this cd reverse chronological order ? i think it because 1969 ballad tracks such snoozers it would too jarring put them first cd . result , way this cd arranged , you 8 pretty lively tracks first then suddenly track 9 this cd falls into deep sleep that bit jarring . true , it great hear maynard cut loose some pop ballads ( esp . maria somewhere ) , his high-register playing , usual , completely amazing . but arrangements so sickly-sweet , song choice so dated , it really hard listen most ballad tracks more than once . it trumpet geeks only , i'm afraid , even them it hard slog sit through . net : - this not best place start early 70 maynard collection ( i would start w/ " maynard ferguson , " " chameleon , " or new " mf horn 3 " " live jimmy " two-cd set promised soon ) . - if you out get complete set maynard , course , you own mf horn 2 tracks , they worth price admission here . think this required purchase mf horn 2 other tracks thrown free . my final rating mix : kudos record company prying away rights columbia get this re-issued ; 10 stars some god-like trumpet playing ; 5 stars " give it one " alone ; some heavy penalty points some ballad tracks . finally : r.i.p. maynard -- great musician , great educator , great entertainer	-1

if you seen keller williams live , you probably loved him or hated him right away . i fell into prior group following him steady two years now . this new double live cd , stage , best representation date his live shows . loop , live cd released 2001 , also very good disc which i highly recommend anyone , stage carries torch this album reflecting his more recent escapades stage . there more instruments used this album ( read my loop review more info his one man band angle ) create much more complete sound . some cover songs stage make you laugh out loud or very least guffaw slightly . i especially enjoyed his version rapper delight , which i saw him perform live barely recognizable original . all all , this great cd if you into improvisational live music , i've said before , if you can't see him live , this next best thing ( but not nearly good person , check him live !	-1
i bought this album because five years ago i spent four months cairo , egypt , every time i got into taxi , there 50/50 chance i would hear " amarain . " it catchy song , got stuck my head , despite fact i only understood one word out every five . i decided buy album titled " amarain " check out rest amr diab music . i fell love " ana , " which also single off album . " ana " combines egyptian pop sound latino rhythms vaguely techno riff . it also call-and-response driving beat . all all , great song . rest album very listenable too . so , i came back us , lost tape , much my chagrin . this year , i wandering around amazon.com, found greatest hits . it " amarain " " ana " it , so i decided get it . nearly every song very good , all good . few pre-packaged " listen this unspecific world music while selling cars or ' ethnic ' food " feel , but they're still catchy . my husband , who only understands five ( or so ) words arabic , enjoys insistent beat amr diab . you chill it , you dance it , you attempt read rather badly translated english lyrics , or you just put it car drive it	-1
i'll start off thing get me unhelpful votes , but it needs said . i've heard very few songs kmfdm so my introduction lucia came form revolver magazine . without ever truly hearing her voice i decided get land volcanos . nearly month ago this cd still heavy rotation . this one those cds escape . 54 some odd second running time , you're completely different place . lucia voice lush melodies sweep over you you lose all sense time . few cds so find one it , so successfully , quite relief . whether song harder variety or just relaxing , no point this record stall , it moves swiftly , which , ironically , my only gripe it well . very beginning so clever i figured i quite ride . so clever just solid song , nothing more . breathy vocals through verses turn into ear catching chorus . i don't care some best lyrics disc , plus chorus pretty much soars . fear lyrically driven song . it serves true highlight well . feels like summer probably my second favorite featured . ' instant classic ' comes mind whenever i hear it . pulsating beat some pretty intense moments only serve song more justice . what you become nin feel it repetative chorus , not my favorite but good few listens . who asked you creeps certain sensuality it . i goes down my favorite song featured . chorus irresistable , that basically what it boils down . monkey puzzle tree kind grated my nerves first but now i really like it . nice lyrics excellent chorus . ordinary girl rounds out true cd nicely . chorus kind eery due completely lucia vocals . i love pace this song . kmfdm verson monkey puzzle tree strikes me more reprise than remix . either way , it still great song . my favorite songs so clever , fear , feels like summer , i , ordinary girl . if you're like me haven't properly introduced lucia , well this perfect way . this cd truly amazing i only hope when i venture into kmfdm catalog they'll impress me much lucia land volcanos	1

after 14 years apart eagles got back together 1994 record 4 new tracks perform concert tv special . " hell freezes over " result this project my opinion this must own any fan eagles . 3 4 new songs great ones . don henley " get over it " great rocker pretty much sums up my philosophy life . tim schmit " love keep us alive " rather average song , but it brought higher level schmit unique vocal style . no one cans sing songs like this quite like him . glenn frey " girl yesterday " harkens back bands early country rock roots , good tune great lyrics . other new track " learn still " henley not lot me . live section album solid start finish . fact i would say this material blows " eagles live " album 1980 out water . recording pristine performances just perfect . band all acoustic version hotel california incorporates nice twist original song . my all time favorite eagles song " last resort " majestic even better than studio version , serves crowning moment album . " tequila sunrise " , " wasted time " , " pretty maids all row " , " i can't tell you why " , " take it easy " , " city " , " life fast lane " , " desperado " all appear here all sound great . don henley solo hit " new york minute " also included . this album would serve fine introduction anyone looking explore eagles . it also proved band back big way . they continued tour fairly regular basis ever since	1

itunes great tool , isn't it ? now , even tho i'm hella asian , i don't know anything computers technology all jazz . i know i like certain songs artists what not . so , i pretty much no life , although when i spell it out it doesn't seem all unusual . i'm 25 year old bartender who sits computer plays online poker his spare time . could easily describe 2 million people . but when i'm pokered out ( or when i'm flat broke pokering around ) i go amazon read people reviews , then go limewire get songs based reviews . i must this 20 hours week . i work 40 , play poker 40 , sleep 60 , this 20 . i told you i no life . when i made my profile 5 or 6 years ago , i prompted put down profession like teacher , or student , or whatever , i said " music my life , default " , statement still holds true today . why am i going this long winded narrative my life , or lack thereof ? i'm not sure , i just want stress i'm music lover , i love caia . so itunes , it keeps track what songs i play . weekend players number one , aquanote not far behind . but i've those guys lot longer than caia , caia proudly number 3 right now . reason i'm writing this review because i've " remembrance " repeat 50 minutes now . i just share how good this song album people who might care . there no other song my vast itunes library i would put repeat , let alone 8 times . if you're like me , who likes browse download based reviews , get caia " remembrance " . it not everyone , but you'll glad you're not one them . there other delicious songs here well , i'm sure like everyone else , i went through phase where i liked " rose room " best , or subway song , or " summer lightning " . it really doesn't matter anyways , everyone their own tastes . i'm just saying , right now , music junkie no other life , i love this album best . maybe i'm not willing yet put it ahead ok computer radiohead yet , but it same discussion . i never thought i would say this because ok computer well , ok computer . just check it out , ok	1

ventures greatest rock instrumental band ever . i would even go length say they best rock group , period , but that little too extreme many people . ventures formed late 1959 . future guitarists band , don wilson , bob bogle , new each other through their jobs , used car lot . after they got together , walk dont run came . after couple singles , album , walk dont run shot up charts , ventures surf rock legends ! few albums later , few changes lineup , 1963 , ventures consisted don wilson , nokie edwards , bob bogle , guitars , mel taylor drums . what group extraudinary musicians ! group could tackle so many musical styles . what ease feel they it . during 1960 , ventures put out great albums , some great hit singles . they would record their most famous song ever , " hawaii five-0 . " though it would their most famous song , most not know same group who put out walk don run 10 years earlier , put out this gem . this cd collection , captures ventures their prime . it also some rarities like radio show commercials breif interview " rocketing rhythms , " don wilson bob bogle . this nice place start , ventures . i two years ago , now , i'm hooked . i also learned little guitar them . this nice collection . if you're avad guitar fan , instrumental rock fan , surf rock fan , oldies fan , or just fan great music , this cd . you won't dissapointed	1
this true defining moment 80s apropos summary decade . this album came out 1989 , after motley crue , ratt , white lion , journey , all others made their mark . truth this album tried save genre album oriented rock ( find bad song it you'll thousand people telling you you're crazy ) , tried save glam metal ( although they weren't exactly trying get cover rock magazine every other week like motley crue ) look matched sound . this good rock . you would hard pressed find album 1989 influenced many , sold many , or played much ( radio , home stereos , car stereos , etc ) than this	1

this remixed stereo version who debut album simply vast improvement ; especially soundwise , compared my old mgm version , which i always found annoyingly dull . here you'll hear sounds parts you never even knew there . crunchier guitar-sounds clearer vocals . few tracks misses some parts recorded directly into original mono-tapes - that why some original mono-versions inluded disc two . " my generation " without lead-guitar feels little fla t.t hough pete townshend obviously hasn't reached his heights songwriter this point , his original songs outshine cover-versions miles . pop-rock anthems like " kids alright " " my generation " course classics , " i can't explain " , their first hit , benefitted enormously remastering - great track . album tracks like " good gone " , " la la la lies " , " it not true " , " legal matter " " circles " document great versatility townshend songwriting . it no surprise who great musicians too - listen enthwistle " ox " - like many other tracks featuring legendary piano-player nicky hopkins . among bonus-tracks you'll find all early b-sides alternate versions various songs . i especially thrilled " instant party mixture " , which way also predicts " sell out " theme . when i sometimes forget how good they really - this album remind me . fine booklet lots information written mike shaw , shel talmy andy neill	1

back 1987 , while just every new band all fit into one category , lacked originality all sounded similar . comes faster pussycat proud doing their own thing , playing wide variety styles didn't care what anybody thought . meaning they mixed sleaze , glam , rock , blues together , avoided pop-metal added humor their songwriting . they closer aerosmith/rolling stones sound than they given credit . also give me break they just ripped off guns roses , poison , etc . both these bands stole so much other bands without putting their own stamp their music . axl stole so much steve tyler it not even funny brett not same league taime . least faster pussycat they put their own sound their influences made music fun their humor filled songs . also they something neither guns posers or pop poison could . that release album 10 great songs it no fillers . each track this debut release really awesome . only pussycat could pull it off such songs , " bathroom wall " , " no room emotion " , " cathouse " , " bottle front me " . just too name few . must release you love pussycat . it bummer they where underrated never got credit they deserve . lastly , based music scene today . pussycat would fit right would huge	1
cameroonian musician richard bona made quite winning disc multi-cultural music tied together his ebullient singing , creatively layered arrangements jazz-infused rhythmic chops . he composed all songs except one , varied lot , performs his native tongue , douala , which one two hundred cameroonian dialects . he makes music truly world view , but never he sound contrived due consistency his sound his production craftsmanship . instance , there elements strong brazilian influence , particular , high-energy samba , " manyaka o brazil " , which manages make marc berthoumieux accordion sound seductive , ipanema-like " cal�ad�o de copacabana " . john legend joins bona opening track , loping " please don't stop " , which sounds like throwback 1970's-style rb shuffle especially atn stadwijk supple horn arrangement . dream-like " o beta o siba " jazz-lounge , vince guaraldi-like sound " esoku bulu " ( " night whisper " ) make nice contrasts predominantly rhythmic orientation disc . distinctive african beats pervasive throughout title track , which effectively sauntering vocal turn susheela raman , drum-heavy " akwa samba yaya " . " ba senge " catchy , keyboard-based beat reminiscent doobie brothers circa 1979 , while buena vista social club appears inspiration percolating " o sen sen sen " , which driven osmany paredes ' havana-style piano playing . there couple brief lovely acoustic ballads , pian o-o riented " kivu " ending " nu sango " . surprisingly moving track bona almost classical-sounding cover jaco pastorius ' " three women " moving string arrangement . strings play predominant part my favorite track , " samaouma " its rich multi-cultural sound brought life bona hypnotic vocals , pat metheny-like fret work lush strings courtesy flux quartet . variety sounds this recording quite impressive considering bona plays multitude instruments all songs . his dexterous fluent ability open himself up global scene hopefully bring him stateside success	-1
velvet underground , me , rock - or specifically indie/alternative rock - all time greatest band because it its most influential . list bands musicians influenced inspired vu enormous includes u2 , cure , strokes , rem , luna , jesus mary chain , patti smith , name just few . i am proud owner their boxed set , peel slowly see which one few boxed sets i own . i also own some solo records various velvets , including lou reed , nico , john cale . i brought my friends see film " i shot andy warhol , " which reconstructed era warhol factory , when velvets ( well played film yo la tengo ) house band . i now own copy fine film , well . even though i born 1961 , thus bit too young known understood warhol factory era , i remember tail end 60s . i remember greenwich village lower manhattan back then . i aunt who loved city who used take me over there , our nj home , regular basis i specific memories witnessing 60s freaks washington square park . i must six years old time . i got older , i came realization significance 60s , warhol , greenwich village , seminal band connected all three : lou reed , john cale , mo tucker , sterling morrison - velvet underground . i bought rather old , scratchy copy this record , which i found used record bin , while high school mid/late 1970s , which also period time when i , influenced 70s rock mags like creem circus , began discover music lou reed ( e.g. , coney island baby , transformer , street hassle , etc ) . however , i didn't truly get deeply into lou velvets until bit later , when i bought velvet compilation , began listening them , well various velvets solo stuff more frequently carefully . nevertheless , first listened this record its classic proto noise/no wave track sister ray , when i , planted seed . i recall liking few songs here - title track , sister ray , here she comes now , not quite knowing what make rest , particularly john cale nihilistic little story song gift or lou freakout guitar solo i heard her call my name . i also less than impressed cruddy production values recording , made worse my scratchy used copy . listening now , thinking it further , i now realize what gem even scratchy used copy this . this , indeed , great album , truly classic . this mainly lou album , it , you hear him asserting himself band leader . you also hear band pushing him back . listening whole band thrash away sister ray - its deviantly awkward , erotically charged lyrics -one hears what rock drone meant . short , lo-fi production inherent tensions within band made proto-punk , proto-indie rock classic recording , one which truly captures anomic polarized mood late 60s , time drugs , violence , political confrontation , social artistic change . whole world turned upside down , velvet underground managed capture small piece tenor times . this recording belongs music collection everyone interested history rock , punk , indie rock or warholiana .	1
although seduction always my all-time favorite boney , sweet thing/it all good great work . east bay wonderful groove sets tone rest tracks . but sweet thing my cut this cd . i got opportunity hear him play song live oh , my word !! buy it yourself . listen it . you'll find yourself coming back it .	-1
i waited almost 30 years buy this album . i knew " give me love " course . but when i bought listened it first time , i struck how familiar entire album sounded . i'll bet pre-vanilla world fm radio 1973 , i may heard all tracks , somewhere my memory these songs got locked away . but - good music always strange quality familiarity . you feel you heard it before . george harrison write great hook , material world he mines his imagination sounds we may recall beatles days - rhythm guitar riff " lord loves one " , instance , which harks back intro " old brown shoe " . george tips his hat beatles throughout this album . you get sense huge impact he their sound . but he also steps out here entire album his own way . he still presenting catalogue songs conceived while fabs still together . it like " all things must pass " , part ii , not disappoint . quiet beatle , indeed , lot say . we hear lot george vanishing creativity 70s waned . i would counter , say george harrison may acquired taste some . repeated listens , his vision message begin materialize over time . his profound sense unusual chord progressions yields beautiful sound uniquely his . george harrison impart positive message using darkest sounds , which almost exact opposite what paul mccartney his music . it may sad lennon mccartney split up - but harrison brought lot table . lennon his anger irony ; mccartney his soaring musical vision joy ; but harrison his optimism mixed sadness . " all " rivals " something " , but some reason not released single below radar screen decades . this one my favorite harrison cds . it true solo album , which he not run away his status ex-beatle . olivia dhani harrison given us concert george , set remasterings . it time them get into early capitol albums , starting this one - make even better , this excellent music . i wonder what bonus tracks floating around	1

some grading this collection down because it contains relatively few tracks comparison other quot ; hitsquot ; compilations . frankly , kitchen sink approach chronicling band progression overkill . unless one absolutely smitten particular artist , eleven tracks probably plenty . selections here appropriate , some pre-lionel-as-sensitive-frontman gems like quot ; brick housequot ; , well accomplished balladry followed . whomever arranged sequencing this cd bit jokester : quot ; three times ladyquot ; , baroque beautiful wedding-reception standard , followed quot ; sail onquot ; , overt kiss-off . regardless , remastering top-notch ; listen this headphones you sometimes hear band members breathing . casual commodores fans probably find eleven solid songs quite enough , although they might choose skip back quot ; brick housequot ; few times ; it may tightest 70s anthem booty ever recorded	-1
those who purchased this cd some questions it , i would like fill details you . back summer 2005 i contacted cherry red , asking if they any plans release artery material they held rights . this included few singles , part ' oceans ' mini lp , ' one afternoon hot air balloon ' lp . they said they no current plans , but asked if i would like assist putting together compilation ? i gladly agreed . i doing sound restoration many years , i wanted directly involved aspect cd . they informed me what songs they could use without incurring additional licensing fees , so material i could work . cherry red pulled out tapes they storage , flat transfer them cd sent them me . i allowed select songs put them order my choice . i spent good bit time remastering material . i evened balances , adjusted volumes , removed some static pops within songs some careful hiss reduction . addition , tape one song could not found , three others poorly deteriorated over time . i managed save one those songs re-equalizing damaged channel others i remastered , skill , vinyl . you tell which ones they ? 19 songs i choose , only one i chose leave off 12 " version " alabama song " . 7 " far superior , though it still not one their best releases . cd also included couple unreleased songs found one master tapes . those songs , " africa " fully produced song i found quite interesting . jungle drumming shouting gave it sort adam ants feel . unreleased version " slide " later revealed me one band members joke track never meant released . not known advance , i included it because other versions " slide " could not included due licensing . like many compilation albums , material vary group explores different musical territory . this no exception . early songs like classic " into garden " " clown " quite different what appeared ' one afternoon hot air baloon ' lp but that what compilations all - diversity . i suppose i could ' balloon ' released its standard running order additional songs included bonuses , though i opted scattered compilation approach . i put my opinion stronger songs towards beginning , ending weaker remixes/alternate versions . i also provided front cover art all scans booklet . cherry red none single/album sleeves handy so i gladly scanned emailed them . i based design front cover ' oceans ' mini lp , quite pleased results . cover showing up many these online websites original , untouched rough draft i provided , which before last minute name change some correction curtains . i also proofed liner notes provided major overhaul discography . finally , i provided song detail paragraph page one . i spent many months working couple other great people get this cd become reality . i'm very proud results hope others enjoy it well - it long overdue . said , i also enjoy new artery compilation simon hinkler worked spinney label , which actually titled ' afterwards ' . it focuses earlier artery material , including much stuff i unable use . there only one song/version cd overlaps this one , making it essential buy artery fans . though final artery recordings not good earlier material , it would nice eventually see compilation focusing 84-85 material well	1

" soundtrack my inner life " sounds corny , but just what this music my last 35 years . i no hesitation calling this rock ' roll because its high volume , distortion , relentless beat . yet simple , even crude melodic structures allow players room weave writhe amazing directions . band improbable collection eccentrics , yet miles fused them . only he could lead furious interplay one hears keith jarrett john mclaughlin , or mike henderson , jack dejohnette airto moriera . there no missing angry , aggressive mood much work , yet there deep optimism beneath it . i always felt miles wanted not just lead us new kind music but new way living -- way involves asking new questions passing up old answers . like so many other early ' 70s musicians , miles trying shock us inspiration create better world . i think live/evil still 2006	1
