maybe i'm daft , but i can't make decent espresso these pods my machine . i've tried tamping them , which doesn't work well i've tried just placing them filter . both cases i get watery dribble but no espresso . other european products ( think ikea ) there no printed instructions english , just line art drawings . perhaps i'm just doing something wrong . i like concept pods , but i'll stick beans instead	-1

i am really disappointed this beand they marketing this kids . 4% iron no other vitamins ?? childhood obesity epidemic proportions , why would anyone feed their children all these empty calories ?? it like giving them coke or pepsi breakfast !! ok organic coke but still coke !! i am sad because i heard great things this brand really like what they doing endangered species !! but they not thinking their target consumer children	-1
i ordered teriyaki , original black pepper flavored ones . other two flovors quite good but this one , teriyaki , really sub-standard . it sandy texture quality very uneven compared others .	-1
i'm sorry give this poor review , but tea taste good order me drink it . i often drink large variety bedtime teas never tasted any tea this awful . i can't speak how well it works because i couldn't drink whole cup even though i attempted force myself . yogi makes some good teas , but this i just couldn't stomach .	-1

ok so pretzels supposed salty , but these tad too salty . they also burnt flavor . you could say this distinctive smokey flavor , but 12 bags ahead you prospects unsatisfied pallett mighty tall order . other hand subtle sweet flavors good . this not your ordinary pretzel try them safety first ( instead buying 12 bags ) . also note grocery items cannot returned amazon	-1
there no doubt this tea it job , but smell it awful . i normally don't any problems eating or drinking mildly offensive things , but i such aversion smell this tea . it top note moldy , dank earth base note acrid peppers gone bad . box says it contains " delicious sasparilla " . i don't taste anything like sasparilla or rootbeer it all . if you bear smell aftertaste then go it	-1

flavored coffee creamers guilty pleasure mine long time now , but even if you buy sugar-free kind , you're ingesting whopping 1 gram fat per tablespoon creamer . if weren't bad enough , it partially hydrogenated ! splenda flavor blends wonderful alternative if you're like me just can't face black coffee . please note this not creamer . it sweetens/flavors coffee . if you find you just creamer " tame " down your coffee you add splenda flavor blend splash skim milk or if you like things more creamy , buy some powdered non-fat milk add splenda flavor blends . lots times , i find products splenda already them too sweet but i didn't think case this . all three available flavors ( hazelnut , mocha , vanilla ) taste great without overpowering . finally , now i kick fatty creamer bad habit !	1
i not like store-bought cookies , especially oreos ( too dry greasy me ) . but upon recommendation several people , i tried ginger o pleasantly surprised . they excellent flavor cream not greasiness it . if you like ginger cookies , don't hesitate try these	1

i use cups all time- work , home , etc . there handful good cup brands out there . this one best . both decaf regular timothy columbian smooth rich flavor . add some creamer sweetener , goodbye any other coffee !! you won't disappointed . believe it or not , home brewing cup machine(keurig ) gives better cup coffee versus commercial cup machine(also keurig ) , because hot water not blast too quickly through it . fyi	1
this * awesome * soup !! i little iffy it ( any soup coming or bag ! ) but ordered it anyway , it sounded so good . my hubby , toddler i * love * it could eat it every week if we more money buy it ! we took some camping trip shared all our friends we , everyone agreed how great it . not good home-made , but really really good ! i'm not sure taste buds reviewer gave it 1 star , but we all thought it worth getting again ..!	1
great flavor , light fluffy , good texture . only down side bread tends dissolve much moisture , tendency little dry but great sandwiches . unlike other gluten-free breads tend so heavy they over power anything you put middle .	-1

i disagree other review this tea unbearable scent . i would say jasmine scent strong , but not overpoweringly so . if you brew it according producer recommendation ( steep it 60-90 seconds ) , result good great . tea very soothing jasmine taste very comforting . only knock perhaps it leaves little bit aftertaste , especially when tea cold . i not understand other reviewer fascination packaging , bag tea bag tea bag tea . who really cares what printed tab ? anyways , i drinking this tea daily i am ready shop when this one runs out . recommended : people looking decent tasting white tea . not recommended : people particularly sensitive scent taste jasmine .	-1
these wonderful cookies ! however , reason i couldn't give full 5 stars because so many boxes case lot crumbled cookies . boxes not damaged any way , so i am guessing they could packaged way . not cool ! otherwise , they much better tasting than oreos my opinion . i'll never go back those	-1
my family my healthfood store lady all say this one best betty lou nut butter balls . i not any problems all taste , fact , it beats heck out coconut ones which extremely sweet . yes , they look green middle , but we found taste rather " clean " refreshing ... not overbearing . you also enjoy " lift " your energy level these spirulina/ginseng balls provide . now i know these little guys , i am getting ready buy tons christmas gifts ! we would not without them anymore . : -	1

this great granola both nutritious delicious . although it called " cranberry pecan , " i find pecan taste predominate mix , while cranberries quite chewy weaker than some other cereals . this traditional cereal , great way start day . it relatively high calories , but appropriate breakfast suggested quantities . texture very crunchy , while i prefer bear naked texture which softer , this still wonderful product . six-pack cereal very reasonably priced , given quality product excellent value . i recommend this cereal anyone , especially people who love pecans	1
this granola very good - it very chewy .... takes long time chew - dried cranberries very chewy . i think it would taste great salad or mixed other cereal . i wonder if cooking it like hot oatmeal would soften it .	-1

i really got hooked great taste superior creama it produces , but i find it bit overpriced compared other pods . i now buy pods boyd coffee substantial savings . wish amazon would put it sale so i could stock up	1
yes , these pods slightly larger than regular ones , but you make two cups ( 2x4oz or 1x8oz ) out 1 pod price right . i use 1-cup insert , squeeze pod little so coffee gets loose inside , when i close senseo lid , i push lever lid same time	1

earl grey my favorite blend tea far - no competition there . biggest secret this tea once given earl grey hoswick hall ( british prime minister 1830 - 1834 ) chinese manadarin , reportedly gratitude after earl saved his life , get just right doseage bergamot oil , rather intense , tangy scent derived bergamot orange ( which turn cross pear lemon sour orange ; latter native south vietnam , its oil probably recipe original ingredient ) . using too much bergamot oil easily obscure black tea natural flavor - but twinings you just can't go wrong , because original earl grey turned this very company match quickly dwindling supply he received his chinese friend . ( twinings website : " when mandarin tasty gift began run out , earl grey asked his tea merchants , twinings , match it him . twinings unique blend grey family long-standing favourite . when guests inquired it , they directed twinings strand , where they would ask earl grey tea name . " ) unless you insist * all * your tea cream or milk , i recommend this one without any kind milk products : not only original recipe not call such addition ; my mind it just plain ruins blend particular flavor . ( but that just me , course . ) whichever way you it , though , if scented teas your kind thing , twinings earl grey should right up your alley	1

i love original vanilla creme newman o , so when i saw wheat-free/dairy-free sale one day i picked one up . i figured it would basically same original . chocolate vanilla tastes great , but i found cookies themselves rock hard . so unless you issue wheat or dairy products , i would recommend original vanilla creme , not wheat-free/dairy-free variety	-1
these greatest . light , not too sweet , delicious . high fiber . who could ask anything more ? problem , amazon seems always limited stock so they go fast . they should even out supply : demand ratio also offer other 2 flavors more regular basis	1
