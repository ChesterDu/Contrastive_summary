afi used pretty good band . then , they decided go emo-girlie-boy . lead singer made adramatic change smelly-goth-dude perfect-manicured-emo-girl/guy . what happened smeely-goth-dude ? some us actually like music , not " emoness " . not only , but " miss murder " waaaaay overplayed , now it encrested into my brain . i mean , come , it not even good song . afi looking appeal mainstream . there nothing wrong , if you keep your old sound , which this band failed . this , my friends , afi worst album , if not hte worst album 2006 . check out older afi stuff . " sing sorrow " okay , but if you want truley good music , you go back into their ninties albums	-1
i am 23 yr old mother 2 1/2 yr old . not only these children horrible singers , but there reason most parents don't let their children listen original songs ... they teach them things they don't need know . i thought this would " kids " version would get rid stuff when i let child i babysitting put cd ... appalled how much they talked sex other innappropriate things children . they didn't take out ! children exposed every day our world now , telling them it " normal " " ok " . parents big enough job teach their children right wrong way world today . it becomes much harder job when you give them something " kids " teaches them those things " normal " . they assume if it ok kids cd , it can't bad . i think this horrible would never spend penny it child ! some songs i like originial version listen , this cd ruined them ! but when it comes children who too young understand it just song doesn't mean what they say ok ... i think it worst thing you could buy your child	-1
i anxious hear astounding modern yet retro dance disc one my favorite girl groups 80s . unfortunately , instead picking up latest influence 80s music dance music , what we get here predominantly disco flavored tracks sound painfully dated , some latin tones now then . only semi retro/electro tracks here ( my favorites ) feel you , love bite , your love like drug , marc almond remix venus . two lead singles " move my direction " " look floor " not even strongest tracks ! remixes their singles don't make them much better . i appreciate commercial direction girls taken , but you still sound mainstream while more sophisticated than this . take listen new madonna or even kelly osbourne (!) hear some infectious melodies 80s flair don't melt down into total cheese . unfortunately , i just don't see us radio embracing any sounds this disc . but course , fans bananarama should still add this one their collection . it listenable , if not up today standards	-1
listening this cd took me back my growing-up years . i remembered all their songs i loved back then . it great homecoming	-1
although real roots lie black artists who inspired these guys , pbbb where hippy generation , ( this couple years pre-san francisco , before stones beatles began stretching their arrangements out record ) , learned just play . their next record more representative what they actually doing live time time , single greatest influence what became san francisco sound late 60 early 70 , ( really long experimental jamming ) , so this fact quot ; roots roots rootsquot ; todays jam bands guitar-heavy blues bands , mixed-race bands , , all practical purposes , white-blues-man todays ' world	1
when young artist names her first two albums not quot ; judyquot ; or quot ; collinsquot ; but quot ; maid constant sorrowquot ; quot ; golden apples sunquot ; , you know she takes herself seriously . originaly released 1961 . 1962 . their names all i knew until i saw this cd recently . quot ; who buy this ? quot ; i wondered just see only copy snatched right front me . comparisons first two baez albums inevitable ( some songs recorded both ) althought collins shows much more passion involment where baez seemingly seduces herself beauty her voice . these early albums collins frighteningly devoted keeper flame her repertoire almost exclusively traditional - which means not only ethereal beauty but also certain ( some ears , overpowering ) seriousness , cleverly mellowed inclusion joyous quot ;o daddy gayquot ; , cousin her quot ; grandfatherquot ; recorded years later . althought i honestly love these songs listen only this cd days , these early albums today much more significant seeds collins later trademarks ( voice soar much higher future , she slipped . . yeats into traditional folk collection just later blossom into first-rate art-pop singer ) they product their greenwich village times , they may sound bit dated some modern ears . but they still hauntingly beautiful me , i waited their re-release too long	1
those who watched movie jaws ( ask yourself , who hasn't ) know one many key elements made movie huge success fantastic score john williams it . this cd captures all music movie perfectly , some new elements thrown not found film . linear notes bright colourful provide some interesting information , which gives overall package nice touch . overall cd package certainly not rushed effort worth every cent . highly recommended purchase those who love their soundtracks or anyone who wants relive film through music	1
johnny truly rising star . i saw him live " accident " very happy i introduced his music . he still relatively unknown , unfortunately . he seems quite popular boston , where he originally , but even here nj , i haven't heard his music played radio yet . he deserves more than this . there way too much crappy music around that polluting our radios which almost makes it crime not give this guy sort fame he deserves his work . fact you over 40 reviews his cd most them give 5 stars certainly says something how solid , original , creative , high-quality his music . truly work art . he stands right up there many guitar greats like srv , bb king , albert king , eric clapton , others . however , contrast these guys , johnny cds all instrumentals , fact he able capture sort attention admiration he guitar instumental work both noteworthy testament his talent creativity both songwriter guitar player . his style extremely diverse , i amazed how many different tones sounds he able extract one custom-made johnny signature gibson guitar . i mean , wow . after listening this cd his other new cd , try see him live , you not sorry . johnny simply gem , i really hope his career flourishes sort fame wide recognition he deserves	1
i expecting ( er , hoping ) something closer " hounds love , " but this spacey unspooled . i appreciate change i appreciate disjointed ethereal songwriting , but this bit much me . some songs seem just spin off into nothingness , others drag . few songs much triter lyrics than i expected her , most her voice seems rambling while disregarding music behind it . i liked one or two tracks , but overall i cannot get into this	-1

well , yes , i one those kids who took tap dancing ballroom dancing lessons mostly due fred ginger movies keeping my twin brother i out mischief . but now this extraordinary double cd set ! first , there lot charming music this collection which excellent sound quality . songs include not just singing parts but also dancing parts . so , you visualize duo dancing while your eyes closed just listening . plenty excellent music included . all big hits . there also nice booklet included plenty info songs , movies fred ginger . there also plentiful " behind scenes " pictures . so ok , song " piccolino " not included this set . it just rhino records could not buy rights song " fair " price ( rhino opinion ) . but , since overall double cd set just so wonderfully put together , you don't even really notice it , folks . this real treasure song , dance memories taking you back time when only things seemed " dirty " your knees you trying dance like fred astaire . overall rating :	1
truly one great live albums all time . advice other reviewers dead : buy either two cd complete budokan or this budokan ii ( if you find it ) you not sorry . this masterpiece belongs right up there who live leeds rolling stones ' get yer ya ya out .	1
loved cd . hard believe etta james teenager when she recorded these songs . her voice flawless . i am new fan	1
feinstein love gershwins passion never made clearer than pure gershwin . michael love affair ira lyrics , his reckless abandon light-hearted spirit familiar -- lesser known -- phrases , more than makes up less polished vocal production this early album . fact , it very element sells these songs i've never heard them elsewhere . michael pulls out all stops , embracing less-than-lily-white additional verses quot ; embraceable youquot ; , unbridled passion first time lover . his duet rosie clooney arrouses my curiosity movie which this unknown number made its debut . what delightful approach michael demonstrates throughout .... oh , young exuberant life , love music again	1
its best good stuff , it even kenshin song i like so much	1
dirty mind , without doubt , best album little guy ever put out . 40 minute tour de force , uneducated elitist it sounds like mess shallow lyrics casio keyboard demos . however , open your heart album you'll soon grow love it wonder why prince doesn't sing falsetto more . it interesting once most accessible danceable albums i've ever heard fact ode perversion just general sketchiness . song topics relations his sister coercing virgin her wedding day fellatio , prince full horn dog mode here , folks . however , album seems harness power raging sexuality put it beat , creating music would guilty pleasure if it weren't so darn good . instantly shifting into gear , album starts title track , robotic funk workout might greatest song prince ever recorded , if you ask me . slowly building upon itself , song develops into layers layers pounding synthesizer beats , prince crooning every note his highest voice possible . two other highlights album ' head ' ' when you mine ' , former infectious disco funk beat , latter new wave/bubblegum rocker . prince production values grew his fanbase , he probably never record anything else like dirty mind . almost brilliant it minimalist nature , album stripped down nature no popoular musician would guts make today . short , yet sweet collection 8 songs , it essential any fan prince , nay , fan contemporary music general it their collection	1
original version this album great . remastered additional tracks , this moves into super-greatness . opening track , very end it doesn't disappoint . buy this now .	1
this cd okay first few times you listen it , but it grate you 5th time . some songs sound hillibilly twangy , sing topics not special interest kids , don't rhyme or catchy , don't teach anything	-1
i suprised when i copped this record . last two de la albums all right but this one kills em . de la back	1
edition i simply titled " live budokan " , which german/uk budget import superior/digimode . course , this stands out because greg lake brief stint here , you two-thirds elp ( yet around same time emerson lake album late cozy powell instead carl palmer , then 3 emerson palmer but not lake ) . i liked lake king crimson their first album , but i couldn't take elp . it almost unusual hear him these songs . it would've made little sense throw " lucky man " maybe even " pictures exhibition " good measure , if you're elp fan , but what would yes half think ?. i too young remember concert , yet it watershed event . asia almost many lineup changes crimson , yes , destiny child ! this rare gem , even if you only like one previous band or other	1
jane horrocks unbelievable acting vocal talent . if you've seen little voice , you know she also exceptional mimick . this c.d. furthur exhibits her mimicking talents . she sings carol channing , ethel merman , even frank sinatra ( his classic it very good year ) , every song leaves you astonished leaning over press play button again your c.d. player	1
slow train album may hard some dylan fans get into , because its christian nature . i'm not born again christian , not even very good church goer , so longest time i didn't pay this record any attention . i got giant hybrid box set . however , there couple songs , " i believe you " " precious angel " where it possible me believe dylan singing or girl than deity . however , now , i must confess , i play whole cd , start finish , music just so good , dylan voice too . it convert me ? probably not , but it still awfully good music	1
stooges may most amateur band grace rock-and-roll . unit dances line immaturity passionate recklessness , no one cannot like their maudlin , silly feel . rumor it , when they started club scene , they could barely play their respective instruments , this " let just get it " sensibility most apparent music gray area these clumsy , yet brilliantly un-hinged sound , driven fuzzy guitar aggression , lyrics shouted iggy stooge ( who would later become punk icon , iggy pop ) attitude sing/speak glee . appropriate year 1969 , " stooges " released this debut self-titled album , getting audiences gasp their sex-and-drugs themed messages their brand early punk rock music . their manner arresting bleak angst-ridden outlook this vietnam war age , tone similar " doors , " " stooges " opened floodgates announce national college student confusion aggression those power . this proto-punk album ( proto punk = punk rock before there such term ) stepping-stone appointing them sort demi-gods all those interested hard rock , thus proves rock-and-roll not anything more than fun time , truly rock ... hard . stooges played hard , fast , loud , snooty , certainly abrasive their attack audience ; there certain honesty sound , immense bravery makes them stand out era , which many other bands would also influence punk rock , bigger foot rhythm blues genre . iggy simplistic , non-literate , yet effective lyrics glint rambunctious quality , definitive rebellion against " proper society . " what makes their music so fascinating this band obviously plays their heart out , their sex-and-drugs lyrics say what they mean say , unlike beatles velvet underground , their themes apparent , not submerged metaphors , they actually balls come out say , " i wanna you dog ! " since , such songs this , music lyrics so aggressive , this case sexually aggressive , it reminds listener time when your teenage years supposed so simple , yet ironically so complex . this song , particular , one finest punk songs all time ; it angular , but punishes you , if revving chainsaw full-tilt boogie , through these raunchy lyrics , threatening beat , almost porno-film instrumentals , truly show iggy means what he says . music isn't some sort sell-out truism , but rather reflection his life , no matter how unrefined , or even how silly it sounds , there " soul " here . great number songs ' titles feel like they picked high-school student , or rather dropout ; titles like , " no fun , " " real cool time , " not right , " it shows outright there not some high-concepted art here , but rather stooges party band highest order . so , exception dull , horrid , " we fall , " undoubtedly worst song their canon , even lesser extent , " ann , " songs here punch-and-crunch into your jugular , reside your soul until kid you dies . you love " stooges " -- so , listen it good hard , fast slow , because even if they probably not really intend revolutionary , they instead showed best kind music just played fun heart , simply because they love what they . so , long live brilliant dopes , stooges . **** ( out 5	1

following their successful first recording collaboration blue night records -- " angel eyes , " jazz mandolinist don stiernberg jazz guitarist john carlini it again " george " -- wonderful collection gershwin tunes . they angel eyes , stiernberg carlini once again employ bassist jim cox drummer phil gratteau make tight , swingin ' acoustic quartet some very tasty stuff some old gershwin chestnuts . cool thing their latest effort while they've covered some very familiar material , they've also interpreted some gershwin standards some pretty hip ways . i won't give away any surprises except say , example , i blown away their samba-ized version embraceable you . nicely , gents ! if you're into work acoustic jazz duos like django reinhardt stephane grappelli , joe venuti eddie lang , jazz instrumentals homer jethro , etc ., then " george " treat you shouldn't miss	1
this cd worst " comedy " cd i ever heard . yet reviews here mostly claim it hilarious ???? ok , i've come conclusion , only people writing positive reviews amazon must people trying sell junk . i've seen this guy some tv shows , comedy central , he somewhat funny guy , but it painful listen this cd . you feel awkwardness crowd , not knowing if or when laugh . it continues throughout entire cd . there don't seem any jokes cd all . it all disconnected negative rants bitter angry human . don't believe me ? then go ahead waste your money this horrible piece junk , see yourself . like my review title says , not read positive reviews . just read negative ones , decide how credible they seem . then make your decision buy or not buy	-1
emo noisemaking christian themes . two worst elements our society combined package filled talentless musicianship . face it kids this fad . really pathetic fad . disco fad they thousands upon thousands drones listening participating disco scene . same happened hair metal nu-metal . those scenes completely dead gone so this one one day . you look back this period your life tied up this fad embarrasment your blatant stupidity . i always say my reviews , this trash should treated so accordingly . this band should take their emo wrist cutting lyrics heart kill themselves better humanity .	-1

this album really good , it kind music makes all your headaches go away . no showing off , no over-the-top voices , no see-how-hip-we-are rhythms . it like coming home after long day work . i listen hip-hop , lounge , jazz , rb , house , punk , reggae , funk , soul , everything when i go out , but when i come home , this album kind music i want hear . way , anyone ever mention similarities ray lamontagne first album ' trouble' ? yes , i know that man , but singing frasing , even musical resources both these masterpieces very similar . great tanyas	1
my humble opinion prince debut album ' you ' huge artistic success one his very best albums . but it wasn't even slightly commercial closely related rb funk . 1979 ' prince ' all changed he began his quest building hid own eclectic style mixing funk , soul , pop rock ' roll . this album far more highly polished commercial then debut featuring prince first top 10 pop entery ' i wanna your lover " , catchy funky pop tune original version ' i feel you " -a similar song structure but chaka khan took it all way bank five years later . album consists largely soft love ballads , best which dreamy " it gonna lonely " . two best cuts rockier-the big catchy guitar pop " why you wanna treat me so bad " heavy metal " bambi ' , screaming guitar tribute prince trying convince his lesbian ' girlfriend ' ' it better man ' . very nervy lyric this album alot more then firs t.t he albums funkiest song repetitive " sexy dancer " it groove hard . ' prince ' high quality collection first incarnation minneapolis sound . fact this his debut one gets hear ' purple rain'-era sound it embryonic , trial error stages . what marvelous trip it	1
this album definitely tops their first effort which mediocre best . i decided give them chance i bought album i blown away . it smooth fresh punk beat every song above average . exception basement ghost singing which sorta ' like they first album . if you love punk then you must buy album if you don't buy album . it variety smooth hard beats perfect any listener . top five tracks : 1 . car underwater2 . end fraud3 . truth heaven4 . kind perfect5 . quick little fligh	1

i rarely write reviews , but i need comment how fantastic this compilation . i four-year-old eighteen-month-old , this cd heavy rotation our house . my husband i love music least much they -- it stylish sets great mood we're making dinner doing dishes . kids love it too , needless say . my four-year-old favorites three blind mice ( she loves when farmer wife squeaks she'll give back tails ) final track peggy lee ( where she says word * poop * , " party poop " -- endless laughter ensues ) . ella fitzgerald a-tisket , a-tasket chew , chew your bubblegum priceless . all all , i highly recommend this cd -- everyone happy hear it again again	1
funny thing soundtrack jon brion pieced together " eternal sunshine spotless mind " , it so odd , yet it works so well . songs score , most part , flow seamlessly together , supporting each other great effect . my only complaint two contributions willowz , which doesn't seem fit tone album general . jon brion , if he plays his cards right , could become one most in-demand names film score world if he plays his cards right . up this point , he music films highly acclaimed , but just step or two out mainstream . ( examples include magnolia , punch-drunk love , eternal sunshine , i heart huckabees . ) his score odd , strange , slightly bizarre , surprisingly very touching . most songs good choices , notably two polyphonic spree " mr. blue sky " e.l.o. ( possibly particular group most fun song . ) also , great new recordings beck brion himself , who performs wonderful tune " strings tie you . " if you've got something open mind musically , i'd suggest soaking some " eternal sunshine . " it unique well-thought-out musical experience	1
tuva throat singing impressive enchanting . one songs this cd deepest most sonorous bass voice i think i ever heard . cd gift my yoga teacher , she equally enchanted . ( two out two ain't bad . ) cd qualiy condition beyond reproach . i'm barely resisting starting real collection tuvan music cd 	1
frankenstein drag queens form planet 13 very different sounding band . this cd quot ; viva las violencequot ; they change there directions more violent approach things , rather than their old horror genre . this cd not officially released us , no fdq cds longer sale band . get these why you , you surely enjoy it	1
1974 " odds sods " who rarities album , it great one . it jam-packed various tracks either released solely singles ( or least * intended * single release ) , or outtakes didn't make it onto original albums they recorded . this 1998 re-issue greatly expands " odds sods " whopping 23 tracks ( including previously unreleased material ) , so you're getting whole lotta great who music one disc . there not enough space here me go over every single track , but i'll mention some personal favorites : rockin ' singles " i'm face " " leaving here " ( which two who earliest recordings ) , rolling stones cover " under my thumb , " " tommy " -esque " glow girl " ( it closing line " it girl , mrs. walker , it girl " ) , all-time who classic " long live rock , " excellent " put money down , " john entwistle humorous " postcard " ( snapshot tale life road ) , groovy rock " water , " brilliant " naked eye . " admittedly , there couple throwaways : " cousin kevin model child , " which john entwistle first attempt writing his classic song " tommy , " " we close tonight , " reject " quadrophenia . " both songs listenable , but there really nothing special them ( which probably why they rejected first place ) . but hey , 21 great songs out 23 darn good score . who " odds sods " great rarities collection no who fan should without .	1
this soundtrack just good , if not , better than actual movie ! hans zimmer amazing man written perfect music this movie . soundtrack rocks beginning end . it tells movie story while taking life its own . mr. zimmer definitely deserves academy award this project ! highly recommended	1

quot ; hometimequot ; begins uncomfortably eerie note ghost dusty springfield apparently singing quot;yesterday flame , quot ; one eleven original compositions this new album , her first many years , alison moyet . but it isn't dusty , course ; she died 1999 . it moyet herself , talented chanteuse , sometime channeler dusty , who , since embarking upon solo career , seeking musical niche herself . she may not found it quot ; hometime , quot ; but she comes awfully close , esepcially gorgeous ballads like quot ; should i feel it overquot ; quot ;d o you ever wonder , quot ; which perfectly serve her husky-throated pop vocals . however , there times album , especially title track , when her voice appears coming other end telephone receiver . other places , album overproduced , moyet nearly drowned out arrangements . however , it great her back ; perhaps next time out she'll capitalize her interpretative powers give us cover like quot ; first time ever i saw your facequot ; or quot ; love lettersquot ; ( both found her quot ; singlesquot ; compilation ) not feel it necessary record only originals . big problem moyet exposure : i read this album salon.com, months after it released . she one pop music most distinctive emotive voices ; she deserves wider audience this country	1
love michael buble , but this more like home made movie someone using their camcorder audience . parts michael head cut off , then ; sometimes , his whole head cut off . most time , camera man didn't expect where michael going move you'll get jerky movement camera man trying get michael back into picture . i wish they would said description this more documentary than concert . this just home made videos . this definitely not worth $20 . if you want professional quality concert , i would recommend buying michael buble caught act . caught act worth $20 bucks . you get professional camera men who anticipated michael movements , parts his head never cut off like come fly me dvd . also , sound quality caught act way better . now , i understand why some places sold come fly me dvd word enhanced after it . dvd i received not enhanced . anyways , skip this one , get " caught act " instead	-1
if you're into angry comedians , lewis black deliver lot more than you need , probably more than any sane pearson should hear . he personification all stresses american society today , he not too shy voicing it . if you little politically correct [ wussy ] , or take offence easily , then stay clear , but if you love hearing good verbal lashing , white album leave you breathless . nothings off limits this guy , politicians southerners ozone , plus , he reveals reason we get brain anyrism . unless your cadaver , there no way you won't find yourself thoroughly entertained ... possibly partially soiled	1
my older brother thinks this best dylan album ever . it ? i don't know . " blood track , " " desire " , " highway 61 " " blonde blonde " all records i like better , but right after them , i'd but " jwh " maybe tie it " oh mercy . " don't get me wrong . jwh must own album . not only because you see here how he transitions into his country period " nashville skyline " " new morning , " but because it record plays your head long after you've turned cd player . jwh not only change direction dylan music , but it written while he recovering his motorcycle accident , so one could also assume his life taking new direction well . i'm not sure , but i would think long recovery would make you think life what it all , that what this record seems anyway . least that what i take away it	1
this albun full or steven wrights original stuff way back . absolutely hilarious	1

looking this album sleeve , one cannot miss who almost anything ' my generation ' except sing it . its photo urges you dump this cd right into garbage bin - lightyears away great dave wedgebury-portrait its british counterpart . this cd music already praised other reviews , so i won't go into now . except mentioning keith moon drumming . never heard drummer like before or since , mainly his performance makes this album stand out . 1965 -- until now	1
i'd give this album six if i could . this best hip-hop album ever created , likely ever . it timeless amazing . even ( _especially_) if you think you aren't fan hip-hop , you must spend some time this album . modern [ c]rap this album two entirely different things , this show you what hip-hop really all . poetry , positive outlooks , beats , wordplay jazz . not violence , money , wealth fame	1
i'm pretty much completely board troy collins excellent review drew gress third solo recording . my only questions why he doesn't give it fifth star , why he disparages his previous recordings . i agree this certainly best thing gress recorded , but my own view it merits highest accolades reviewer give it . let take closer look . first off , gress assembled quintessential downtown jazz ensemble : ralph alessi ( trumpet ); tim berne ( alto sax ); tom rainey ( drums ); craig taborn ( piano ) . these guys move fluid grace post-bop , free-bop , modernistic no-bop anyone planet . they consistently nail whatever musical soundscape called . second , compositions both melodic appeal post-modern smartness often lacking these downtownish sessions . really , there not loser nine selections -- entirely admirable avant-garde . i'm thinking nearly any savvy jazz enthusiast could get board esthetic going down here . third , tim berne plays attractively assertively i've ever heard him . there warmth burnished quality his delivery i've never heard him before . fourth , craig taborn proves once again he simply monster his instrument . it seems no matter what context , taborn concept chops deliver just what needed . check out his solo " bright idea " sample what i mean . fifth , i believe i say without contradiction this finest playing tom raney ever committed disc . besides his trademark polyrhythmic attack , there such deep swing rhythmic propulsion his playing one simply cannot imagine anyone else adequately filling drum chair . bottom line , this brilliant contemporary jazz absolute highest accomplishment .	1

forget purple dinosaurs inept adults dumbing down low quality music hyponotize children insincere emotion . this real stuff . this album quality authentic music children love ! my kids wear this album out better yet i like it . maybe little real tv culture . also check out woody guthries - quot ; songs mother child grow onquot ; quot ; nursery yearsquot ;	1

i found one most depressing albums all time , it under my nose . there only one real saving grace off this album , " shine you crazy diamond(part one ) " it rather dark , stark , yet beautiful piece , but i can't say second part song which you endure through 3 horrible songs just get . " welcome machine " boring well depressing it seems like it never ending like " tuesday afternoon " " cigar " also long-winded , depressing , " wish you here " it not greatest , but it also not bad either . i also realized there some conflict going group , capitol records after " dark side moon " wound up so successful , made group move over columbia records , perchance meeting former frontman syd barrett during recording this album also noted . he only 29 when he saw them again , it looked like he aged 35 years then . which same spirit i got when i heard this album all way through december 18 , 1993 . it boring saturday night florida , i nothing myself except put my brother floyd cd collection onto cassette tapes . i don't wish there again .	-1
i absoultely love this album !! i hadn't heard saving jane before kinda just found them while downloading some other songs . i downloaded come down me fell love it . i then preceeded download ever song burned them cd , it my cd player week now i listen every chance i get !! i love saving jane . can't wait next album !	1
diana krall become huge selling singer over years , which often made her target jazz " purists " who scoff anything popular sellout . perhaps she not greatest lounge-style singer pianist ever , but i would argue she very good , popularized style music her success . that not bad thing . her cd , i enjoy this one most . reviewer wrote here , it lot " swingier " than much her other material , she brings meaning lyrics , playfulness innuendo it all . this album great place start those who've liked anything they've heard diana krall . what she , this case smoky lounge music , she very well .	1
it hard describe music explosions sky without waxing poetic . no simple sentence describe music here - it shimmers gleams dances beautifully it itself kind poetry borne duel meloncholy guitars steady , forceful drums . any guitar rock enthusiast - i'm talking you mogwai , godspeed you black emperor fans - this must . listening explosions sky religious experience , invariably . just listen your hand mine try not feel glory	1
everything tool great . they just geniuses . everything guitar , baseline , drums , vocals , good , everything ! definetively worth checking them out ! it took me while get used their long intros outros , their style , but after many listens it just gets better better . best songs album me lateralus , parabola grudge	1
this cd amazing ; nothing more needs said . but those you need convincing : songs addicting glorious . i can't get these songs out my head-and i don't want . it takes six people make music this powerful . if you even considering buying this yourself favor get it ; it worth every penny	1
epiphany : best chaka khan long overdue greatest hits collection one most influential singers ever . chaka khan stamp music industry well documented . known early her career " little aretha " this sexy siren voice which such range . highs lows even some screaming key , this incredible singer . included 16 track cd some her biggest hits like touching " through fire " , mega smash prince remake " i feel you " her first solo hit " i'm every woman , " track later remade whitney houston . there also live version " tell me something good " -the stevie wonder written hit rufus chaka khan . other selections featured cd may not big hits but they definitely showcase dynamics versatility chaka voice . songs like " night tunasia " " end love affair " demonstrate what chaka when it comes jazz tune . there also heartfelt " love me still " , collaboration bruce hornsby spike lee clockers soundtrack . this best cd also features 5 new songs . these songs actually apart shelved 1995 chaka cd entitled " dare you love me . " " everywhere " fleetwood mac song chaka reworks , but instead traditional rock rhythm .... it reggae style . " never miss water " funky tune which features rb/bassist m'shelle n'degeocello .

my opinion , la pistola el corazon watershed album los lobos . their interpretations these songs including their own compositions should shown them spanish way go . my favorite los lobos albums early ones . their mastery roots-rock judicious mix songs spanish made them pleasure listen . who , latino or gringo , could not like their fabulous rendition anselma ? this album , we're given handful gems one reviewer said , only thing wrong album it too short . if you like other songs los lobos spanish , then you should definitely own this one . there variety styles display . my favorites la guacamaya , las amarillas , el gusto , incomparable que nadie cepa mi sufrir . though i not care much them first , two compositions band grew me repeated listens which revealed true depth talent here . i wish los lobos would return its roots i care little its current direction . one only hope band decides take stab music it best record album like this . legions fans thank them	1

nine inch nails only band this cd worth listening , this sound track crap	-1
this guy excellent musician but , my way thinking , this cd not good " triple stop " . cd 12 scale 1-5 . if you see this guy ( vcr/dvd/live/radar/whatever ) you'll blown away . he can't what he he sure can't it way he it . doesn't make any sense but music sure . everybody who likes guitar music or ever got past " " run ought listen him . world full good guitar pickers this guy stands out . this good cd but if you only buy one scotty anderson cd , buy " triple stop .	1
austin , tx band i love you but i've chosen darkness boasts one most unusual band names i ever encountered , it begs question : it distract music , or it complement it ? after band self-released 2003 ep , now finally comes full-fletched debut album . " fear our side " ( 12 tracks , 52 min . ) fleshes out ( matures ) sound 2003 ep , great results . if you not familiar their sound , imagine mix 80s cure-meets-nowadays-interpol . band creates mood dark yet times poppy even danceable songs , great effect . check out opener " ghost " , which sets table album . " lights " one few truly upbeat songs , " last all " . there couple instrumentals way , creating more dark ( but not scary ) mood . other highlights include " last ride together " , which truly reminiscent 80s cure sound , just great , closer " if it me " . this great album . it even translates better live setting . i saw ilubicd concert recently , these songs rocked hard , much more so then studio versions . people may scratch their heads unusual band name , but i hope they go beyond give this band chance . highly recommended	1
i very excited see this cd ep available . mentioned other reviewers , title song thanksgiving day not immediately grab you la you really got me . give it chance it definitely draw you into this quintessential ray davies character study . surface , it happy , nostalgic tale annual family feast gathering so many us grew up still look forward today . but it wouldn't great davies song without somewhat sad ironic twist . personally , i find it very moving . it touches me so many ways . it illicit wide range emotional response most people . i like both versions song though i might slight preference alternate version which track #5 . it seems draw you little quicker its choral introduction . rest ep , i immediately liked 2nd song , yours truly confused n10 its big band brass swing humorous lyric . it got very different sound . nobody confuse this song anything previously kinks . other two songs , i like storyteller its quiet , countrified charm . london song doesn't really much me . it sounds more like interesting experiment , but never really develops song . all all , nice little teaser much anticipated full cd release next february .	1
this album awesome . even though i'm pretty tight " star gun " , i give it 5 stars , if only offset negative reviews . nay-sayers ( those interested what nay-sayers say ): this album compilation morcheeba influences , not morcheeba nor it pretend . some also said it " blaxploitation " feel it , but i really don't feel . very smooth album vaguely reminiscent some unique downtempo mixes found betalounge [ ... ] . so many songs really get into your skin give you hazy , chill , but dark echoey feeling - relaxed groovy but slightly off creepy/good way . fantastic album bedroom	1
if you're sheryl crow and/or shannon mcnally fan you'll love this inspiring new singer songwriter . this cd great blend soft rock ' roll good lyrics . thanks amazon recommendation	1
reading my other reviews , it would become quite obvious i'm one neil biggest fans , yet i heard so many people tell me he really sold out went soft this album . so , though i own nearly all his albums , i always held off this one . one day , i saw it sale bought it ; man i surprised ! neil hadn't gone soft , if this him selling out album , then how come it still so great ? songs beautiful ( not word use describe anything neil very often ) , only couple moments over , but overall everything touched up perfection , rather than extravagance . vocals come across very nicely , though i unlike most love neil singing all time ( i think it raw emotional any voice there ) . neil otherwordly guitar still mix , lyrics , always young , excellent delivered perfect way only neil manage . " weekend , " " harvest , " " man needs maid " " heart gold " almost haunting their beauty . " needle damage , " among greatest tracks ever written subject drug abuse ( close second " sister morphine " stones ) , " old man " like nothing else neil catalogue great track well . other tracks great but don't stand out quite much ones specifically mentioned . this not neil greatest work , but it still masterpiece classic countryish , folk , rock . i certainly recommend album neil fans think non-neil fans may find it their favorite his albums . i positivley love this album , so don't discouraged fact i don't consider it among handful his best , it just man come out such stellar albums , one great this , falls out top 5 or so	1
tree life quieter all around : downs ' songs present more her jazzy side , tend towards less passionate riffs displays , yet smoothly evocative her mexican roots heritage . this isn't say there no spirit here : ' nuevo viento ' , example , adopts near-flamenco guitar style exhibits force downs ' vocal trills .	1
best part latest where " last mohicans " ran all way up after rahun ' leader- nice battle- if you feel soul hero then it must watch	1
first off , i love this band this album top stack essential ... positive reviews here simple hint . said , last three songs here not my personal favorites universe . they explore dissonant realms i feel conjure paranoid elements , anxiety unease . however i admire band accomplishing this . i not rule these later tracks negative light just because i find them unfriendly . this art cause un-ease well astonishment ... not easy feat ! tago mago collective showcase razor sharp musical chops fearless , brazen creativity . it feels like stream conscious work musical virtuossos unafraid fail . music encouraging , spontaneous inspirational . " halleluhwah " almost 15 minutes long never loses it captivating lock listener . it boasts infectiously simple " building block " bass line would kill dime-a-dozen reggae song wrong hands ... instead it soars . i can't tell you how many times i've repeated this track . whole album extremely artistic , including mesmerizing cover art . rhythm here heard like no other . drumming brilliant . vocals cosmic funky alive , among many adjectives spring mind .... just great album . yes , you've stumbled upon something amazing . buy it already	1
i recently bought orignal version , failed notice it missing song . i thought how bad it , but it turns out song bonus , my faviorte song film . its really amazing , so id recommend buying remastered one extra song .	1
they say when painters put their brush canvas , certain energy flows out their fingertips , through brush into paint . over time painter masters this craf t-t he energy becomes visable naked eye it clearly resides colors brushstroked canvas . this concept clearly defines wonderful gift art garfunkel . without doubt there many great singers history popular music , but what makes mr. garfunkel stand out among rest , his gift great craftsmanship . mr. garfunkel one those very few singers who knows how sign his voice song . every song he ever chosen sing , he embraced such way it always come surprise listener he didn't write song . but what no surprise , songs he continues chose sing throughout his musical career . carefully choosing rich meaningful songs such outstanding songwriters such as(paul simon , jimmy webb , mike batts stephen bishop)just name few . therefore , it no accident mr. garfunkel chose billy mann produce " everything waits noticed " . nor it any accident great talents-buddy mondlock aand maria sharp joined him this project . like master woodworker who knows when wood work when it won't- they harmoniously weave together different styles sound evoking feelings love joy feelings empathy self reflection . each song carefully threaded together colorful rhythmic melodies deep meaningful lyrics ( some which composed mr. garfunkel himself ) . obviously these recordings not meant somone who approaches music something you chew till flavor gone then trade cut-outs . appeciate such original music takes more than able hear it requires ability listen . encountering such music this not unlike making new acquaintance quietly evolves into deep meaningful relationship . leaves you feeling way only descibed words henery van dyke once said " glad life because it gives you chance love work play look up stars " .	1

' wild , innocent e-street shuffle ' bruce springteen second release , 1973 . it also , if not his very best releases definately top two one pinnacles artist . " e-street shuffle " funky groove , lot fun points out what makes e-street band so great this early point-david sancious . his keyboard work playful ( such song or simply beautiful flowing such reflective " 4'th july " or just plain good " incident 57'th street " . these songs character skethes-mostly happy ones bruce also goes little deeper into his journey musical success . although sound things bruce possition ' new dylan ' just hype-he couldn't different singer-he gutteraln yes-but also gushes out wordplay lot faster-he imparts more information time given it lot-most these songs over five minutes . this album two big highlites- " kitty back " " rosalita " -on these songs ' street ' sound born . it all classic rock ' soul here , you dance them , get into clerence clemonds sax or just listen wordplay-two greatest songs written just couple girls ! " wild billy circus party " great tuba solo very celebratory he leaves best last winding " new york serenade " -a lenghy story song sure . yes this music lot ideas styles packed into it but character tales he weaves so well mostly fun it this time out . but mainly these songs lot soul great fun rock roll kick-back basics all way , well coyly funky here there . when people refer this one bruce masterpieces isn't hype-it truth . so if you want get into more springsteen after ' born run ' , go no further then street shuffle	1
sublime good band never lived see their full potential . their self titled album their most famous album , filled such well known songs " what i got " , " santeria " , " wrong way " . album mixture reggae , hip-hop , some punk , similar debut but much , much more focused less " jammy " . spontaneity debut missed hardcore fans , theres just something way songs it(ruca , badfish , dj .. ) gel together , blending different styles music , missing makes it less fun . they still capable band this release , however , it still delivers goods overall	1
my opinion , this beautiful album . they didn't follow behind any other music time it sounds like music en vogue always . they quite nice without dawn . some songs this album could've scraped or filled song .. or reworked but majority very intriguing . highlights album : riddleno no no ( can't come back)love you crazysad but true**love won't take me outwhatever , be**beat lovethose dogs . other songs tolerable but they're not ones i listen over over like ones i listed . if someone debating buying album or not .. i think it definitely worth purchase . it your type " just sittin around relaxing , enjoying day " type album . 7.7 out 10	1
i am totally feeling this cd i mean i wanna get up get crunk everytime i play it ( e'eryday ) if you love down souf crunk ish then this cd must	1
modest mouse hard love . many their albums grating . i know they good , but life me i can't enjoy them wholly . maybe this makes me less intelligent somehow , i prefer more mainstream good news ... their other albums . but i find good news gets stuck me i just can't shake songs . this album all feels very new . it welcome mainstream radio , but remains unique . single float bit hit rightly so ... it feels good honest . it what pop should sound like . album still intensely creative , while sometimes tiring ( i get older waiting genius songs grow me ) here songs immediately catch . favorites ocean breathes salty , view , satin coffin , black cadillacs . give them chance if you haven't introduced them ... fanatics don't get all freshman music-angsty them saying they sold out . you know it good :	1
many kylie fans either hate or love this album , i am one few love it . it nothing but pure pop , no emotions or meaningful lyrics ... just fun , sexy dance music you groove . alot songs sound like those fillers very addictive fun , but no real impression . this type cd you listen while cleaning around house or driving your car some friends background music . i personally love it . there few real treasures though i believe some kylie best .. " loving days " , " chocolate " , " cruise control " just name few . it'll interesting see which direction she goes her next album .. i've heard it gonna alot more personal mature than her previous albums due events she went through . love you kylie , keep working your way up ! you're queen	1
i've always held philosophy you what you're entertained . so , those who like ludacris definitely telling themselves their views life women . speaking women ... ludacris never met one who wasn't h-o . ludacris epitome sexual hypocrisy plagues men : you demean look down women h-oes , yet you hope every woman h-o so you'll no problems getting laid . but then , you're so disgusted fact woman behaves too much like you , so you go find " nice girl " because you respect her marry her procreate her . but then you cheat her " bad girl " because h-oes need h-oes ; but then you can't respect " bad girl " because she slut , so you go back " good girl . " but she not nasty enough you , so then ... around around we go . women basically punished men not able make up their minds what heck they want us . he obsessed sex h-oes . it makes you wonder if he hang-ups it . maybe ludapis saw his mother selling herself backalley dollar it scarred his outlook women forever . i guess if she actually raised him shown him how respect women -- all women -- then he probably could grown up respectable guy instead prurient dummy he . what music like ? well i'll give him 2 stars mentioning tlc what your fantasy . that it . addendum : 7/27-07 some may wonder why i'm " wasting ' my time giving ludacris negative reviews . well , first all , if only people who liked product only ones review it , everything amazon would 5 stars , which would inaccurate sign its quality . secondly , i don't like ludacris . i would give ludacris more respect if i felt he gave my gender more respect ; but he doesn't . my diatribe above shows what my problem him , i feel argument valid . there no way critique ludacris ' music without critiquing his hypocrisy regarding women . why should i like him when he seems nothing but contempt us ? i'm biased against him because he biased against me . so he gets bad rating out s-p-i-t-e	-1
legend john scofeild playing medeski , martin wood ? whats not too like ? i guess argument it bit repetitive track-to-track leaning too [ ... ] sharp nine valid . but so what ? if you're mood some guitar driven jazz/funk this suit you just fine . calling tracks this album " throw aways " then comparing them " kind blue " ( one most prolific albums jazz history ) -- sheer [ ... ] .	1

i've known marvelled matt music almost 15 years now continue enjoy his incredible sense tone timing . it not enough monster guitar player ( he ) , but my astonishment not when somebody tries overwhelm you their skill but underwhelm you their sense musical composition steady knowledge , yes , they rip it up pretty much anybody but choose instead woo you gently through their songs . matt achieves this ; his vocal guitar style unique tom waits , greg brown , or van morrison . i occasionally hear new song played radio instantly know it matt ward , i always smile process . wonderful music calm sunsets , glass wine , wonderful companions . please check out his early works , if possible , see him live .	1
maysa delivered knock out punch this here cd ! her first venture without backing incognito she not only nailed it shut , she buried it deep , dug it up flung it out ballpark ! that how serious it ! her version ewf " head sky " enough make one run buy this cd , yet if you're still unsure , her duet downing brassy , latin tinged tune " simply life " enough make you leap before looking ! she sang " deep water " incognito , but she really went into deep end this project ! well !	1
very good , excellent fast delivery not able find shops	1
this awesome album listen when you feeling down . it renews you . most songs this album slow rather than fast . ryan definitely uses his talent this album . don't buy this album if you not like slow music , because there only few fast songs this cd like " start " , " hit me your light " , " shine " . i hope this review helped you	1
this cd fine cd , avid collector , die hard madonna fan ( like myself ) just lover 80 music . you get 5 mixes " like prayer " three " express yourself " . you also find here local mix " express yourself " , which included orginal vinyl , but not remastered cd . 1 . like prayer ( 12 " dance mix ): this great version like prayer version , one appeared immaculate collection based . 2 . like prayer : ( 12 " extended mix ): this mix wonderful , because it based orginal album version . only thing i not like it , first verse left out , best verse whole song . 3 . like prayer ( churchapella ): okay this not true apella . it softer vocals than orginal , little music . it very gorgeous version wonderful lover tame songs . 4 . like prayer ( 12 " club version ): this version my fav version like prayer , it based orginal includes first verse . 5 . like prayer ( 7 " remix/edit ): this just edit 12 " club version . 6 . express yourself ( non-stop express mix ): this version express yourself , would fondate one would make it immnaculate collection . this version very well turned out more popular than album . 7 . express yourself ( stop go dubs ): notice dub plural here , that because there two dubs here . 6 minutes first dub ends there 2second pause new one begins . how awesome ! 8 . express yourself ( local mix ): this version mix , based abum version . i like it lot , beause it based orginal album . this cd far madonna must , so you son't this cd , then click " add cart " buy it	1

last broadcast musical expression where one goes when one hides one emotional vulnerabilities into realm depths one imagination . i like every song this album including two tracks which really build ups into other songs . there goes fearwordssulphur manpoundingcaught riverand satellites ( which almost reminds me updated variation xtc " satellites " ) all songs pockets proud melancholy . deep baritone vocals reminiscent red house painters or ride . music reminiscent verve . but sound very unique album good any i've got my collection	1
if you're buying this cd because you've heard john lithgow " singing bathtub " - don't it . this not same toe-tapping , sing fun music . fact , i find it difficult hear what sung over orchestration . i can't stand listen it	-1

ah , this great album . very feel-good . contains some most rampant catchiness allowed run around disc . frontman justin pierre voice reminds me cedric bixler large , large amounts barbibtuates . his extremely pleasant singing voice . every track very good its own right , but ones i really look forward " everything alright ( 2 ) , " " when you're around ( 3 ) , " " feel like rain ( 5 ) , " " time turns fragile ( 7 ) , " " let get f'd up die ( 8 ) , " " together we'll ring new year , " " hangman " " hold me down " ( tracks 10 , 11 12 ) . but i always listen album whole way through . skipping songs ex-heroin addicts . so , even if you hate emo culture inherent , buy/burn/download this album give it least three or four spins . you'll hooked . then listen few more times tell me it doesn't put you into good mood	1
very dramatic music - felt like battle . not easy listening type music any stretch imagination	-1
i there first cd thought it really good . this even bettre . real hard hitting rock . sleazy , fun , polished . well worth wait .	1
most atdi fans i meet say this album or relationship command their best albums . i would say this , my opinion , their best album . energy emotion throughout each every song clearly heard . acrobatic tenement good start it energy emotion but what album lacked abstract lyrical content cedric some polish music . production quality better , music cleaner or more focused it obvious how much band matured hell paso ep ' 94 this album ' 98 . music lyrics not basic this album they previous work . el gran orgo not bad ep but you tell couple members leaving after first full length there not much could stood out effort . i think this what they looking . relationship maybe bit more accessible music shows even more talent them than this album but this album just captures essence what this band me . this album really got me into atdi . me there not one bad track this album . if you new atdi definitely pick this one up , it worth it . reviewer below me , some greatest voices over years sung way out tune . bob dylan , lou reed .... just name couple , they heavy influences lots people . out tune adds effect this band cause it not meant flawless album . this band not meant polished , they displayed raw energy , confusion , emotion youth . i really don't think people care how cedric voice sounds , its emotion behind it . plus you should go pick up mars volta album hear cedric wail those albums . than tell me he not good front man	1
i absolutely love this group . this album . lyrics amazing . tinged every conceivable emotion weaving endless often devasting tapestry so wrought debilitating anguish lonliness strong yet paradoxically volitile grasp hope redemption it becomes poetry , pure unfettered . music equally strong versatile , beats engaging seem remain , dancing mind long after song ends . listening futureperfect , i often feel like voyeur , gaping into deepest recesses human spirit -- its vulnerability , couragousness , acceptance inevitability cruel , mundane reality while clinging desparate hope triumph spiritual awakening . their entire discography shakespeare set music -- exploration nearly every facet human nature human condition spiritual psychological whole . this album chapter which probes most intensely dichotmoies hope despair , aspiration acquiessance , individual collective , above all , inescapable earning failure realize love	1
i , like pretty much anyone else , first saw lewis black daily show always likes his ' back black ' , mainly because he really good point out stupid things kinda show western society its downfall . course september 11 discussed even though he not first discuss airport security it remains funny , though george carlin best bit it . my favorite part end universe houston texas , where there two starbucks right across each other . it hilarious , made me think ' best show ' . if you like ' back black ' you certainly entertained this , f-word	1
after band practiced " sad wings .. " they ready release first real classic band history . still some songs sound more like normal hard rock(which no wonder , because roger glover , bass player deep purple , produced album ) but tracks like " dissident aggressor " or " starbreaker " classic priest material trademarks band . much better than first two records sign coming ( metal-)storm	1
patience virtue when delving into lot pinback work but sia more ferocity than any pinbacks earlier efforts ( except maybe offcell ep ) easy casting-off point new fans group . third full album pinback simply stunning . more " user friendly " tracks like " fortress " " non-photo blue " alongside songs like " this red book " " bloods fire " ( which more akin tracks blue screen life pinback ) , summer abaddon pleasant journey into emotional realm consisting pain longing previously left un-touched pinback often technical or even methodical style . tracks flow into one flawlessly , softer more upbeat songs placed appropriate intervals , all building climactic , drum-driven " afk " : screaming listener " remember summer abaddon " . but such remarkable moment hard forget . my only complaint album now i wait pinback next move ..	1
mr bowie should stick acting - i thought he excellent labyrinth but this spin off album which cynically tries cash success unimpressive say least . mr bowie could learn thing or two smith who both sing act . shame	-1
i love this cd . gil scott heron brilliant . i particularly like quot ; whitey moonquot ; quot ; revolution not televised . quot ; message still socially relevant today	1
this good album aly aj . tween : every song send strong message kids ( strong , stand up yourself , etc . ) , which i find it good way encourage kids . teens or older : honest , it difficult me find uniqueness each song because , i listen each song closely , i find out every song similar lyric beat/melody ( excepts rush , no one , ride , collapsed , slow down ) . there not enough element me tell each song apart . personally , good song me song you'll know right away when you hear first melody . even though , each song expresses different message but they seem use same word over over again ( ex . " something more " ) . sorry say this but i find it little disturbing . but i'm sure their song writing get better ( deeper ) they grown older . so , keep up good work , girls ! if you're tween - you'll love this album . if you're teen or older - you'll like/enjoy this album .	1
when i first listened this cd tower record sample shelf , i amazed high quality this recording . music sacred voices both pro arte singers theatre voices clean clear , you feel you listening music heaven . excellent performance	1
sure this not bruce springsteen first great album , he released two other albums before it all his early albums great , but none them define him well this one . one thing enjoyable springsteen music he very opposite glam rock phenomena over taking world early 70s . he rarely wrote glamorous life rich famous instead wrote level middle-class man trying heard world . process he creates wide range colorful characters stories range teenagers trying break free darker subjects such crime punishment . it starts album opener , " thunder road " , classic , " i wanna break free life farm " , type story . piano riff beginning creates very humble simple atmosphere leads into yearning verses love , hope , ambition better life . thats only track one . we continue through road everyday hardships songs such light-hearted , " 10th avenue freeze-out " , anthemic , " backstreets " , title track . track , " born run " , major achievement songwriting . guitar piano riff hopeful lyrics really convey sense cruising down highway , away all your troubles worries . " she one " , starts out emotional ballad before exploding into anthemic rocker . we're treated whimsical darkness , " meeting across river " , before venturing into albums final longest piece , " jungleland " . lightness hope album all comes end dark horrifying finale this song . bonnie clyde type tale ends violently but hardly inappropriately . bruce springsteen hailed savior classic rock-n-roll , steering away both more complex prog-rock fast punk-rock 70s . springsteen would go into darker subject matter his follow-up , " darkness edge town " , he would return anthemic his hit , " born usa " , but this album got him moving it always remembered one his greatess achievements	1
friend mine gave me our winter love gift when we teens i never recovered absolute beauty this instrumental . how happy i am find out soon i listening it cd ! amazon , you rule . this music start images your mind take you place ..	1
this last cd art poter made before his death he missed . this must buy	1
it holds up just well today . past few years , market flooded wrestling-themed albums , mostly containing 30 seconds generic entrance music stretched out 3 or 4 minutes create " song " . least these " real " songs , which best you say them . originals , only keepers jimmy harts suprisingly catchy " rick springfield " absurd yet moronically toe tapping " capt lou history music " . covers , hearing nikolai volkoff sing cara mia worth snicker or two , but not more than , mean gene singing all embarrassing ( although not bad his " rock roll hoochie koo " off wrestling album ii , barely ) . all wrestlers chip " land 1000 dances " , although i cant quite remember if original boasted lyrics " i'm gonna rap you my cane , you pencil neck geek " or " i'm gonna crush you my avalanche " . song patter okerland , mcmahon , ventura most part stilted unfunny . please , i abhor you , spend your hard earned money something little better	-1
writer/producer/director guru tim burton , danny elfman , johnny depp round off trio edward scissorhands seems worked well them so far ( cf . other films such sleepy hollow , charlie chocolate factory , corpse bride ) . particular , burton direction storyline here create character edward sensitive loving , child-like navit , but who grossly misunderstood feared . depp masterful acting complements story wonderfully , making viewer surprised edward uniqueness , but also compelled his sense compassion unjust treatment . elfman accompanying score delicate tender , it simply couldn't better . true elfman style , we find we both comforted his music , same time , left sense unease perhaps things aren't pristine perfect ( quaint town here edward set ) they seem . indeed , elfman score includes gentle choir , wistful strings , soft bells . every turn edward makes , elfman music there guiding your ears your mind through world new , exciting , fantastic , but somehow dark mysterious . highly recommended	1
i listened this album i actually felt cancer forming my ear drums . nelly wack hell period . he modern day version mc hammer . take look music he making now . this album commercial hell but when you slide down nelly resume it gets even more commercial . i mean how low you go ? country grammar some decent beats get professionally wasted but number one beat waster world . nelly worst rapper actor ever walk this earth . what we need people like this yank him off stage tar feather this klown . check out real hip hop like mos def immortal technique	-1
this excellent set put out philips it renowned duo cd class . almost all mozart violin works here . arthur grumiaux , one my favorites , superb job interpreting mozart works . this last weekend i played same works heifitz comparison makes interesting listening . i can't say one better than other , specially since i no formal training music , but each artist definitely leaves impression . excellent set superb value but most importantly makes valuable addition anyone collection .	1
i now purchasing my 8th personal copy this album . some reason i can't hold onto this disk if my life counted it . what more i say , i continue buy this album when it disappears my collection . truly masterpiece . thank you sublime !	1
this my fave neil young album . all his records kind loose , inspired vibe , but this one sounds like soundtrack some cold autumn night up north spent local bar where band rockin you good spiritual buzz goin . it always gets tagged precursor grunge , it may , but me its just good heavy jam album played bunch guys who really enjoying themselves . guitars distorted resonant , bass drums laying down solid rythym neil singing uninhibited inspired place . i wish more bands would make records like this because it never gets old i don't think i'll ever get tired it	1
this all very lo-fi indeed ... all arrangements very basic , even tinny times , stephin merritt voice probably acquired taste ( it brings mind formulation leo kottke came up describe his own voice : geese farts muggy day ) ... but still , this sprawling collection songs many varieties love , smooth crunchy , works impossibly well ... some cynical , many deeply moving , but even throwaways stick memory ... they're all great there're too many highlights list here , but my personal favorites ( least today ) set : " papa rodeo " , " sun goes down ... " , " i don't believe sun " , " i don't want get over you " .... yes , easily one best ' 90 	1
... i always knew their two big hits , baby now i've found you build me up buttercup radio i decided take plunge into group other music . what i discovered though hits good , they not best songs this realy good cd . bad bad old days , born live born die , baby i couln't see , take girl like you , my little chicadee , something my baby especialy ridiculously catchy stoney ground all more than enough convince any listener this group wildly underated . must sixties classic	1
radiohead not come easy me . it took few months several listens ok computer when it came out me get into them all . when kid came out , i found same thing . however , my past experience , i knew listen album few times before i could judge it . it soon became my favourite album radiohead , then my favourite album any band , then put radiohead position my favourite band . this album not collaboration songs . it much more like one single song , several movements whose contrast support each other drive album perfection(this album actually debuted mtv full , without breaks , one track immediatly after other . there no singles released u.s. album ) . this reason , i cannot name favourite songs it . i could go abuot what this means music , how this band came out post post modern work etc etc , but i dont like this album whatever " significance " it may . not i anything against those you like it . i'm jsut music itself . heres bit summary : thom his best , both lyrically sound his voice itself . he cuts disturbing images into mind lines like " cut kids half " " here im allowed everything all time " , yet paints saddest , most beautiful pictures same time . his voice ranges detached impersonal(while speaking deadly words , nonetheless ) positively dominated raw emotion i honestly couldnt describe words . apart lyrics , music itself least important wholeness album . jonny greenwood dropping guitar eerie strings dead electric instrument " how disappear completly " , sad organ " motion picture soundtrack " , sawtoothed electric bass " national anthem " ( which actually played thom , even computer vibe " kid " idioteque " seamless ... necessary , word , kid album . this album truly masterpiece , real example how new music not completly faded into catchy tunes fade memory constant imitation talentless pop whose image means more tahn their music . there creativity left popular music , radiohead kid shows it more than any other album i've heard . give it try . then give it . understanding it takes time , but it truly worth while	1
my 45+ years collecting listening popular music , j.j. cale stands out truly unique . how so ? easiest way explain this talk my ipod song list some 1700 selections . what i've create this song list choose only my favorite tracks any particular album ripped onto ipod . some albums represented one selection ; others two or three . very select few , perhaps whole album gets included my ' po d.j.j. cale prime example this kind personal special favorite musician . why ? well , we all know , there no accounting taste . each us our own musical preferences , tastes , favorite genre . me it blues based music , whether it hard blues rock jimi hendrix , early elvis " sun sessions , " or mellow country blues j.j. cale , i love blues . here what i experience j.j. : deeply felt , genuine , totally organic blues expressions . instrumentation always tight , together , groove . each musician , each track within song , each overdub blends perfectly whole . , . . ' lyrics , melodies , vocals , guitar work essential masterly glue makes it all happen . what this means , me , his music timeless quality . it doesn't get out date , it doesn't get " old , " i don't get tired listening i t.t his why when i ripped j.j. album onto my ipod , i almost always whole album . i 123 j.j. cuts ' pod , but i won't buy " very best j.j. cale . " i no need because i already all these cuts . however , if i could only own one j.j. album , it would double set " anyway wind blows . " without checking it cut cut , i'm fairly certain " blows " all best " very best . " but , " blows " you get least twice much . . this very good thing , but if aren't convinced my opinion , least try out " very best j.j. cale . " if you're able appreciate good music any genre , you just gotta dig j.j.	1
i feel pretty confident saying anyone who knows who mary lou lord knows time time , she found playing quot ; her spotquot ; mta green line . this recording some her time spent there awesome . it lot covers , which all fantastic , but i think best thing it hearing snippets conversation occasional train running ... because really adds essence mary lou lord . its just great . yes . great . wooooo	1
this album hard review . it some very strong songs it : dig down deep , i tried , blunderbuss . listen samples , they pretty good indication . they beautifully crafted , melodic , just generally wonderful . brad tuneful writer , interesting , slightly unconventional voice his credit . but among tracks some duds too . i'm unable listen cd all way through . i get impression brad didn't band , but he knew lot different musicians , almost album worth tunes when he started . album drifts pop masterpieces unfortunate rock mishaps . good tunes sound like jellyfish ... bad tunes sound like smithereens 4-track . plus , i'm not getting lot feeling out these songs . even best tunes , while well crafted musically , aren't personal all . i still no sense who brad jones . i hope hear more brad future , but , if you planning buying this album , prepared jumble . still , impressive craftsmanship good tracks , i give this album 4 stars . long i'm here , i should mention you should check out steve ward solo album ... it like this one , only more consistent definitely more heartfelt	1
if your looking something you rock , like kmfdm , pig , or slick idiot , then stay away this cd ! musically it way different then what i hoping . there variety musical styles here , non which good rockin industrial . so if you don't mind different , buy it , you'll like it , just don't expect much otherwise	-1
joe strummer streetcore one best albums ever . after few rather poor recordings during 90 , strummer came back this rock-masterpiece . it sounds good any his efforts clash or 101er . sound album hits some risky area near rock reggae , yet it couldn't classified either . it something magical only strummer could possibly conjure . why , exactly , this record rock so hard ? songs , course . album starts off rollicking track titled " coma girl " , it definitely one strummer best moments . exactly what he means rather bizarre lyrics he sings throughout song anybody guess , but music pure , genre-clashing ( excuse unintentional pun , clash-fans ) excellence , whole album only two slightly-mediocre tracks ( even they aren't bad , honest ) . those two " redemption song " " silver gold " . first cover famous bob marley song , although second doesn't fit rest cd , lyrics particular track chillingly prophetic , therefore acceptable . strummer sings , " i'm going everything silver gold , i got hurry up before i grow too old , " . it really makes you understand strummer knew end near ( strummer tragically died shortly after album release ) . this album timeless , clash / strummer fans everywhere , it strangely ( yet strongly ) emotional experience . it essential every clash library , even those who aren't huge clash fans appreciate its classic-rock sound . finally , hard-core clash / strummer fan myself , i rate this album better then any clash album except their self-titled debut london calling . it best album i've heard years , i don't think i could say enough nice things it million years . indescribable , modern , rock masterpiece ( how so many clash fans denied its existence upon its initial release beyond mortal comprehension , my opinion ) . i rate it solid 5 stars . it perfect .	1
this cd obviously one catchier dcfc releases . i love this cd . it dcfc album i go back again again . one my big complaints albums 1 good song , 2 ok songs 7 bad songs . it makes me feel like i wasted my money buying whole cd , but photo album very good collection songs . this 3rd dcfc album i own , it very good . music so amazing . these guys real talent . dcfc definately won me over long time fan . melodic pop mixed deeply emotional lyrics just what world needs more , good no nonsense music . i am looking forward next album	1

simply unreal . what happened boys ? time they took paul boutique this album very well spent . this album exudes creativity originality . it funky , it sharp , it just plain fun . boatloads fun . instrumentals real treat , but pass mic , so what'cha want , lighten up , jimmy james best tunes . seriously , folks , one best 5 hip hop albums ever . 14 years later i still listen it monthly	1
considering i'm day late dollar short review this album when it first came out i still feel it should known those who not enjoy this album it only because lack content you missing your brain , heart . i think d'angelo extremely talented ( but not so bright given his current status ) no matter what situation ability make hit album it 5 years sophomore or 10 . see what others lack content . artist out today quickly whipped up local talent shows or what you modified fabricated suite high school needs today society . d'angelo my generations smokey , al , gerald what you ... he legend . moreover , if you don't agree , just go put your back street boys or 112 ... ugh !	1
this significant improvement over mediocre uxo release . music herein moves compelling direction there internal logic what offer here sets them apart their own work well others like explosions sky knob-obsessed pelican . throughout progress tracks each disc there intriguing blend instrumentation , each passage rising organically foundations laid music progresses . i haven't heard this sophisticated stream musical consciouness since topographic days yes . while not overtly stravinsky-based anderson co , these canadians sense working much bigger canvas incredible array colours their palette . all it works . i found myself surprised when each disc ended . itself significant improvement over uxo . hopefully they shall survive working team . who knows what recognition gourmet magazine them . odd karmic twist band disdains its own success retailing efforts which it must concede . this release they establish themselves quite lot say musically dialogues among each other , i'm hoping discussion continues	1
i gave this cd lot chances . i honestly . i've it months now , but i honestly can't get into it . it not i haven't given it multiple listens feel its full , err , ' brilliance ' - it just pharrell , this album , not appeal me . i'll expand this my review . pharrell williams , we all know , one half super-producers , neptunes . i first heard neptunes ol ' dirty " got your money , " i liked their technique song . they also scored one . o . . . ' catchiest solo tracks , track " super thug , " which , while moderately annoying , still pretty decent track . fast forward few years , they're working likes jay-z snoop dogg - suddenly , everyone wants neptunes ' production . i'll quite honest , say i'm not much fan neptunes ' production techniques . i've always found most their production follows steady format - tropical beats , make you feel like you're literally living florida . fact , tropical production so authentic you nearly smell old people when listening neptunes ' typical production . sometimes they'll take different production , rely heavily drum-machines synthesizers ; tracks such this(drop it like it hot , grindin ' , mr. me too , etc ) , they succeed . otherwise , nearly all their tracks sound like rehash snoop dogg " beautiful , " which they also produced , it really makes me wonder why they're such popular demand . pharrell artist ? i very mixed feelings pharrell artist . while he actually dropped some tight guest raps other rappers ' songs , his rhyming shown off sparingly , i didn't know if i'd able tolerate entire album full rhymes like " elegible bachelor , million dollar boat ; that whiter than what spilling down your throat . " his flow interesting , he speaks much more softly than average emcee , so one his pros . pharrell singing ? honestly , i never liked pharrell crooner . his falsetto grates my nerves point i just skip track completely , entire track full nothing but pharrell singing , such " angel " (which i still can't even tolerate after multiple lessons ) , nearly like nightmare audio form me . i still gave pharrell chance despite these drawbacks , my harsh criticing him past . tracks i like " raspy **** " ( which features tight sample drop it like it hot hook ) , " keep it playa " slim thug , " take it off(dim lights ) , " " stay me " pusha-t clipse , " skateboard . presents : show you how hustle . " rest tracks , yes , all 11 them , no appeal me , even emcees like jay-z making guest appearances(and definitely below hov standards ; or average emcee , matter ) . two five tracks i liked only succeeded because guest appearance , however , other three genuine pharrell tracks i enjoyed . i give this chance , i want like it , no matter how ire i may neptunes ; honest , i don't want dislike neptunes much i , but their repetitive production work continues annoy me . this album nothing change my opinion neptunes , or pharrell , i consider quite unfortunate	-1
i read many years ago this first ever stereo cast album columbia . timing ( late 1956 ) would right . maybe someone who savvy recording history confirm or deny this . if you want see film verson ( also starring judy holiday ) it aired tcm once while . it last musical produced legendary arthur freed	1

ok go one most amazing albums past ten years . its got everything everyone ; funky , up-beat just plain fun songs , like ' c-c-c-cinnamon lips ' ' you're so damn hot ' ; ' don't take no crap no one ' anthems like ' get over it ' ' don't ask me ' ; even bittersweet tragic ballads ' shortly before end ' ' return ' . all-in-all , this disc brilliant , you would off your rocker not buy it	1
not only cole porter songs wonderful , but ella interpretation them gives them life . no one it like she . i this record album couldn't live without purchasing cd . i can't stop listening it	1
this really decent enough offering slim thug though folkz who up boss hog since way before houston became " tha spot " hip hop last year tell you he better material . far repackaging h-town sound mainstream , commercial release , " already platinum " solid consistent . " 3 kings " bun t.i. radio single most y'all probably heard ( it video too ) ... nice flows all three , but don't expect great variation topics content . you gotta know what expect what you're dealing , so those regards , it pretty easy appreciate this album strong if typical lp da south ( not meant insult ) . i'd buy this album ( again ) just track " diamonds " ... great bass , pulsating , syrupy beat highlighted slim baritone . that'll probably go down my all-time favorite slim thug track . he don't need chopped screwed ... dude voice chopped screwed ( lol ) . oh , don't sleep " miss mary .	1
i liked most song album . tracks " hold me down " , " ride you " , " want it " " stay me " my opinion , best tracks record !.. i recomended anyone likes pop music	1
if you're fan regular book musicals , this one not you !!! passion operetta style love triangle complex , poignant , beautiful . stephen sondheim brillaint score ties entrie musical together , which again helps him keep his genius status . clever weaving songs , scenes , , most interestingly , letters , make great cast album . performances , it females who own this show . marin mazzie glorious ever clara ( she even better ragtime ) , tony-winner donna murphy brings all emotion forward her portrayal fosca . those who used usual sondheim , this one may dissapoint . others , however , love this opera love	1
i own several jobim lps/cds . i love them all . this cd , however , my first real intro elis regina . i heard her once or twice brazillian compliations , never her own album . this cd highest artistry . songs , arrangements , chemistry , singing -- 360-degrees beautiful .	1

i got turned onto this album 2-3 years after it came out , it shot right up top my most-played list . thirteen years later , it still gets regular rotation my cd player car . this album stunningly good . if you like british soul/acid jazz vibe , this album you . album excellent start finish . i wish i could pick favorite song , but then i keep listing other favorites until i've listed every track album . other two d'influence albums " prayer 4 unity " " london " not measure up good 4 we , although prayer much much better than london , which i thought very weak . but please , if you don't already this album , it must you add it your collection	1
i first need say , if it weren't dvd all its features , anywhere but home would gotten three stars . i say this because , evanescence not sound good live they studio . cd : this contains audio rock band performance live paris . it also album most beautiful stand out track : " missing " . concert : overall sound balance this rock band way off this performance distorted guitars tend drown out anything form musical line . amy lee also her share troubles this performance . she sing her high loud notes pretty well , but her lower ones tend constant use pedal tones . late into performance , amy voice cracks even starts give out her . she however , know how work crowd . bands newer tracks well performed , covers they perform sound better than their own work . this good bad ; it shows evanescence play pretty well , but they need lot more practice playing live communicating each other live . best part this concert getting see beautiful amy lee perform add new very interesting introductions some band songs . awesome performances include : " thoughtless "" breathe no more "" farther away "" bring me life "" whisper " dvd features : this disc awesome because it so many features . it course evanescence performance paris . it also music videos " going under " , " bring me life " , " everybody fool " , " my immortal " . there also hidden video icon evanescence band symbol . when this activated , live performance " bring me life " played . disc also tons rehearsal , bloopers , road footage ; including evanescence tour seether . credits also audio evanescence newest track " missing " . anywhere but home interesting concert fun look into evanescence life , i recomend viewing it	1
hard one rate , but i ended up four stars you see . " money cigarettes " pretty good little album , even if it isn't one great , lost rock ' roll records . it its share good songs , though , times even bordering great , like rocking version sleepy john estes ' wonderful blues " everybody ought make change " fine " i've got rock ' roll heart " . music benefits star players like ry cooder veteran soul bassist donald " duck " dunn . couple clapton self-penned songs , like " shape you're " " pretty girl " pretty forgettable , slick 80s production doesn't help . but " ain't going down " fine rock ' roll song , " man overboard " groovy blues-rocker " man love " . great , simple yet effective blues riff one . clapton also covers classic " crosscut saw " , he band good job it , both vocally musically ( excellent rhythm guitar playing ) . all all , " money cigarettes " better than its reputation , even if it isn't " layla " . 3 1/2 stars . good enough	1
sinatra fan , i tell you this not represent his best output . i hate cynical but part me wonders if this album prompted desire squeeze just bit more cash out some tired old numbers . there no point getting sinatra re-record selection favourites - he too old his voice all but gone ( let face it ) . so why not get him croak few lines then fill gaps some lesser stars then market it duets album ? instrumental arrangements band itself great . but singing best uninteresting worst laughable . duet bono complete joke , one barbara streisand tedious uninspiring . fact , just only one all enjoyable duet summer wind julio iglesias . no , this not good album third-rate quality it highlighted rumour sinatra pre-recorded his bits others filled gaps later . i find very easy believe . there so many good sinatra albums collections around , so why would you bother this offering ? go listen him his prime	-1
son conductor , player arranger during struggling period mine closures uk , i would say this excellent cd introduce listener into subtlety brass music . striking arrangement jerusalem full-tilt william tell overture this cd gathers so much into such small space . i am happy add this my collection other grimethorpe vinyl , , even if you don't think you brass/silver band fan , i guarantee you there something here you love	1

lot greatest hits cd offer five or six great songs few lesser known hits or some filler . this collection hits alan jackson absolutely marvelous . it captures him his fresh prime during early 1990 number 1 hit after number 1 hit . there 20 cuts here there isn't bad song anywhere . my favorites : don't rock jukebox , chasin ' neon rainbow , tall tall trees , love got hold you , dallas etc . etc . well , you get idea . this one greatest " greatest hits " cds any genre . time prove this cd essential purchase what high quality neo-traditional country music all . sound also knockout .	1
this one albums people dream . i usually tire listening same thing over over but this my rotation now 3 months . every song reeking brilliance definately force reckoned	1
given some unfairly low reviews i opted rounding up . no one going putting paul wall up there nas , but say man ain't good words just ignoring his talents out distaste his subject matter , frankly , his appearance . notice who shows up most often other people cuts now out still tippin ' crew . mike jones showed up badd it . slim thug few , paul wall showing up jim jones , nelly , game , i don't know how many others . back cd , i'm reviewing mixtape version this , so there few extra tracks order isn't quite same but it all still there . now , yeah , paul wall tendency say " what it " lot we already know he likes sip oil show off his grill . so why this cd worth listening ? because if you're fan wordplay actual rapping , there lot like here . he got great knack words even when retreading subjects he phrase it new way . not everyone going talk political issues like nas talib kweli , frankly if they there wouldn't much just cruise . i sometimes think people complaining this cd poor sound systems so they only really hope words make interesting stories . this cd you pump into your subs ride . one thing makes paul wall extra impressive his skin color never part what he raps . even my personal favorite white boy rapper , haystak , tends push almost forefront ( note : white boy trilogy , though i consider him far better lyricist ) . he not around because he white , he not treated like white boy trying rap game , he just there like everyone else swishahouse crew . top songs ( since this all anyone cares ): - sittin ' sidewayz- march step- they don't know- trillbuy it , don't worry how ridiculous cd cover looks	1

i thought movie good points ( action dead what sometimes happen trucks cars accidents ) bad ( theme not all drivers bad ) . i'm trucker sometimes other drivers don't think before they things or worse they figure we all those wheels so we more brakes . not true . i liked movie because it gave people different perspective . sound track gotten me through many long miles long hours .

although i'm hard time understanding lyrics , musically these guys sound like softer , more accessible strokes . right now i'm listening track #2 " consolation prizes " , i really like rhythm this track . rousing drums guitars real americana rock sound you don't hear much these days . vocals , while not so original , not grating or overproduced . i hear some electronic synths , but they're used moderation . nothing this album over-produced or overdone . nice blend catchy tunes quirky lyrics . overall catchy easy listen album this french foursome . well	1

remember style music came out late 70 called punk ? pioneers this type music bands such clash , sex pistols , ramones talking heads . style becamse somewhat funk-influenced gut-wrentching hardcore metal influenced sounds dead kennedies ministry . even social distortion their own little sound offer . this how it went through 80 . yet , after who nirvana-mania saved music whitesnake warrent , punk , well many other sounds , seemed lost until ... green day comes around " dookie . " this continued punk sound into what we know today . so words oasis : " where it all go wrong . " it not this sounds it own bad . when blink 182 first came out , they lot fun offer . but gawd , where we draw line ? after , we ( no particular order ) sum 41 , new found glory , my chemical romance , showoff , jeez , i could go forever . they all sound so much alike . still they once tolerable . but simple plan , ( sigh ) , enough enough . i can't even tell difference sometimes these guys bowling soup . i don't easily confuse bands . really , though , these guy call themselves punk . but last time i checked , punk rebellion , anarchy , disatisfaction where humanity going , all stuff . ex sex pistols " anarchy uk " or ramones " i'm against it . " now listen some titles off this : " i'm just kid , " " god must hate me , " " i'd anything .

i can't work out what this band trying . there elements metal , punk , riot grrl , grunge , all which handled most rudimentary way . if music inconsequential you all you're looking cute unconventional singer worship , then jack off jill may band you . if you're looking good tunes you won't find them here .	-1

there just one little problem ... this not opra . least , not " tommy " originally presented . opera involves live performance including acting , costuming , stagecraft , singing actors character ... sometimes even dancing . rock band could conceivably perform cantata or oratorio , but not opera . not themselves . so call " tommy " first rock oratorio . it tells story spiritual message ( handel " messiah , " also oratorio , shares these features ) not really demand staging ( though film oliver reed ann-margaret pretty successful ) . this musicological tirade aside , i remember very thrilled old 2-lp set when i bought it hot off shelves spring 1969 . listened it more recently , it holds up very well . best songs power beauty apart whole concept , but course make more sense context . one need not follower meher baba ( townshend ) appreciate message - we all deaf , dumb /or blind ( or least asleep ) much time . apart , music really rocks . keith moon drumming seldom more expressive , pete guitar work ( mostly acoustic ) quite original time . daltrey gets little shrill times my taste , but lower register he powerful . " tommy " therefore excellent songs , fine playing , philosophical message ... probably most successful fully-realized concept album 1960s	1
this album , almost everyone knows , one new order least critically acclaimed albums . reasons very simple -- aside few more experiments drum machines , there seems virtually no new territory covered their time joy division . when you barney taking ian place , it only seems get worse . but you must consider this released year after closer . course , joy division grew leaps bounds their punk days unknown pleasures , thence closer , but this level growth could not maintained any band , especially one lost their lead singer only year before . they should applauded " moving " -- what movement all . what music ? if you fan joy division music , you likely fan this ; i hear distinct echoes ( but not rehashes ) " atrocity exhibition , " " komakino , " " insight , " " decades . " if you fan new order early singles or power , corruption lies , you probably like this , too , certain tracks looking forward " blue monday " " age consent . " this album very , even surprisingly , enjoyable despite its historically lukewarm negative reviews -- it both martin hannett atmospheric , moody mix some experiments electronica joy division already starting experiment . if anything , energy brilliance movement should convince anyone joy division not ian curtis solo act ( undoubtedly important he ) . if this viewed critics debut ( which it arguably ) instead disappointing follow-up closer , it would fair reception it deserves	1
this album introduced edwin mccain world , it wonderful amalgam rock , blues , jazz , featuring acoustic electric guitars perfectly blended saxophones woodwinds , layered edwin beautfully powerful voice . there no other album out there this particular sound . if you ever loved edwin mccain song , then you simply must get this album . unfortunately , woodwinds abruptly disappeared his next few albums , only reappear latest " scream whisper " . you'll appreciate them here	1
cover this album describes it ' leave-taking british folk revival 1970-1977 ' indeed period worth commemorating . this collection , sadly , not it justice . there only 13 tracks ( only 9 artists , 4 them appear twice ) what there no way represents best period . watersons great group , but lal waterson , singing solo two these tracks , painfully out tune . other performers this album fine , well worth listen , but you find them all better represented other albums . i realize this selection restricted recordings trailer label , but i cannot believe this best they could . both quality quantity lacking . sad leave-taking indeed .	-1

before you dismiss me stupid hater , hear me out . i personally think omarion reasonably good singer one helluva great dancer , but i swear god this one worst albums i've ever heard . this album entirely deprived emotional depth there not shred originality sight or -more importantly- sound . you've got love , sex below-average club bangers , but nothing beyond ! if there anything annoys me more than fact i bothered taking time listen this near-worthless junk , it knowing omarion fans groupies insane enough blow their hard-earned cash propel this album into #1 spot billboard album top 200 ! says alot musical standards nowadays . however , there some bright spots album show hints true potential omarion . " i wish " beautiful slow jam wishing he never fell love his certain girl , while omarion hit single , titled " o " , any girl melting slowly they listen his smooth vocals , regardless unoriginal subject matter . " touch " also highlight , combining catchy , simplistic , danceable beats smooth vocals unoriginal subject matter ( this case , lust sex ) . then again , most club bangers don't need much substance , so it no big deal this case . i personally think this track deserved more success . oh yeah , better not forget " growing pains " , touching song explains omarion break-up former hit rb/pop group b2k ! however , 3 great tracks 1 above-avergae track ( touch ) not enough save this album falling apart . rest this album utter garbage ( put it lightly ) , anyone least 1/2 brain realize how tragic this album really . omarion needs put more thought substance into his music before anybody truly begins take him seriously ! i hope omarion improves if he decides make 2nd solo album , but until then , definitely skip this !! nb : case anybody wondering why i bothered review album i consider so bad , it because i feel nobody , i mean nobody , should wasting their hard-earned cash such ridicious , mentally corruptive bubblegum cr*p like this . not only , but omarion doesn't deserve success his album got . there obviously many more artists out there who more deserving success than omarion terms solo career	-1

i found myself listening 30 seconds each song then skipping it . it nothing new . it not it bad cd , it just not very good . songs little more fast paced " pop-ish . " overall , cd departure her typical style . i felt kind like i put 50 cents soda machine coca-cola dr. pepper came out instead .	-1
however , all good material early 90 coming out i suckered into listening just every little thing . this some rather blah songs it , thing they try sound like everyone , but themselves . " dead bloated " they try sound like danzig , " sex type thing " which best song whole album they sound like alice chains , " wicked garden " " plush " they sound like pearl jam , probably only song they sound like themselves " creep " , this one i some rather bad memories this i remember this one songs i heard all time when i first moved down florida . i moved down no job , or no car , i bored out my skull , no social life either , no one seemed speak one . lyrics go " feeling uninspired ... think i'll start fire " . now i down florida full time i wasn't good time , i know even now listening this song makes me remember those hard first few months down here if they yesterday , it because times i feel it . everything else this album too perverted , or just too long-winded .	-1
its very likely mxpx never out-do their masterpiece " life general " . thats alright though , because they'll still put out quality cd such this one . building " ever passing moment " its more mature but still retains energy enthusiasm their previous cds . there many great , memorable songs here : " play it loud " deserves exactly , its perfect song crank up rock out . single " everything sucks " also standout cd " it alright " , " you make me , me " , " well adjusted " " capitol " . but i wouldn't say there bad song this cd , just couple aren't up par rest . but its solid rock cd , just don't expect " life general " or " teenage politics " .	1

this first cd i ever owned , bought me christmas present back 1993 when i 13 , i still listen it regular basis . when i younger i mostly just liked music because i liked movie , but i've grown older , i've gotten appreciate melodies emotions i feel when i listen i t.t he soundtrack composed two different composers , trevor jones randy edelman . edelman stepped finish soundtrack after jones unable complete his work due commitment film , but songs mesh together so well , you hardly tell difference work two . my two favorite songs album " kiss " " i find you " . if you ever loved instrumental music , pick this album up . you won't sorry	1

many self-proclaimed " indie people " tell you this hands down , best album belle sebastian . i've concluded through years dealing people like this they purposely choose obscure odd-sounding music claim it " awesome " try showcase themselves more understanding knowledgable music than you could ever . those people love this album more than other ones . don't get me wrong , this good album . but it much softer , times , simply weirder than 2 albums i enjoy , " boy arab strap " " tigermilk . " people love this album tell you those records bad , their reasoning basically boils down fact those albums instantly accessible enjoyable their face . you get immediate gratification listening those albums . this one , i feel like i am straining enjoy it way i enjoy those . i shouldn't feel like . musical elitists tell you otherwise	1
best schoolhouse rock ! audio cd : original titles orignial recordings . also recommended those car rides where you sing your kids . my oldest not exposed week yet , but already sing several parts . rating : 4.5 /5this collection " some schoolhouse rock songs made throughout 70s 80s . i think it great nostalgic educational point view . although , looking back it i never realized my innocent days there touch marlo thomas boy-bashing it . dr. james dobson wrote excellent book called " bringing up boys " , which i would recommend any mom or dad . read this book , you see subtle colorations schoolhouse rock ! put boys down . nonetheless , i like it basic education components , i remember many those songs ( even before we bought this , i teaching my kids ' 3 ' times tables ' 3 magic number ' song ) .	1
i've never understood slagging this album got most but not all quarters . its peaks outstrip anything face dances or new , truly lame endless wire ( pete lost his melodic muse , i'm afraid ) , compares very well who numbers who you ? some songs stand townshend best , including athena , known no war , one life enough , utterly amazing why i fall ?, which simply one best townshend songs who performances . entwistle turns some his best writing band well , it your turn dangerous . yes , there few turkeys ( cook county , one day time , excrable eminence front ) , but great songs make it worthy who album , imo	1
first track this album leaf house completely blew me away . i sat awe listen it 5 times row it even begin sink . times , its alot take . highly psychadelic extremely beautiful	1
if you're wondering whether or not buy this album , i settle your mind . you should definitely buy it . band sound this distinct only arrives every couple years . only parallel i draw 60 group chambers brothers ( hence psychedelic soul reference this review title . ) when you receive it mail , you may disappointed first . i suggest putting " dreams " ( track 3 ) repeat letting it sink . then move " staring sun " ( 2 ) , don't love you ( 7 ) ambulance ( 5 . ) album it sub-par moments , which mostly lie- i think- production . it prompted my friend remark it sounded " un-finished . " debut album , however , it surely sounds better than most , particularly considering stylistic boundaries crossed- their future albums promise very interesting indeed . if you disappointed increasingly cookie-cutter , formatted indie music released world , you find this album very satisfying release frustration .	1

god it soo perfect i cant even begin describe . every dayevery night starts " line allows progress , circle not " , song also holds album title inside its gracefull lyrics ; " this feeling always used pass , but now it every day every night . " it song someone who forgot purpose her life , someone totally lost alone , nothing but get drunk looking exit desperately . they always ; conors lyrics tell story natural , mournful way lyrics haunt you whenever you hear them your ordinary life . song pass you its haunting guitar melodies probably leave you questioning your own life , possibly tears your eyes .. then , you think if connor ever anything more touching then this one , " perfect sonnet " begin . believe me no words i say enough tell you how touching , moving , rocking , devastating this song !! song gets slower faster over over , it make you think each line connor tells , each section ; which dagger your heart , you may cry over over screaming this song nights thinking everything you wrong everything you've lost all your life . t classic bright eyes song , what i say ?!!! " then comes my way work " song questioning passing life death , way you dont really wanna like thinking abou t.t he song not great overall , but it still bright eyes , it quality turn you upside down moment you least expect , some line you've missed out before , or some piece melody you havent noticed ... new arrangement ; it resembles arienette , one greatest bright eyes song ever;it not good arienette but it like passage , preparation i t.t he most this ep resembles feversmirrors , so if it released just before it , it'd make total sense . last song , i didnt got into it yet , never even listened it all my ears but i'm sure sime time now i'll really see what song it'll effect me just like all others time . final , important note .. yes ; bright eyes songs not songs listen just , like . you need ready songs things he'll say you , otherwise they probably not make sense . i see some people giving low stars bright eyes telling not great musician or lyricist we all say , they blame him pretending sad . i just want say i know , these people just not ready , or not strong enough him , sadly some them never . but if you one those deep people , still confused way life works ends , or figuring out how love matters give meaning it all , buy this ep .. you'll not regret i promise	1

back twenty or more years ago lacy . dalton sang 16th avenue , superb country song unknowns seeking their musical fortune nashville . one verse this lyric : ah , but then one night some empty roomwhere no curtains ever hung like miracle some golden words rolled off someone tonguewell , that train . they miracle drops jupiter who knows where it came , but come it , like slap face always remained fabulous every overplayed-on-the-radio hearing .

it seems listeners don't understand this album not greg dulli , nor it fila brazillia . it entirely new synergistic beast , this why it not called " fila brazillia plays dulli " or something like . this one few albums i listen hours upon hours , this entirely result experimentation , collective vision , superb analogy lyric , instrumentation production . somehow , twilights able combine racking heartache betrayal appropriate bittersweetness create masterpiece ephemera . i constantly feel after listening i lost something deep inside -- but found marrow myself nevertheless . songs abounding soundtrack i play inside my head , tracks twilight invariably pop up out blue , i find myself humming hours . it truly complex album too -- i'm always finding note here or there i never noticed , without which songs wouldn't quite same -- hallmark excellent work . quite frankly , this beautiful album true unfettered emotion -- layering sounds only serves further amplify -- segues fantastic , rivaling perhaps second side abbey road . irony here album ability make you feel if you're falling love despite lyrics such " tell me where you . " again , bittersweetness always leaves me wanting more	1
many kylie fans either hate or love this album , i am one few love it . it nothing but pure pop , no emotions or meaningful lyrics ... just fun , sexy dance music you groove . alot songs sound like those fillers very addictive fun , but no real impression . this type cd you listen while cleaning around house or driving your car some friends background music . i personally love it . there few real treasures though i believe some kylie best ..

this one best ambient compilations i've ever heard , which surprising since most artists relatively unknown . consistency this album remarkable , only one mediocre track entire album . stand out tracks include . o . .

every year christmas , people listen christmas music watch christmas movies , while most people like peaceful christmas music , lot people like parody christmas music , anytime you want good , funny album parody christmas music , you should turn bob rivers . rivers hillarious , usually every year christmas ( last year rivers not release cd ) he release album parody christmas music . " twisted christmas " lot fun . only dissapointment this cd short , four minute skit " visit st. nicholson " , which just not very funny . rest album hillarious , topics like hangovers christmas , wrecking malls , restroom doors talking , dressing up like santa when you get out parole just plain funny . " twisted christmas " released 1987 , some music parodies this cd sound very 80 . i think i like bob rivers ' christmas music better than i like peaceful christmas music	1

john coltrane one my favorite musicians . i would give almost everything he recorded five stars . " afro blue impressions " recording really turned me trane first place , one i've listened most over years . every tune outstanding , but i particularly love " my favorite things . " this version completely different studio recording , much faster tempo , extending over 20 minutes . mccoy solo one his best , trane playing phenomenal . times he sounds like two saxophonists engaged duet . this john coltrane quartet their finest , which means it some greatest art ever produced any medium . i agree some other reviewers who criticized sound quality these two discs , but music more than makes up it . any coltrane collection incomplete without " afro blue impressions .	1
this amazing collection covers man minute midnight his life , just heartbreakingly beautiful . it like he understands exactly where he , where he going , he made peace journey . listening johnny cash , you get feeling he understands every bit pain you're experiencing - he like older brother who you go when you've dumped your girlfriend , he'll tell you everything going all right , even though she go off bloke , after telling you she loved you so many times . but it fine . johnny cash my older brother these past few days . i'm glad he there me . he someone i actually trust . his advice kept me going . god bless you , johnny	1

edwin mccain plays intelligent pop music . he appeals those good music taste while playing basic structure acoustic pop songs . what it ? maybe it his voice , fabulous . maybe it his simple songs world , written just enough creative spin make words interesting . but , whatever it , he great it . far this particular cd , it not going bring him any more popularity . there no standout single it , which probably means no radio time edwin . but , if you enjoyed his past efforts , you'll find more same this album . if you're first time listener , pick up " messenger .	1
this compilation features some wwe wrestlers performing their own songs . just fact alone , this cd doomed failure . let face it , these guys can't sing !!!!!! only tracks that're even worth listening dudley boyz ' '' we've enough '' , john cena '' basic thuganomics '' , chris jericho '' don't you wish you me '' . everything else just laughable attempts making music . stone cold skits , which stuck songs , quite funny . because music stupefyingly bad much it running time , you could almost say it so bad it funny . if you like wwe music , buy '' themeaddict '' instead .	-1

jazz , rb , rock , soul , funk , pop music all existed before 1982 , but when this album came out , it literally combined all elements paved way what music today . recordings performances worldwide sales recognition , jackson set standards it all . hundreds years now , this still looked back quite possibly one finest albums ever recorded . while quincy maintained his masterful touch all recordings , jackson lent his timeless compositions " wanna startin ' somethin '" , " beat it " , " billie jean " , songs literally become signature songs 1980s , showed world just how musical michael could . aside those recordings , master songwriter rod temperton ( " rock you " , " off wall " , " always forever " ) rb soulman james ingram contributed their own unique tracks , well . " thriller " " p.y.t. " , every song here literally changed course music whole . while some maintained there far better albums music history catalogue , i yet come across any much quality , energy , diversity , versatility this one . masterpiece	1

culture club may gotten attention largely due antics its gender-bending lead singer boy george , but group released some truly great songs back its day . sometimes dismissed fluffy cross pop , reggae , motown , culture club records soul , thanks smokey-like voice boy george . quot ; time , quot ; quot ;d o you really ... quot ; quot ; church poison mindquot ; all surface this hits collection , which compiles group hits well some solo material george . curiously , this album skips unfairly maligned quot ; waking up house fire , quot ; which decent quot ; war songquot ; quot ; mistake no . 3 , quot ; neither which here . i guess george grown embarrassed this disc , which flopped 1984 signaled demise group popularity . moving solo stuff , best quot ; everything i ownquot ; pet shop boys production quot ; crying game . quot ; more interesting club-oriented jams he released under his alias jesus loves you . all all , this disc covers considerable ground recommended , but i dock one star not including singles quot ; waking up ... quot	1
" howl " comes so close good . they capture real authentic " backporch " sound , great production . lyrics passable , singing isn't too obnoxiously affected . but there just aren't any good songs here . it like when you meet someone who dresses well , seems share some common interests , make small talk like champ . but then when you finally try substantial conversation you realize they thoroughly uninteresting , just sort suck all around . well , it musical equivalent . they set great vibe beer drinking , sitting porch , etc . just like tape whales calling each other really gives you authentic ocean feel . but nice they sound , whales don't write good music niether black rebel motorcycle club . alot people see music primary function providing nice background . i'm sure they'll pretty happy this cd . also , lot people lifeless zombies no souls .	-1

i looking billboard hot 100 last year like i every week , one point i noticed song making moves " grind me " pretty ricky . i never heard song , after i listened it , i wished i still hadn't heard song . i don't know what possessed me listen full-length album , bluestars , but i , well , i couldn't get cd out my stereo fast enough . i agree reviewer hakeem when he said all these five-star reviews must people group street team or something . pretty ricky consists four people : three rappers ( spectacular , diamond " baby blue " , slick -- i use term " rapper " loosely ) one singer ( pleasure ) . problem this album these horniest most talentless guys i ever heard , terrible combination . lead single " grind me " really called " grind me " , it one nastiest things i ever heard , but " playhouse " isn't far behind . " nothing but number " very , very statutory . also annoying their use dated lyrics , like " if lovin ' you wrong , i don't wanna right " " grind me " , or " if i'm lyin ' , i'm flyin '" " grill `em " ( what even mean , anyway ? ) . guys also habit continually yelling certain adlibs , like " back ! " " get little closer " , " yes , sir ! " " your body " . also , while pleasure singing isn't horrible , it hard listen after all wack rapping . actually , his chorus " shorty mine " sure cause you displeasure . speaking song , things equally unimpressive when guys don't talk sex , like " never let you go " , " can't live without you " , obligatory bling-blingin ' songs " chevy " " grill `em " . but long run i guess all doesn't matter because nobody cares pretty ricky any more my brother said , they're probably now back working wendy . if i ever come across bluestars cd again , words " your body " , dammit , i'll beat it up . anthony ruper	-1
overall , i think this best adiemus works . symphonic overtones add greatly richness songs	1
most singers scream mountaintops heard . others strategically position themselves taken seriously . but maysa leak , vocalist underexposed incognito , grace oozes so effortlessly , her peers must scrambling wonder how she able it . her solo debut isn't going make anyone forget incognito , but it solid album shows she able stand her own . disc mix jazz-laced soul never makes leaps bounds make statement ( heads up , alicia keyes ) doesn't stray too far her past work incognito . like kite windy october afternoon , it soars ease . favorte tracks mine quot ; black heaven , quot ; quot ; we change world ?, quot ; quot ; peace mind . quot ; maybe , one day , mainstream catch up maysa find out what it missing all these years	1
absolutly my children all-time favorite cd car ! children under three may bit young appreciate it , but once they get " sing-a-long " age they'll hooked . my kids three five when we got it , just right . though now getting " cool " ages 10 12 , they still pull this one out occasionally . theme album musical journey through buyou country , mc'ed conductor " zydeco express . " tracks he talks music songs . some reviewers felt their children didn't like or appreciate this part , but i believe they soak more it than we realize , evidenced my kids ' recall some details years later . it great introduction fun genre music	1

i first heard incubus when listening my halo 2 soundtrack . there four incubus instrumentals it , needless say , they great . so christmas i got " crow left murder . " first it difficult get into , but later i enjoyed it whole lot . incubus most unique rock band i ever heard before . their sound differs nearly every other band out there . cool thing incubus lyrics ; yes , occasionally you'll get f-word few songs , but listen lyrics--they're great ! incubus focuses multiple aspects music enhance their quality , they great job . i say right now there one track aclotm i not like all -- zee deveel . i dunno why , i guess it just didn't sound all good . other hand , its lyrics pretty good . multiple songs aclotm get points across . megalomaniac shout-out people who think they're above society . talk shows mute criticizes annoying prresence talk shows . souther girl love song . each song some sort meaning . they also all sound different . which great thing incubus : they don't restrict themselves hard rock . they aren't afraid experiment other songs . sure , you metal songs like megalomaniac priceless , but then you slower tracks such agoraphobia , southern girl , my room , talk shows mute , made tv movie . then there " in-the-middle " rock tracks like crow left murder , leech , sick sad little world , beware ! criminal , pistola . then course you strange song zee deveel . this cd totally worth listening . it one most unique albums out there , i highly recommend after you get this one , get morning view make yourself well .	1

projekt delivers compilation cd , but this time twist . what i like most this collection songs style which they delivered ... cabaret . i particularly like revue noir black tape blue girl tracks , i also find it very nice see rozz williams track this cd , which came quite surprise . overall , i think this fairly good cd , especially if you looking something different listen . my only complaint i wish it more tracks . but only six bucks , you can't beat price 45 minutes worth music . they say you get what you pay , but this case projekt delivers way more than expected . bottom line : if you like dresden dolls , you like this compilation . buy it now	1

this album 5 star album anyhow but this dvd audio just blew me away . songs like grey walls , backlash love affair you dream too much sound like brand new recordings . i mean i heard guitar tracks i never new existed . mitchell froom much criticized production works very well here hearing it 5.1 surround experience all itself . very well !!!! addition excellence this fine dvd audio you also get two bonus video tracks , i misunderstood i feel so good , which thompson amusing attempt more mainstream/mtv-ish so maybe larger audience could attracted , nonetheless it nice extra any thompson fan . this dvd audio convinced me see out more , it impressive	1
one or two hip-hop flavored tracks here kinda hamper soul this album , but there vintage omar songs here more than make up it . check out tracks your mess , get it together , feeling you(stevie it ! ) , my absolute maybe all-time omar favorite , ghana emotion , gem murders just every song i heard this year . this definitely worth buying make sure you grab prior works total omar experience .	1

hombres mujeres de todas razas ( pero del mismo coraz�n)- ' re ' es un disco que tienen que comprar . lo compr� hace un a�o ( antes de ir m�xico por primera vez ) ahora es uno de mis discos preferidos . �por qu� ? es una mezcla graciosa de estilos - hay punk , mariachi , tango - hay algo para todos , pero creo que esta m�sica no gustar�a tu madre . this album appeared so many lists ' latino all-time greats ' i buy it . caf� tacuba band same vein ' talking heads'- there something manic music , when you hear this album first time it doesn't make comfortable listening ; indeed whenever music faintly mellow you realise these boys sending up certain genre it soon going turn weird . however , immortal words dr hunter thompson ; ' when going gets weird , weird turn pro . ' this album really works . mocked sentimentality tango mariachi they laugh absurdity punk then move re-invent some other musical genre . they perhaps ultimate post-modernist rock band they deserve better known anglo-saxon world . so it came huge - thought not unexpected - disappointment find myself practically only gringo audience , when i finally caught up them shepherds bush empire other week , when they gave one funniest performances i ever experienced : they sent up boy-bands one stage elfego buend�a , vocalist now calls himself , even donned wrestler mask ! great band , new album ' cuatro caminos ' pretty damn good too . if you make it mexico city , don't miss caf� de tacuba , calle de tacuba , just north z�calo . they serve excellent breakfast .	1

i am normally not fan classical " greatest hits " type albums , but i make deserved exception this cd . this cd excellent introduction all different styles mozart famous ; it slightly over 75 minutes music contained its 25 tracks . selections largely well chosen , although nitpicky i would preferred slightly more representation his sublime horn concertos . said , i unabashedly recommend this cd anyone who wants good overall overview works mozart . my particular favorites cd " marriage figaro " , " magic flute " , horn concerto number 3 e-flat " , , course always beautiful " symphony number 40 minor . " amazing thing this cd actually not music presented , but unbelievably low asking price cd , particularly considering recording quality excellent little no background noise detectable , even fairly high volume . this cd highly recommended anyone .	1

little help my friends exceptional debut joe cocker . it contains wonderful mix covers few originals , title cut rips beatles ' original shreds any day . also not missed cocker rendition " don't let me misunderstood " , sung sound like it coming at-heart pacifist who occasionally loses his cool other people . pointing out other highlights pointless , this album should taken whole	1

owner every single chill/lounge music cd i am aware , this biggest dissapointment long time . chillout 2001 thru chillout 8 very good comparison . this cd not complete disaster , however , i could not find one song worthy 5/5 star rating . quite few 4/5 star songs however , lots 2-3 star songs . some better songs repeated older chill discs or present other series lounge discs . i think people rated this 4 or 5 stars don't own lot lounge/chill probably lot easier please . i'm very dissapointed . maybe this ' genre ' all dried up ! :) oh well ... i highly recomend any cds this set before this one . fact , chillout sessions 7 superb !!!	-1

when searching recordings south pacific , i first got original broadway cast mary martin ezio panza . while two outstanding , recording itself wornout , fuzzy , limp . i next bought 2-disc 1997 studio cast recording , which complete expertly . i thought enough , untill i heard rave reviews over this recording . it indeed surpasses every expectation . book restructured make story flow better become much more powerful . this comes out recording . two added songs , cut original , " my girl back home " superb " now time " , make recording priceless . but shining glory cd philip quast fresh invigorating lauren kennedy . lauren turned already amazing , complex , just plain fun character nellie into fresh new woman filled spirit joy beyond belief . no matter how many recordings south pacific you , no matter how many times you've or seen show , this recording bring you new perspective newly amazing masterpiece musical theatre	1
i just love lead guitar work " desolation row . " lead guitar punches up dylan voice those surreal lyrics make this song like no other . i shudder whole eleven minutes every time my husband plays this song he plays it lot . you never get tired this . mr. dylan really raised bar this one . " like rolling stone " rocker extrodinaire it goes six minutes , which big deal when it came out , because most hit records never when over something like three minutes , ten seconds . dylan really broke mold " stone " , opened up scene others record long songs . this super cd . one you just own	1
i all buddha bar cd this my favorite far . this one i play most often . it just takes you away world	1
altough this album came out many years ago , choas organized madness layers this piece still overwhelm even most hardcore tablist heads . even those outside scratch community more " public music " mindset appriciate it concept album it may still not understand audio album unless they accompany dvd film spawned album . this cd .... lack better comparison , hip hops " tommy " , its " rocky horror picture show " , or even " wall " really praise this piece . say it so few words , this not hip-hop concept album . but rather , it hip-hop epic .	1
context : first todd snider album i heard happy here 2000 . i thought " how come this guy isn't more widely known ? " while listening -- twelve or thirteen tracks -- some rock , some blues , some melancholy , among all several gems , most particularly , d.b. cooper . sardonic , tough himself easy target others his music , he reminded me randy newman , most especially , john prine . now songs daily planet comes across my scope , bringing it some partial answer my question , snider same place six years ago -- uptempo my generation skewers , well , his generation . easy money bluesy account trying get what you haven't earned . me , bit self-pity road song . turn it up , life bad , play music loud , classic this cd , you think you know somebody , far more effective take child abuse than luka whose royalties still paying suzanne vega rent . i heard these songs after i heard happy here so they seem faintly derivative . but course it other way round overall , this slightly better collection than happy here , but d.b. cooper still pick hit me	1
if you're exploring ska , five iron frenzy , or christian music general , buy this album . i garuntee you you enjoy this album immensely . this far my favorite five iron frenzy album . light-hearted , upbeat , yet superbly well written played . they give off vibe lets-just-scream-our-heads-off-and-have-fun punk band , but they all extremely good musicians , their talent shows quality their music	1

this motherlode pre-war blues reissues . it likely jsp finest release date . paramount started business wisconsin furniture manufacturer late 1800 but figured demand record playing machines ensconced wood cabinets would create new market shellac vinyl records well . spite their hamfisted business practices ( paramount bankrupt 1930 ) , they managed get whole lot fabulous afro-american talent record their label ( thanks talent scout . mayo williams ) , likes charley patton , meade lux lewis , bo weevil jackson , bumble bee slim , moanin ' bernice edwards , little brother montgomery , roosevelt sykes , charlie spand , papa charlie jackson , course , peerless geeshie ( geechie ) wiley . if you've never heard her " eagles half " , you deserve listen it now . this set 100 titles some rarest blues ever recorded just $25 . some 78 which this collection dubbed , sell collector market hundreds , even thousands dollars shot . spite poor quality shellac paramount pressed their music , virtuosity this music still comes through some 80 years later . get it . you won't regret it . similar material worthy this set contained yazoo records " stuff dreams made " , revenant records " american primitive , vols 1 2 " .	1
i looked forward this album number my favorite songs it but i disappointed songs like " hard times " " lady margaret " not sung all way end . both left off two thirds way through song . i mean if you aren't going sing complete song , why bother	-1
if you know nothing particular jazz cd but see art blakey drums , you bet it'll good one ( you say same thing jimmy cobb ) . this lineup features big names freddie hubbard wayne shorter , also well-regarded curtis fuller , cedar walton , jymie merritt . lineup promising , songs very solid . they seem pretty even me , i don't want name best worst songs , because my opinion hardly set into stone . there also bonus versions four six songs . original album 40 minutes decent length . thing makes this 4-star cd there aren't any great songs , they're merely all good . if it song like " egyptian " or " moanin '" , it'd 5-star cd	1

jeff lynne wanted quit recording albums under elo name some time . he felt formula elo limiting his abilities songwriter/producer . he stepped forward fine final album . " balance power " handful terrific songs including great " calling america " . this exapnded edition features alternate mixes " heaven only knows " introduction ( put separate track)that missing final album " secret lives " (an alternate take ) better than final released versions my opinion . " sorrow fall " alternate mix album track . we also get two sublime b-sides " destination unknown " " caught trap " . songs previous released first elo boxed set but rightfully regain their place next stronger tracks this nex t-t o-last elo album . when lynne would return elo only richard tandy would play " zoom " . here band trio lynne , long time drummer bev bevan ( who also member move lynne only member every album elo except " zoom " )and long-time collaborator richard tandy playing keyboards sythesizer strings . lynne plays both guitar bass . although production use electronic drums date album , they add charm album . while this far my favorite elo album , lynne best qualities songwriter -- strong sense melody , creative arrangements production touches dominate album . you also hear influence steve windwood " arc diver " " back high life again " richard tandy playing sythesizer similar sound winwood popular singles those albums . i'd give " balance power " 3 1/2 stars addition alternate mixes/versions inclusion two fine b-sides .	1
this skip spence oar cd really bad . hear other peoples reviews it sounded like best thing world . its no wonder why this album flop when it came out . thirty five years later it not any better .	-1
my favorite new song this new indigo girls collection " let me go easy , " wonderfully engaging meaningful songthat i keep going back again again . i avidlistener their music ten years now , i own all their studio albums , well several other collections . even this background , this song risen near top my favorites list . not missed!i've heard bootleg version " finlandia , " but version isnot nearly beautifully realized rendition included this collection . wonderful track ! " uncle john band , " which , although available perhaps other sources , not part my collection before getting this , really enjoyable song . i especially likethe pacing vocal line , " i live silver mine /and collect berrys too . " i haven't chance thoroughly digest cd yet , butother tracks stand out me so far " mona lisas mad hatters , " " i don't wanna talk it " " clampdown " ( chillingly relevant bush his ilk so much power ) . there least three songs i would loved seen included here , though : " blood quantum , " " letter eve " " wisteria . " they included , my rating probably would five stars . if you longtime indigo listener , don't miss this one . you really want " let me go easy " wonderfullyrendered " finlandia " especially .	1

much fan i claim this group , i gotten into them around early 2002 . i high school sophomore home listening music choice channel when i heard " run wild " come . when song finished , i imediately left my house walked store buy this album . judging this all others i've heard , this tha ( alkaho)liks first shot mainstream group , especially their first single " best u " produced neptunes . results : mixed feedback hardcore fans this group . this my first album , so i really no say whether it good or bad . besides two tracks i named out , second track " bar code " featuring xzibit ( who i hoped kissed made up this group ) slammin track . this album , this trio doing three things : making party music , like " l-i-k-s " " sickness " some those tracks ; showing off their lyrical skills like they've previous albums like " promote violins " featuring kurupt , " bubble " featuring king . ; humorous " 40 oz quartet " . there aren't many things i mad this album . some guests like busta rhymes defari absolutely nothing tracks they appear . also " da da da da " track little replay value . other than , this album highly recommended if you ever go house party want something listen . some people say this tha liks ' best album . i believe " likwidation " their best if you ask me . but i highly recommend you get all their albums ( heck " firewater " little dissapointing , but still recommended ) , if you like hip hop style . this album 16 year old high school kid soundtrack getting drunk . lyrics : a-production : a-guest appearances : bmusical vibes : a-overall : a-favorite tracks : bar code , run wild , l-i-k-s , sickness , best u , bubble , 151 , promote violinshonorable mention : 40 oz quartetpeace	1

bottom line : very enjoyable album anyone open mind . girlfriends , boyfriends , single people , married people , old , young , male , female . you probably already know ( like ) least 3 songs this album : " every morning " , " someday " , " falls apart " . so , you're already off great start . , those you old-school sugar ray rock fans , there plenty here you . try " personal space invader " , " aim me " , " glory " , " burning dog " if you enjoy cranking it 11 . actually , this album predominantly rock inspired ... if you've listened whole thing . hip hop fans find " live direct " featuring krs-one pleasant little surprise . 80 fans take their spiced up rendition steve miller " abracadabra " . , they've got some nice softer tunes form " ode lonely hearted " " even though " ( song which seems jumped off time machine 50 or something ... good stuff ) . , course there bits pieces trademark sugar ray humor thrown album . like they always say , sugar ray all fun . period . if things like " image " matter you , then steer clear this band . if dogmatic adherence one specific style music ( only one specific style music ) excites you then steer clear this band . but , if you like fun your music ( a.k.a. enjoying it ) if you appreciate diverse musical influences , then here ya ' go	1
avid ib fan ... i say , hell this album . this far worst pile garbage band ever put out . erik braunn million times guitar player pinera or rhino ... i'm saying braunn praise , not either latters ' detriment , they're both great . but songs unimaginitive it clear where most fire previous albums came ... 17 year old who booted out too many creative ideas his own . ib owed atlantic album after this one , but doug ingle quit band forefitted deal ... forever severing ties iron butterfly atlantic records . but considering what pile crap this album , fact they didn't follow it up should seen mercy . so , conclusion , screw this one , go get copy ball or live	-1
this box set seeks recapture magic first motown box set while it delivers great music , it doesn't quite live up its predecesor . first box defined time . motown called " sound young america " heard music . joyful , questioning , urgent , fun , pleading . 60 first box set . second set suffers fact motown not big music force 70 . music not vitality earlier decade . said , it contain some marvelous music . first 2 discs especially . motown lives this box , just not robustly it earlier one . i would recommend it , but i don't think it occupy much your time first box set . it note worthy some one hit wonders included ( like berry gordy own son who went under moniker " rockwell " ) . fun but not memorable collection	1

some critics panned this 1961 session mr. blakey jazz messengers , feeling album lacks punch such classic blakey lp like ' moanin ' or ' night tunisia ' ( blue note records version ) . this set more laid-back , blakey band , emphasizing groove over hardbop fury . but not say this album not good , though . mr. blakey gift bringing together great bands young musicians forging solid unit out them . this version featured outstanding horns lee morgan ( trumpet ) , wayne shorter ( tenor sax ) , curtis fuller ( trombone ) . mr. morgan takes quiet approach his soloing ( eg ., quot;don't you know what love isquot ;) wonderful . mr. shorter gives us glimpses things come his own blue note sessions ( eg ., ' juju ' ' night dreamer ' ) . other highlights opening quot ; alamodequot ; quot ; i hear rhapsodyquot ; . nice introduction mr. blakey , or hear more groove oriented messengers set , try this album	1

thing i like best this album exotic moods grooves this album . there everything moroccan african jamaican whole lot more . i listen this album all its different styles never tire it . some people seem think too many styles music make disjointed record , i disagree i think it keeps music interesting . it hard believe only two guys made all this cool music . emiliana torrini vocals add nice sound tracks she appears , but my favorites would more reggae type tracks . one my favorite albums moment	1

" how you resist it " little bit country rock rolled into one . it oddball out whole album this nothing like teena ever before . first i didn't like this song but it grew me . great guitar work some interesting word usage ( sorry , i'm english/writing buff ) . " since day one " showcases early 90 slow jam some good percussion work well driving laidback kinda vibe much like " cupid " " just us two " . " miracles need wings fly " hidden gem teena belting it out once more , very beautiful lyrics reggae-ish " red zone " shows teena doing her own turn doing " state world " song hence singers like marvin gaye janet jackson , name few . very inspiring lyrics make you actually ... think ! unlike today mindless crap ( exceptions alicia keys , jill scott , mary . blige blu cantrell just name few) " ivory " outstanding album , one teena best i declare , it i stated my title , poetry motion . lyrics this album some teena best it just one few albums i listen all way not skip any songs . funky , inspirational lovley journey i lady this cd . add it your collection take trip " ivory " ! star sprinkles top 51 . just us two2 . snap your fingers3 . if i bell4 . cupid real straight shooter5 . how you resist it ? actually ... whole freakin ' album good	1

there only two ways someone could not like this album : 1 . he/she lacks capacity feel emotion ie no soul . 2 . he/she deaf . while there too many great blues albums hail one greatest , i could not argue anyone thinking this peak blues . whether you blues fan or not , this album such emotion such power it transcends musical taste . musicianship , perhaps most notably guitar playing , fabulous sam ' vocals breathtaking ; he voice angel fire , meaning sweet lovely but edgy intense . music just doesn't get much better than this . i highly recommend it anyone considers his/herself fan music , partiuclarly blues , jazz , rock , or soul	1
i purchased this cd my daughter . she college age really enjoying it . it arrived quickly good condition	1
terrible , i gotten this cd high hopes because their single " we used friends " , but this cd just lacks much creative beat or rhythem or anything . it sounds like someone who morbidly depressed just singing sighs , " lalala ...... sigh .... all us ..... " i not find one song whole cd i liked , which surprising because i think their other cd pretty decent . hardcore fans may like it , but i wouldn't spend your money it . try getting it library test-driving it . i don't think you like it though .	-1
this release shows attacking krs-one blazing controversial lyrical content . why this album so slept not noticed mystery . this cd definitely worth picking up includes very tight beats	1

doc watson one premier flatpick guitar players ever , some his best albums recorded his late son merle . sittin ' here pickin ' blues draws three early mid-eighties studio albums they recorded flying fish ( one live track telluride festival tapes ) . here breakdown tracks : red rocking chair ( 1981 ): " california blues , " " you hear john hurt , " " any old time " " how long blues . " . michael coleman plays bass all tracks tom scott plays clarinet " any old time . " doc merle watson guitar album ( 1983 ): " talking casey , " " goin ' chicago blues " " john henry/worried blues . " . michael coleman plays bass all tracks mark o'connor plays fiddle . telluride festival tapes ( 1984 ): " deep river blues " pickin ' blues ( 1985 ): all twelve tracks original vinyl release included . . michael coleman plays bass all tracks sam bush plays mandolin or fiddle many ( except " st. louis blues " which doc plays solo ) . not only doc accomplished guitar player , but his son merle more than holds his own slide guitar most these tracks . my only complaint individual albums currently out print more than dozen tracks red rockin ' chair guitar album left off . this should double cd enable all three cds included their entirety . but if you're looking solid introduction music doc merle , this excellent place start . [ running time - 60:05 ] very highly recommende	1

when i first bought this vinyl some twenty years ago , i not too impressed it . i'm not sure why . maybe it because i loved ' phenomenon ' so much disappointed it didn't sound more like album . maybe it because most songs didn't catch first listen . maybe it song titles , which i don't think rank amongst their best . whatever case , i remember not liking it much foolishly traded it away . some twenty years later , i bought this cd now realize how wrong i first this album . yeah , songs not immediately likable tunes ' phenomenon ' high points aren't high , but taken it own terms , this great album . tunes didn't catch my ear first , like two opening hard rockers , ' let it roll ' ' shoot shoot ' , i now absolutely love tunes i liked first time around , such ballad ' high flyer ' crunchy hard rocker ' mother mary ' , i like even more now . this certainly more aggressive heavier album than it predecessor , but it also more diverse terms material . keyboards , courtesy ten years after keyboardist chick churchill , make their first appearance ufo album definitely add , opposed subtract , overall sound . keyboards their most effective album closing track , ' this kid ( including ' walls ' ) , particularly during last two half minutes . moment , this my favorite song album . it fades out some mournful sounding church ( or ' churchill ' ! ) organ , leaving me wanting more , which nice way end album . catchy guitar riffs , singalongable vocal melodies guitar solos abundance throughout album , even what i think some album weaker cuts such ' dance your life away ' ' love lost love ' . oh yes , i almost forgot mention pete way ' too much nothing ' , which very early alice cooper-like bass drum section middle . oh yes .. again .. i like andy parker very solid drumming ' shoot shoot ' . see , there bunch like ' force it ' ! you should buy it	1
bottom line - mr. marsalis company delivered exceptional disc baroque treasures trumpet . it obvious urtext approach not taken , but i think fine . anthony newman added some obbligato parts ( timpani , organ , etc ) apparently notated tutti ornaments strings majority pieces this collection . incidentally , bach only substantial work disc ( my reasoning 4 stars lieu 5 ) . it bach marsalis shows why he become such world-class artist . now , i am very aware he uses modern schilke piccolo this recording play rather loud , i love it ! he produces beautiful sound throughout tend steal spotlight . william bennett flute falls victim faintly heard times . neil black , great oboist , embellishes his passages way i not previously heard . english chamber orchestra provides lush accompaniment throughout . bach purists most likely discount this interpretation terms balance but cannot dispute its character virtuosity execution . my only complaint throughout choice repertoire . music ends up sounding like same story told over over again , but well told	1

sam first rate . if you like buddy guy you might like sam . if you like otis rush , you almost certainly like sam . if you like good music soul , rythm feeling- this it . not too much production , not stripped down either . it happy medium most blues fans . there isn't overboard horn section or interfering keys , or crazy looped guitar tracks . this pure taste . piano plays perfectly music [ sam learned west side soul only play best . ] one tenor saxaphone few tracks add some layers . sam plays lead some extra rythm . he only vocalist . there two tunes kinda soul/ . rest solid blues , sometimes funky , sometimes slow . sam one great blues singers innovators . this record happy medium lot respects . you got instrumental . you got guitar playing technically respectable creative but totally tasteful feel music . sam doesn't drill over music confused lines go no where particular like alot bluesmen tend . he plays his band . he solos he shines , but he doesn't ever mess up sound songs . its got slow soul , feel good , funk , everything . this album west side soul sam his peek , cream electric blues players . man all around innovator blues music , live he played bass , drums , harmonica , piano or whatever band needed , it didn't matter . he pushed cool blues ahead . he otis rush changed game . sam respect otis because he his songs , like keep loving me here my love never die west side . i tell everybody i know who likes good music- if you don't know this guy , then you missing big piece puzzle . this where it . his two major studio records only real studio lps two my favorites out hundreds albums . i can't even see how anyone could not like this	1
okay , i'm vu nutcase - must said . i bought all four their original studio albums three-week span , if you wanted any proof . i also like reed solo stuff , this great record . wonderfully twisted walk wild side lou only top 40 hit , indeed it quite song . but don't , some , overlook rockers such vicious or hangin ' ' round , satellite love ( featuring david bowie , who produced record , singing great backup vocal ); slightly overblown but still good ballad perfect day ; bizarre andy chest , which lot fun ; or hilarious new york telephone conversation . wagon wheel , i'm so free goodnight ladies weak , but overall transformer excellent record . okay , i'll admit i miss reed expiremental edge ( it interesting david bowie , man behind excellent station station album , didn't tap into ) , i said before couple songs weak . but hey , it great , sure better than overrated rock ' ' roll animal	1
young , first uk pop idol winner , gone strenght strength !!! after rather disapointing debut album he came back his second taking uk charts storm again again then vanishing !!!! but now , 2 years later , he back this latest album fantastic ! full great pop tunes great love songs , this great album playing around house relax or work . expected there some fab lyrics some reministant his last albums best song ' leave right now ' which worth checking out . highlights include unashamedly poppy ' switch it ' which great dance sing , heart rending ' all time love ' fanstasticly simple understated ballad we all relate some point our lives ..... " sometimes you pass good ones , cos you're trying too hard , too hard see them " tust me , give this album chance , you wont regret it	1
course this not ground-breaking band featured lester young basie rhythm section late 30s , but it great band , more power drive than band , just much swing . i really say ? power comes abigger band better recording techniques . lockjaw davis presence wonderful . whirlybird flight foobirds super cuts . this not first basie disk you should buy , but it #6 , since #1 -4 ( three disk set basie decca vols . 1 , 2 , 3 columbia ) my top 10 jazz disks overall , this high recommendation . best jazz issue basie superb way , if you only want buy one	1

truly great art/punk album , their darkest best work . some humour earlier recordings missing , although no album whose first song starts line : quot ; hands up ! who wants diequot ; . could called humourless . it would worth five stars except some weaker songs like six strings drew blood pleasure avalanche but both these not orginal lps so it not birthday partys fault . great album violent , rocking tottaly amoral just way i like em	1
truth told excellent album . powerfull mostly new . bastardos same qualitys . very first track you sense blues traveler ( now ) going new directions every album song . thats whats so incredible this long time band . they keep recreating themselves every second play together . we might miss mister bob sheehan but we sure love what blues traveler without him . maybe long time fans not happy this new albums ( tbt bastardos ) but can't say blues traveler not good before . i believe not better , i believe its just simple evolution . great one . this 70 rock influenced album solid record must considered one best album this year . i haven't listen like this one honest . songs like " you can't stop thinking abou me " or " can't win true love " shows evolution band not forgotten their old influences , they just add new ones . ( thanks tad kinchla ben wilson ) . they playing excellent live shows i believe this album shows band going better places . but they sure deliver us better albums , but this great attemp say " hey , we still alive better than ever " .	1

play , start , classic . i think tracks overall great arranged professionally , but also each track listened individually you still get same feeling ! 1 . honey - this top song catchy beat , i seem able listen it over over again . ( this song gets even better 118 remix single)2 . find my baby - i never used like this song , but now i think its great . my first impressions repetetive boring , but if you listen carefully appreciate song , it become favourite ! 3 . porcelain - my favourite song off album ! beautifully arranged , its gorgeous song ! if you've heard music album " animal rights " or " everything wrong " then its not what you'd expect moby , but great track . 4 . why my heart - brilliant :) simple piano pattern , blues vocals minor melody make it song you listen anytime , when your peaceful , upset , even when your just relaxing . 5 . south side - it good song , but i think gwen stefani singing takes away originality . 6 . rushing - not great but it fits atmosphere album . 7 . bodyrock - now this good song . not moby all , but damn its catchy :) 8 . natural blues - this song means alot people who appreciate good blues music . me =] 9 . machete - nice basic techno-ish beat . 10 . 7 - skip it , you wouldn't notice . although i used this cassette it first track side , which made good intro . 11 . run - i wouldn't clue what guy saying , i'm too lazy look up lyrics but its good song . i don't know why they released extended version , i think its long enough . 12 . down slow - skip this one too . or fast forward it tape = p13 . if things perfect - yeaah its okay ... 14 . everloving - my second favourite song this album !!! it so well , it starts nice acoustic builds up what soudns full symphony orchestra or somethin like . 15 . inside - not big fan but its near end cd , where its winding down . 16 - , - wow this surprisingly good song . i never used like it but i now . 17 - sky broken - sort haunting way , but still . 18 - i don't really like this track , but its perfect album closer . also , if youve seen new live hotel tour dvd , its opening sequence , which good start great concert . well theirs my extra long review . hope you read it all didnt skip boring bits like i this cd . : pby	1

i admit , i sceptical when this cd first handed me . " yes " i am firm believer some material should not covered - like " take five " example . no variation , improvisation , or arrangement could ever reach heights original . i put " love supreme " category well ... until i heard wynton brother branford live recording " love supreme " , released late 2004 . so wynton under quite some pressure deliver ... here my ten cents : i love this cd . fact , i am listening it over over again , always discovering new nuances marsalis ' smart big band arrangements . he leaves enough space each musician - including himself - show their artistic talents while never losing cohesiveness needed make this production work . it treat jazz-loving ear . appropriately challenging , yet flowing fresh . there ellingtonian grandeur recording wynton marsalis ' classcial music training certainly came handy here . incidentally , " love supreme " produced yet member marsalis family , brother delfeayo .	1

this my very first electronic cd . i picked it up local record store impulse , didn't expect much . first listen , it seemed somewhat pretentious , indulgent , artsy ... this my idea trance music general time . fact , i bought this album challenge myself : i wanted give every style music fair chance . after my 30 second scan each track , i left it alone until one fateful night . my friend ricky pulled out some nifty little toys called glowsticks ! he told me he learning how make interesting light shows out them , but only " techno " music he horrible mix tape featuring likes alice deejay , t-99 , other outdated rave-monkey acts . i shuddered every track rediculous synths over-enhanced basslines . so he noticed my copy " world " sitting my cd tower , suggested we try it . i overwhelmed difference it made play this album ricky 6,000 -dollar home stereo . i simply blown away darkly hypnotic , playfully dreamy sounds coming out speakers . i picked up glowsticks my first time i created something beautiful out this mix . now , 6 years later , i still keep coming back this mix whenever i need unwind . seriously , almost every single track here my list favorites . however , two really stand out me most north sky tears rain . i still whistle melody vangelis song my baby nephew lullaby , he loves it . summing it all up : these some most intense , uplifting , soulful pieces music i ever experienced . if you patient ear , active mind ... you enjoy this mix	1

chris , i love this album so many reasons ! not sure i put it all into words but here few : your lyrics deep give me things think they stir my spirit way makes me want draw closer god ( i know mean lot things lot people but i don't know how else word it ) . i love passion emotion you put into each song . it obvious every song genuine comes your heart . i found myself gravitating towards artists who write their own music because there so much more meaning behind it instead just fun song you like maybe first 20 times you hear it then toss it aside because it didn't impact your heart . make sense ? musically , i think this album excellent ! i love no two songs sound same . i love there lot layers songs ... i listen them over over different things stand out me i didn't notice before . i feel like there so much inside me responds your music - things go way deeper than words speak . it hard wrap my mind around it . i think big part could because it artistry , musicianship , spirit , soul , passion all intertwined together it affects me so many different levels -yet all once - it something marveled enjoyed beauty it unveils . i metioned this you your blog couple times , but i want say thank you again making such incredible music sharing it us .	1

i bought this cd already familiar dance/trance/techno scene years , listened few times never picked it up again . i picked up this cd since it tilt - i dream ( resurection remix ) - ( which only track carries captivating beat - truly awesome ) thinking rest cd would just incredible . unless your gonna get sloshed or shoot up something freak dance strobe lights amist booming sound system , don't waste your money this one . until i personally decide this myself , only then would i rate this five . sasha must better mixes out there i not yet discovered , but whatever case , this cd disappointment . rather than letting this cd uselessly spin my cd deck , i simply use it coaster . i know many disagree this review but given fact i gave this cd honest shot , i not writing this hater . i simply not impressed this one . this mix carries same monotonous beat start finish . honestly , there better mixes out there sasha ... but don't waste your ears this one . if you liked other cds like : trance mix usa , bt - movement still life , atb - dj mix , crystal method - vegas community service , any mixes dj micro , tansport paul oakenfold , dj tiesto search sunrise , or any gatecrasher mix .... this cd may not one you	-1
i love this album . i'm one relative few who bought it when it first came out 1976 . but they really shouldn't messed it when they decided release remastered version . yes , i love orson welles narration they added , but new guitar parts really annoy me . anyone who listened endlessly original lp , new guitar parts sound very 80 stand out bad way . i wish people would learn leave well enough alone . other than cheesy guitar parts ( final , totally boring , song ) , it classic album . it too bad app went commercial their next lp , but it happens best them	1
when i first heard this album i hated it . lil john new up beat flaver this album threw me off . im use melodic thug sound krayzie this album little more mainstream type beats . krayzie still always my favorite member btnh , after dissapointing thug da line album ( mostly due poor guest artists ) this album pretty good . few best songs end early though . best song album " dont know why " , incredible but it ends right when story reaches its peak . get cha twisted very good well . more sentimental songs this album good . my favorite those " i remember " which talks all days he remembers chillin other members btnh . overall , its good album but keep open mind new type beats displayed this album	1

artie shaw , still alive kicking ( age 91 , born 23 may , 1910 ) this writing , perhaps most brilliantly intellectual all great big band leaders . genius whose moody , perfectionist personality won him beautiful wives such lana turner ava gardner , shaw my favourite leader fabled big band era . his 1936 orchestra included strings which highly unusual jazz band those days ; his version quot ; japanese sandmanquot ; instance surprisingly very good . artie 1937 orchestra , my opinion just awful . horrible . tinny , screechy musically inept ; he trying too hard , i suspect . teen-ager , i owned his ' 37 recordings quot ; night dayquot ; quot ; non-stop flightquot ; ( his 1938 version this instrumental opus which he wrote himself terrific ! ) quot ; i surrender , dearquot ; among others . early 1938 , however , artie re-organized his band it band which remains public favourite : quot ; begin beguinequot ; flip side record which bigger seller : quot ; indian love callquot ; . one night late 1939 , while performing audience bandstand , artie simply took off headed mexico vowing never return music business . shaw re-appeared several months later ( he actually sick rare disease ) brand-new 31 piece orchestra which included string section flutes ; quot ; frenesiquot ; introduced ecstatic response artie back rare form . personally , i liked string studded band even more than his great ' 38 band because it more demension . quot ; frenesiquot ; quot ; temptationquot ; quot ; star dustquot ; his classic interpretation quot ; moonglowquot ; solid gold . ( listen part where piano meets jack jenney trombone solo quot ; moonglowquot ; you'll discover where they got idea quot ; moonglow theme picnicquot ; some 15 years later	1

if you've made it this far dictators fan , shame you even needing review convince you buy this ! you hesitating because price ? how much you spent dictators albums last 25 years ? maybe you're hesitating because you're concerned terrible sound or lousy performance . well , sound suberb ( great production job shernoff ) performance flat out rocks . ( i'd like add ..... this not ipod music . this 200 watts channel least 10 " woofers move some serious air music ) . major bonus here killer versions " go girl crazy " songs . even remastered version studio album leaves much diesired . songs this live album finally those 25 year old tracks justice . satisfied ? so add it cart now or go zshops save few cents . if you've made it this far curiosity your music collection lacking dictator department , this album album get . " viva ! " great representation what this band all . after one listen you'll adding all studio releases your collection fairly quickly . i only few minor " issues " bring up . so , if you not fan band already , just skip my ranting below , buy cd come back read this later . ok ? below may considered blasphemy i may burn it . but i need get them off . only beef i sound imbalance guitar mix . ross guitar right channel set " 10 " while top ten guitar left channel set " 7 " ; this very picky , long time fans criticism . second , this not true live album per se rather than collection live songs . songs put together very little song chatter audience participation . some songs actually fade out silence . all this gives album more " live studio " than audience live recording feel . last song " cars girls " recorded audience free sound check sounds no different than rest album . i really hoping hear few song sermons manitoba it not . lastly , no music " manifest destiny " . this may contractual issue however not oversight band . but one thing overshadow all my nitpicking ross boss . if you all albums vinyl , then you know where i'm coming . ross playing here blends ferocity stooges james williamson melodic playing " buck dharma " little bit ace frehley thrown . he never , never , never , never , never sounded better . that it ....	1

first - " root down " hottest rawest down-to-earth funkadelic live album recorded jimmy smith his most unusual live group ' 70 . secondly - he never follow up album concept . too bad ! recorded live los angeles february 1972 , group young musicians rooted modern progressive rock/jazzrock funk seems no respect organ master pushes him beyond normal limits . wilton felder ( yes , man crusaders ) plays his funky elbass , some guitar distortion/wah-wah artur adams funky drumming paul humphrey , band sounds astonishing modern acid jazz vein , even today standards . smith kicks off laying down blues drenched organ grooves truly cook his originals like " sagg shootin ' his arrow " , " root down " slow down sagg " . too often played " after hours " sounds fresh new adding steve williams harmonica . reissue even greater than original album since verve restored original tracks their full unedited length ... great work verve	1
please stop letting yourself brainwashed this macho hypocricy . large part street punk oi ! just something racist , scared white people hide behind . singing wearing boots beating up people who you outnumber not make you special , it just makes you hateful narrow-minded authorities you oppose . if you really want tough , save whales . this band government music , big time labels prefer these hateful bands because they make punks look like bunch scary degenerates , because they convince some teenagers fight middle east . think what you're doing if you choose buy this cd ; you really think 30 years you say " i am happy i became such moron beat up all my neighbors . "	-1
when paul westerberg good , he unmatched any songwriter out there these days . he capable writing amazing pop songs , great rock roll wonderful ballads . he also become consistantly inconsistent his solo work this batch songs poor examples his potential . only " right arm bears " seems worthy release high profile soundtrack geared kids , while other tracks sound too familiar these ears , relying tired riffs borrowed melodies , sounding too mature kids audiance too uninspired adults who still care . apparently paul considered grammy song " i belong " which could blessing or curse our old boy . he deserves recongition his great songwriting career he certainly deserves get " real paid " after all this time , but he then joining company other grammy winners writing lukewarm drivel masses . i highly disappointed this collection songs it one very few pw releases i cannot recommend	-1
not sure how i moved give mutemath try , but they're my current favorite . i saw them open fray last night - i believe they stole show . awesome live band . most talented ( entertaining ) drummer i've seen years . great vocals , very original sound .	1
mastodon-blood mountain ***** metal back , real metal finally returned so vengeance . more then just metal this one album knows no bound , reaching into progressive rock , classic rock , thrash , just straight up rock roll . attitude when needed unparalleled any other band around right now , moments sensitivity fantastically balanced intensity . brann dailor plays some best drums you ever heard your entire life blood mountain , fervor mans kit insane . troy sanders lays down some fattest bass lines i've ever heard , also some intensest vocals metal history . guitars played brent hinds bill kelliher most creative guitar playing genre seen almost fifteen years it so refreshing hear . lyrical matter album very early slayer but much more sophisticated . story band parking bottom blood mountain attempting climb top reach crystal skull before they catch frostbite ate sleeping giant , cysquatch . if sounds insane you like one most off wall premises album then you wouldn't far off , either you never heard real metal album before . songs like incendiary `the wolf loose ' which opens album capillarian crest ' provide what metal missing last few years ( exception trivium , lamb god ) , balls . album opener easily best song mastodon ever written recorded . slower more melodic tracks like brilliant `bladecatcher ' beautiful(yes beautiful yet brutal ) album closer `pendulous skin ' so there more mastodon then your face-destructive metal , much more . complicated rhythms this album show musical prowess each players this none more present then `circle cysquatch .

my wife i heard cut radio immediately moved . stunningly beautiful . healing . hauntingly spiritual . lisbeth scott voice speaks my soul evoke its peace	1
i picked this up cd after i listened band earlier releases , quot ; raincoatsquot ; , quot ; odyshapequot ; , quot ; movingquot ; quot ; kitchen tapesquot ;; it didn't impress me . note absence vicky aspinell , who i feel essential part raincoats their early years . gal voices don't sound great they their previous albums . gina voice grated my nerves after first track . last two tracks back day . raincoats ' classics ! i would say , pick this one up after you listened their earlier releases . maybe then you'll share similar opinion	-1

this one michael kamen best . it adventurous , romantic , fun all rolled into one . main theme titled quot ; overturequot ; classic main theme actually music morgan creek pictures logo . it big colossal wonderous brass fanfares top notch string performances . score contains lots variations this theme throughout . quot ; sir guy gisbornequot ; contains light bouncy woodwinds , leading quot ; escape sherwoodquot ; quotes main theme some great percussion work . quot ; little johnquot ; slightly amusing cue , leading quot ; band forestquot ; , which militaristic like march . quot ; sheriff his witchquot ; dark ominous nature . quot ; marianquot ; , well quot ; marian waterfallquot ; contain beautiful romantic theme played mainly flutes gentle strings harp . it also melody outstanding bryan adams song heard toward end . quot ; abduction final battle gallowsquot ; starts out ominous sounding strings piccolo , few guitars , leading rumbling percussion solo , finally heading toward exciting action cue powerful horn sounds top notch brass fanfares . quot ;( everything i ) i it youquot ; one my favorite songs hit top charts years ago still top requested song because it good . quot ; wild timesquot ; decent song performed jeff lange , but not even close how good other song . this highly recommended soundtrack if you haven't guessed now	1
course no album perfect , but purity which mr. newman music comes through these interpretations riveting . " i think it going rain today " alone worth price album . william merrill wrote his spotlight review , songwriting takes center stage . if , like me , you've not randy newman solo concert , least we've got this album bring songwriting alive us	1
this particular version js bach " goldberg " variations really should require no review all ; anyone even remotely interested this kind music should already know it . it j.s. bach -- undisputed all time master contrapuntal fugue form -- peak his compositional skills , interpreted glenn gould - keyboard genius without parallel - perhaps greatest classical piano virtuoso history human race . track track what you here quite literally most thrilling intricate baroque era single clavinette music ever written . fact it generally understood only reason goldberg variations not heard often bach signature work , far more famous " well tempered clavinette " collection , simply because there so few people around level skill necessary perform them . give extremely high marks gould then , because this recording replete rivers sizzling notes moving flawlessly all directions blinding speeds ... speeds times too hard even process through human ear much less play ! one almost picture him keyboard , eyes closed , head cocked bowed way over , both hands " flying " up down keyboard performing their simultaneously complex scales counter-scales astonishing amount intensity almost un-human , precision-like perfection . there 30 goldberg variations ( not counting two arias open close which illustrative ) , each variant containing two four voices , each characterized canons other repeated sections , but really interesting twist this production you get 2 recordings same set variations ; one gould his brilliant 1955 recording debut- one created sensation which landed him cover time magazine time , second gould 1981 just days before he died , back studio performing same set same exact order . even fact much this paricular collection old analogue recording gear ( circa 1955 ) adds its pure delight , tape giving back true depth , clear spatial definition , good old stereo separation taken away this less personal " digital " era which we currently live record . so it all makes amazing experience , truly so . i say : buy it , buy it , buy it --- even if you're low money -- buy it ! even if you're " baroque " -- buy it	1
this very good cd some very strong tracks1 . three chords country- very good song cd version better then radio version steve tyler but very good song2 . podunk- good song guy lived small town valled podunk moved away there but end goes back his hometown3 . wrapped around- very good song probley one 4 prime cuts this album4 . xxl- just great song people big love this song prime cut number 25 . pickin wildflowers-very good upbeat song also prime cut6 . everytime i hear your name- great song guy can't get woman off his mind7 . stick it- love this song it very fun song listen too sing too 8 . plan b-good song guys who tries get girl but don't work so he needs plan b9 . lazy your love- this good song but i think weakest song album10 . clothes don't make man- great song guy jail but not bad guy because clothes don't make man11 . you'll know when i get there- i think best song album should single but my view best song albumso overall i give this album 4.75 stars but because i can't put i give it	1
this expanded edition what already classic blues album . all all expanded edition ok . it remastered george marino , who remastered lot catalogs , most importantly led zeppelin catalog . this edition sounds little better than old cd , but not much . two extra tracks really outstanding . one instrumental jam where buddy really lets loose other nice cover guitar slim . no horns or big production , just buddy band these two . big letdown : ' mustang sally ' jeff beck contribution edited out completely !!! all fills his solo . why , what happened ??	1
i agree this show fabulous . i am often london business never able get tix until this summer . what treat ! i am huge broadway fan this show right up there best . cd , it very good really takes me right back theatre . strongest numbers include : electricity , letter , expressing yourself merry xmas maggie thatcher ( i wonder what they'll w/that one when show comes new york ) . don't buy cd until you've seen show - you enjoy it much more way	1
phrase i've seen time or two reference james brown little richard suggests they forgiven their egotism because their music lives up boasts . thought came mind after ingesting this cd " teacher " krs-one boogie down productions . those who suggest this disc musical propaganda correct . kris parker general message here police not trusted , educational system failing pass achievements black americans past african culture , sometimes black man only friend his firearm . he uses intense vocal delivery while musically smooth rhythms take some edge off bitter pill . reggae flavors turn up often , most pronounced ( ironically enough ) " hip hop rules " . group also make time nod beat box sound " breath control " . highlights : scratched hook " jack spades " relentless . ever wonder where origins " throw your hands air " ? check rhyme ... parker sister pamela " harmony " scott turns nicely soulful vocal spiritual paean " jah rulez " . ( " what they ? /what they say ? /they can't live without your love/another day ... " ) " who protects us you ? " aims police brutality , questioning whether quality protection varies class . ( " it seems when you walk ghetto/you walk your own point view ... " ) " you must learn " indicts educational establishment failure teach achievements forebears like benjamin banneker ( creator almanac ) granville woods ( inventor walkie-talkie ) . it not just young blacks who miss out here . ( " when one doesn't know other one culture/ignorance swoops down like vulture .. " ) gangsta rap template " bo ! bo ! bo ! " catchy , if not more than little disingenuous disc also includes " world peace " logo " stop violence " movement . lows : " world peace " simultaneously musically catchy lyrically vapid . " if we really want world peace/and we want it right now/we must make up our mind take it .. " answer according parker but doesn't take into account fact many world conflicts based deep seated religious or ethnic divisions won't go away just because " positivity " . bottom line : you take some " education " here grain salt . but there no doubt all krs ' skill mic . he absolutely defines foundations old school hip-hop this album one rap cornerstones . recommended	1
you learn everything how make record this album . care precision put into this record present everywhere . handful songs simply amazing , but even less than stellar songs every note arrangements purpose . during time when most singer/songwriters just worrying " message " newman concerned music . it shows . then there songs , mordant ones any rate , which just plain brilliant . this intelligent pop music new orleans stylings thick thread reaches back piano based ballads people like fats waller . newman american original .	1
this album combines exceptional , interesting , stylistically disparate tunes , luscious electronic orchestration , unrelenting drive uncanny sense artistic unity . it " dance album " pretty much class itself . leftfield , before disbanding , also created formidable body ep releases remixes . their second album , rhythm stealth , also full shimmeringly beautiful cuts - though without unifying " comet ride " impulse this album easy acceptance often greets familiar - case leftism , it comfortable place dance bin . repeat : if you like hard-driving dance music glorious electronica , this truly distinguished disk	1
my husband i literally wearing out this terrific cd ! rich blend celtic english ... songs known unknown . this celtic enthusiasts everywhere	1
... i went school not far dayton when this came out . thankfully , it one those you play all track one end . it ended up helping me through many evening studying dorm room ... music , .. although cover didn't hurt none . i also remember those friday night student union parties where they played heck outta quot ; firequot ; quot ; smokequot ; slowgrind jams quot ; togetherquot ; quot;it all overquot ; . what i say , but quot ; throw some water mequot ; ... call firemen ! after i graduated school moved dayton , i lived apartment complex not too far both troutman labs one story storefront warehouse where they practiced when they town . anyway , i got meet billy beck , diamond sugarfoot ... they weren't all impressed me , but i thought they great their musicianlike moodiness ... they sure could play funky music . i miss kinda group around ..	1
it exactly what i looking . i love cd	1
i didn't buy this album . i downloaded several songs . it produced suge mostly new material . songs boring though . only classic " until end time " . don't buy this album . just download songs you like	-1
i don't know exactly how classify this band . nu-metal ? i don't think term really applies so much heavy music scene anymore . i would say they would alternative metal , not emo or nu . first off , vocals just amazing . not only leads , but backing vocs harmonies excellent . haven't heard better since maybe alice chains . every song here worthy single , i think if they got proper backing , they could huge . there hooks galore . i think i almost od'd catchy tunes . there few tender moments this disc , but it rocks pretty hard while keeping true melody it title . if you enjoy bands like taproot , 10 years , godhead , etc ., you'll love evans blue . no , they not hardcore or anything , but i'm not ashamed i like broad range rock metal . i listen lamb god flames , too . i appreciate great music when i hear it , these guys great .	1
i reviewed debut , i review all her cd chronogically . so this leads us 5 000 000 selling us , one #1 hit . following self-titled album , its success kind disappointing , although it still very succesful . it probably mariah album i listen least . emotions : only #1 hit , first single , instantly catchy early 90 dance track . who doesn't remember this ? but i like way i feel , insiiiiiide!' infamous high notes , belting , this one mariah best songs vocally . some say ' oversinging ' , but it ok my taste . 10/10and you don't remember : my favorite song record . many fans dislike it , but slow haunting verses mixed direct heartfelt chorus really it me . not mention endless high note . it very sad song , i relate . 10/10can't let go : probably my 2nd favorite . it stuck #2 billboard charts . it little faster than aydr but it still slow ballad . it catchy chorus beautiful vocals . once again , endless high note . goes 16 seconds if i remember correctly . even though i try , i can't let go ... 10/10make it happen : clearly one mariah favorite songs hers , she sings it every occasion . catchy uptempo beat , powerful vocals make it amazing song dance . plus , lyrics so uplifting , i can't think better song listen cheer you up . 3rd single album , it hit #5 billboard charts . 10/10if it over : one most powerful songs off record . when mariah sung this back day , you couldn't help but get chills all over ... it isn't fair , it isn't right , if it really gone , then tell me tonight ... if it over ... melody also haunting . 10/10you're so cold : amazing intro first thing i mention . vocals just astonishing . i left speachless after slow intro ... but then beat comes . it my favorite upbeat song record . it really catchy piano beat different . she asking why he so cold . 10/10so blessed : favorite amongst listeners , although it never really stood out me . it good , but i don't see huge appeal . it slow song very romantic lyrics . 7/10to around you : last upbeat song album . it not good 3 first ones , but it really good its own right . it picks up pace last song it keeps album interesting , short it . 9/10till end time : i never liked this song ... it slow boring me . i'll give it chance grow me but til end , it my least favorite song mariah carey . 5/10the wind : beautiful hauting somewhat jazz feel song . it very depressing , mourning loss . ends album beautifully 8/10this album released year i born . i love it nevertheless i'm happy i'm not missing out mariah older stuff . you've got me feeling emotions ... deeper than i've ever dreamed ofoh , oh , ohyou've got me feeling emotions ... higher than heavens aboveyou got me feeling higher ..	1
his long career hassell created very personal sound , not only his trumpet but all his ensembles he bring direction he likes . maybe this not one his best cd but few seconds you easily recognize his music different any other musician . while other similar artists like eno making musical flops ( listen day ... ) hassell continues his artistic journey no compromises we grateful him	1

i saw them live , i all original lp i watched 1968 concert bbc . this offering far removed way i remember them . all cream same age i am , it showed . poor jack recovering surgery lost voice stamina . ginger subdued but who would expected him still alive . eric , well he just going through motions . but biggest criticism , mentioned others , clapton using strat ' instead les paul gibson . they just didn't sound right . said this , it cream i bought cd anyway	-1
like companion set , hittin ' all six ( jazz guitar ) , this collection brings together wide range excellent records date earliest jazz recordings going up though early modern . some selections predictable , some obscure , but they all interesting . lots sid catlett , example , excellent choices big band side particular ( cozy cole , jimmy crawford jo jones , name three ) . no lionel hampton , but fabulous cymbal beat alvin burroughs hampton small group . course , chick webb liza , which features wonderful drumming but also really fine trumpet solo bobby stark ( 2nd solo )	1
i love neil diamond but this album left me very unhappy . i think i found one song i enjoyed . i don't recommend it all .	-1
i didn't time go watch film .... i bought cd , few weeks ago .... " blindfold " , because i'm conviced so far , asian composers doing terrific job , when they composing music films . what i'm trying say ... scores like ... 7 swords , fearless , crouching tiger-hidden dragon , hero house flying daggers , very high dose ofthat " magic exotic " , music scale far-eastern music ! ( music scale progression notes specific order ) . score becomes " sonic explosive " additional touch epic music-structure . this " mixture " also contains , great chorals great solo china-flute " passages " live flute master-player ...... or it japanese " shakuhachi " ??? great china-gongs , drums all over final result .... simply amazing ! we used western world , hear scores sound almost alike . it because western composers , no more " ideas " ? i don't know what wrong , but one thing sure ..... trust asian composers ! buy this cd!it excellent lot china " flavor " !!! big bravo composer ! ps : please read comments below ..... way .... many thanks eriko kawahara . i informed my eriko kawahara composer japanese !!	1

this definetly their best album so far ! epic orchestral usual but unusually voice singer fabio lione , triumph or agony powerful then ever this time they have'nt become much orchestral , so if you consider last album stop buy rhapsody`s albums - " triumph or agony " fresh must . listen first reviewer - " this album totally blows away all expectations "	1
if you like stuff like depeche mode , thompson twins , erasure , naked eyes , human league talk talk than you enjoy this great forgotten band too . they obviously weren't biggest hitmakers 80s , but their tunes pretty infectous aged pretty darn well . this complilations all singles more . admittingly , few tracks skippable , but considering how rare their studio albums find , i'm willing bump my review this album up five stars ! plus , re-mastering job knock your socks off . blancmange never sounded better	1

this six-man ensemble precursor hit-making group debarge . switch , who best remembered featuring late bobby debarge , overshadowed groups like commodores , but during their tenure motown ( they recorded gordy label ) , they made some enduring material . their debut single quot;they'll never bequot ; obviously their career milestone , but many other songs , including quot ; i wanna closer , quot ; quot ; i call your name , quot ; quot ; love over over againquot ; ( co-written bunny debarge ) held up well over years . though group become somewhat buried motown history books , they one label most talented acts . since none their original albums print , this best way go ( though it would not hurt beat down some used record bins quot ; switchquot ; quot ; switch ii , quot ; both which went platinum , representative their work )	1

no matter how many times i listen it jan hammer group ' melodies'other fact none musicians this album well known except jan hammer never ceases anything but purely impressive . musicianship first rate , jan hammer uses his ' guitar synthesizer ' great effect his own production this album emmaculate-from song song jan keyboards synthesizer steve kindler violin often merge into one single entity . these songs lyrics truely stylistically diverse they come . one thing every tune here , even instrumentals very melodic title suggests-the breezy romantic rb " too much loose " , " peaceful sundown " , fernando saunder warbling " i sing " lovely " don't you know " all evoke relaxed , romantic mood very pituresqe . saunder bass hip-shaking funk tines " honey 5379 " , deep " you they " " just fun " deep economical it gets-the latter wry commentary groups own music they talk " pleasing everyone " their music " fitting into mold " . like best stevie wonder ( later prince ) jan hammer group actually prove here they more then capable playing music any occasion . it not " black " or " white " sound or " rock " , " funk " , " rb " , " classical ' , " pop " or " jazz " -actually it unique distinctive combination all five styles music . centerpiece album me beautiful , transcendant " window love " -it kind ballad you'd usually hear stevie wonder or elton john but eerie chord progressions reverrbed drums sound all their own . lyrics , although i my personal impressions lyrics it definately sung it truely inspiration someone or any people who opressed-takes earth wind fire lyricism almost religious ferver . most classical element comes steve kindler manic " hyperspace " , perhaps inspired jerry goodman wailing violin theatrics jan old group mahavisnu orchestra . i cannot understand why so many people i read reviews this band think kindler bad musician-i never heard someone express tension egoless playing so much yet so theatrical same time . hammer himself his range keyboardist increbible . course his use synthesizer like spacy hard rock guitar his best known attribute but he play simpler , funkier style moog fender rhodes well . finale " your love " he displays his talents brilliant acoustic pianist-it simple , economical very beautiful ( people who don't like pop music ) say this best song album , even moog flourishes . only things i believe kept this album successful pop chart hit lack familiarity most musicians one other simple fact : if nemperor stopped marketing jan hammer group jazz act then this album would likely joined ranks ' dark side moon ' ' rumours ' one great pop releases 70 . but marketing marketing i thank wounded bird putting this out cd . but if you like 70 pop even if your knowledge classic albums doesn't extend beyong what rolling stone magazine critics or vh1 tells you classic albums this more then worth your time picking up	1

this one serious headtrip connoisseur . all sounds blend out each other . it feels almost darkly sensual how sounds wrap around each other it slightly evocative haunted house ghosts mirror ( admittedly my twisted imagination ) . it manages sound totally psychedelic ( me ) , haunted truly emotional occasions . some you may remember my review lifeforms less than impressed it . this , however , something impressed . this truly awe-inspiring . it truly my favourite fsol album them all ( bar isness/otherness because i haven't got it yet ) . this album works many different levels . if you feeling introspective , this album you . if you want take psychedelic drugs , it may not album you but then it again it could ( depends how it affects you ) . if you want lost sound album , this album you . fact , just buy bloody thing . it'll worth your while , trust me	1

after brit pop movement got exhausted , bands began break off move into very different directions . after great escape , blur treaded into really fuzzed-out tripped out territory . place where white sripes would eventually come . results mind-blowing . where weird sound effects gurgling prior albums subtle hinted , this album it they hit you like brick . those you who heard song 2 thought this album would non-stop indie rock force-to-be-reckoned-with , i don't know what tell you , if anything , song 2 just small part this mind-trip experience . so warned . cd starts out radio-friendly terms beatlesque beetlebum , it serves perfect intro where blur this cd . verses pure minimalist indie-rock style , they break into soothing radio-friendly chorus , outro builds up into torrent buzzing blurry sound-effects eventually eclipse song they're grounded . it encapsulates what come over next hour . song 2 indie-rock extreme album rocking like beast . then you head into country sad ballad man which polar opposite , psychedelic slow-burner uncountable layers acoustic , electric guitars , bass , drums , indefinable bubbling noises . like white blood cells white stripes , this cd no flow it all , listening this first time around , you no idea what hell going happen next . indie/psychedelic texture this disc , blur explore pop music , rock , ballads , pure psychedelia , unknown ( essex dogs ) . it one hell listen leave you mystified coming back more . if you're looking rock music it simultaneously most mystifying haunting , this must .	1

pat metheny john scofield both amazing talents . each one albums shine examples great instrumental guitar work . unfortunately , this album less than sum its parts . collaboration these giants yields two really interesting upbeat songs : " red one " " everybody party .

this probably not best most complete recording available fo show . however , it feature rosiland russel rest obc , which major plus . score many hightlights , strongest quot ; ohioquot ; ( which i think should ohio state song , but that whole different issue ) . bernstein music definatly not bland or forgettable , comden-green lyrics witty all all enjoyable , best demonstrated quot ; one-hundred easy waysquot ; which rosiland russell character describes how lose man . there some duds this show , biggest example quot ; swingquot ; which , aside cheezy lyrics overal bland melody , not make one want swing dance . if this number stronger -- it certainly potential -- if recording liner notes more complete , this would easi ly 5-star recording . unfortunatly , isn't going happen , so you'll setlle order enjoy this great score original cast	1

offspring so far yet put out album really disappoints me . i haven't heard ignition so i can't really say much but i heard everything they've released since smash most least good . this release however better than good , its very good . no it may not amazing smash but it lot great tracks . my favorites " staring sun " , " kids aren't alright " , " she got issues " , " pay man " . here ratings rest album ... 2 . you ever - 9/103 . staring sun - 10/10 4 . pretty fly ( white guy ) - 10/105 . kids aren't alright - 10/106 . feelings - 9.5 /107 . she got issues - 10/10 8 . walla walla - 8/109 . end line - 9/10 10 . no brakes - 7.5 /1011 . why don't you get job ? - 9.5 /10 12 . americana - 8.5 /1013 . pay man - 10/10 overall : 92% a-overall , it isn't best band but it still accomplished release . i'm big fan this band but what i've seen it may not please some fans who enjoy their earlier stuff like smash . i think smash their best but i enjoy their newer stuff well even though its just slightly different sound . i guess slight change enough tick people off . anyway , get this if your fan some tracks or just band itself .	1
phenomenon known ufo begins here . though ufo released albums before this , it wasnt until joining michael schenker , departure mick bolton release phenonmenon ufo found their legendary hard rock sound style . when michael schenker joined band he only guest few gigs , because he member scorpions time , well ended , he left scorpions joined ufo full time . large hole scorpions they called uli jon roth replace . when phenomenon released it bands strongest album so far . album opens up hard rocker ' oh , my ' killer vocals out this world guitar riff solo showed ufo finaly chosen right guitar player job . next rocker/balladier ' crystal light ' filled beautiful lyrics arpegiated guitar must heard hear how well it flows . truly one bands best slower songs . ufo biggest hit ' doctor , doctor ' next blisterng solo fiery leads schenker catchy chorus boot it no wonder this bands biggest hit single .

this most tremendous collection boby rydell music put out ! nothing ever ever perfect even though " fish " not included , so it . way , " butterfly bay " hit his i believe within summer 1963 . now , what sad it nothing this cd . i believe ' 61 into'63 his talents developing enormous clip . during summer ' 63 he starring role ann margaret , dick van dyke , paul lynde huge movie " bye bye birdie " within movie he sang very moving song , " one boy " ann margaret . this one most beautiful duets i've ever seen heard . movie huge success . he followed movie up touching very big hit record , " forget him " . , sadly , became his swan song . many americans truly , very ashamedly , " forget him " . i feel though movie " bye bye birdie " two touching songs , " one boy " ( ann margaret within movie ) big hit , " forget him " , which followed movie , he his way super stardom both recording fields motion pictures . until beatles squashed him their fluff . he ( ) more talent within his little finger than all four beatles ever . fact , his talents outweighed all fluff british artists suddenly began flood our american airwaves including not only beatles , but dave clark five , rolling stones , gerry pace makers , hermans hermets , even many american artists such beach boys , etc . i'm even including groups like " hollies " , etc . producers fluff crushed bobby rydell . it so very unfair when he totally cut out when his total talent becoming more more evident more than likely super stardom horizon . he crushed fluff . it tremendous cd available it sad what beatles other " artists " plus what american public him . shameless .	1

this cassette so popular when it came out- i remember little seven eight year old kids jamming it cabrini green projects chicago- they knew every word heart . they never heard " clean " version . way , isn't label " explicit lyrics " " clean version " contradiction terms ?? how album both same time ??? also , how come no one talks easy-e dying aids ? i guess still taboo subject . anyway , this album precious historical document- it trailblazing expression frustrations amerikkka black urban underclass time ( mid-1980 ) . unfortunately , it also very sexist album tends treat all women ho . i guess you can't everything . public enemy also came out same time they lot more sophisticated lyrically without sexist crap . -dj esperantochicago , il	1

this cd , tom proves once again he not just some las vegas has-been livin ' off oldies . maybe i bizarre tastes music , but i'm big fan both tom jones wyclef jean . combination two little freaky , but hell lot fun ! only reason i don't give it 5 stars there couple cuts i don't like ( like most cds i buy ) . most part , . . ' experimentation collaborations past few years great - ( check out quot ; lead how swing itquot ; quot ; reloadquot ;) . now i'm just waitin ' him hook up george clinton ( thoroughly hip old sob ) ..	1
i think title pretty much says it all . only problem don't they much concert footage . its just them goofing around . i wanted see action , but it pretty good nonetheless . you get see liarsenic , bayonetwork , absentimental videos which pretty good	1
heated cutting contest one trademarks jazz lore , where best friends get up stage together instantly become fiercest rivals . this particular album transplants dynamic into studio , but also adds unique dimension : eldridge father gillespie , musically speaking , time this album recorded dizzy already surpassed his mentor greatest trumpet player . if harold bloom quot ; anxiety influencequot ; literature could adapted music , i think quot ; roy dizquot ; would nice illustration it . one defining characteristics eldridge style taking great , big chances ... pushing himself instrument far they'll go then going even higher . he likened tightrope walker working without net who not afraid falling . dizzy took it next level simply walking faster , falling less often . two them together this record create pure sustained musical swashbuckling , each man pushing other his limits beyond . quot ; pretty-eyed babyquot ; them singing duet , then going into scat-singing cutting session . if these two aren't enough hold your interest , oscar peterson trio provides rhythm support . highly recommended	1
allison moorer third album , we find red-headed singer moving into new sound . lot people didn't like new sound , but i think it great . it still country , just leans more towards alt-country slightly contemporary , whereas her debut strictly traditional country . any allison moorer album you expect some meaningful lyrics , somewhat sad , miss fortune offers those more . album opens dark quot ; tumbling downquot ; , which great video . quot ; cold californiaquot ; interesting breakup song , it first single album . quot ; let goquot ; nice acoustic kind track , very reflective revealing . lyrics album very true blunt . there some good uptempos like quot ; ruby jewel herequot ; , quot ; hey jezebelquot ; , quot ; yessirreequot ; , more . i like midtempo numbers like quot;can't get there herequot ; , quot ; steal sunquot ; , quot ; up this highquot ; , closing quot ;d ying breedquot ; , highlight . overall , biggest misfortune would if you didn't give this album chance	1
i first heard angel 70 when local rock station played full albums their entirety they playing new releases , one them angel . this band just blew me away i went out bought album next day(sad say their later albums never sounded this good ) . i consider this first true progessive metal record ever made , probably one best since . i give every track 10 consider this must buy . \m	1
this music amazing . i first heard divine comedy performed summer music clinic i attended this past summer . i must admit music more powerful live than cd , however even without whole " atmosphere " goes live performance , it still amazing . it gives me chills every time i listen it , because it such powerful piece . other pieces this disc also very good . there couple beginning band , yet even those powerful , despite their simplicity . i strongly recommend this cd anyone who fan robert . smith , classical music general	1
this cd great listening , all way up down . super bon-bon radio hit , but every track bound stick your head after listen or two . lyrics nuts , i don't know what he getting exactly but music just outrageously good . i'm not usually huge fan this genre , whatever genre , but this top-ten disc me	1
curtis mayfield , edwin starr james brown among others , marvin gaye also produced compilated this release , which mostly jazz instrumental album it truly brilliant sense funky . marvin truly shines every album he since he found artistic control following his brilliant quot;what going onquot ; album . it just simply one brilliant collection ! props man even though grammys took more than 20 years until his quot ; comebackquot ; get him his rightful due props ! grade-a masterpiece	1
i traded this lp when it first came out i hungry new classy rock approaches/this filled ticket i listened it over over again/it contains variety great flow/i recommend these pieces anyone who enjoys solid psyc approach very accessable creative/i put this work up there first deep purple moby grape because it timeless , fresh exceptional listen even years later/i won't take this one out house ; too precious/you might give ' bangor flying circus ' listen , it also classic my humble opinion/with bonus getting second album one cd , this great deal	1
this wonderful album . so much melody , so many twists turns , so much fun . if you're not already love this album , then i recommend starters track 7 , hand heart , track 18 , warm regards . play these three times row ( high volume , it should obvious ) , then you'll dying hear rest album . there hardly anything detractive say fire garden . hm , let try hard : well , blowfish bit too distorted my taste . initially i found little alligator all eve too grungy , but now i'm also fond them . whookam weenie story funny ten runs ; now i skip them , but that ok . steve vai not natural born singer like robert plant bono , but he worked lot it ( like everything else he , let not forget ) , he become really good . ( i just don't understand his detractors this point . ) i couldn't imagine anybody else singing brother ( not all his spellbinding dying your love album real illusions : reflections ) . what he his guitar just beyond words . crying machine killer ( several other reviewers noted ) . he also other excellent musicians playing particularly drums ( i guess john kalodner his job well again , whatever it ) . listen while , then stand awe !	1
george lopez comedy never gets stale or outdated . long latino continues all wonders they , laughs continue roll . not only laughs appeal chicano , but it humor everyone relate , because life hilarious , thank you george helping us remember ..	1
sound , sound , sound . this band brings ear candy plenty . distorted singing them bones riffs rooster this album definitely treat ears	1
before " beneath remains " got sepultura attention they deserved , there " schizophrenia " . pure , straight ahead thrash album suggestions things come future , " schizophrenia " isn't essential metal masterpiece " beneath remains " , " arise " , or " chaos a.d. " would , but there plenty admire here . " wall " features one most excellent guitar solos ever heard andreas kisser , even though igor cavalera drumming isn't kind insane assault would his trademark later albums , it still unbelieveably heavy reminiscent dave lombardo slayer metal blade days . " escape void " " inquisition symphony " great well , only downside " schizophrenia " it wear bit thin towards end album , production ( even if this remastered ) still sounds shoddy . despite all , " schizophrenia " sepultura what " kill ' em all " " show no mercy " metallica slayer : not best come either band , but good sample what come .	1
i bought this album when it first came out enjoy every song album . my very favorite this album " broken engagement " . two variations this song sung suzanne ( her early years grown-up ) awesome . when i travel i always take this album me enjoy . i am also buying album this amazon so i always able enjoy songs . i wish alison krauss would produce album like this cox family . it would fantastic	1
this cd so good !! i really wish braid wouldn't broken up ! it would so cool see braid get up kids together ... trompe le monde great song . everyone go out buy all braid cds !	1

though i didn't become big fan george strait until i saw him movie pure country , i think george put out some excellent records . his ' 99 album always never same no exception . record initial hit single , " meanwhile " , classic george strait country song . waltzing tempo song reminiscent one george early hit songs , " you look so good love " , although " meanwhile " bit slower . what would album george if it didn't least one lost-love song it ? besides " meanwhile " , this record includes two other songs lost-love theme , " that truth " " 4 minus 3 equals zero " , latter song added dimension marital breakup . strait album not all cry-in-your-beer , though . this album , " write this down " , " one you " , title song " always never same " fun , up-tempo songs i think danced lot dance floors . furthermore , george three positive love songs this record : " i look you " , " that where i wanna take our love " , " what you say " . this listenable , well-pu t-t ogether album , like practically everything george . george still excellent record always never same	1
there three circle collections . general opinion first album best , third album close second this weakest three . i love all three but this one particularly appeals me . it many traditional musicians singers but also few less obvious singers like john denver , levon helm ( band ) , john prine , roger mcguinn ( byrds ) , paulette carlson ( highway 101 ) bruce hornsby . perhaps it presence such guests some dislike but you can't please everybody . whatever you may think normal music some guests recorded , they all justify their place this excellent album traditional music , sometimes singing songs they've previously recorded , but adapted traditional setting . some them , it may their chance record some traditional country without upsetting their fans or their record label . both would understand this ( them ) one-off . they certainly made most their opportunity . so we get bruce hornsby singing playing piano valley road , but traditional country/bluegrass style . roger mcguinn chris hillman , both ex-members byrds , sing play guitar you ain't going nowhere , bob dylan song recorded byrds sixties . michael martin murphey sings plays guitar lost river , one his own songs . john hiatt sings duet roseanne cash one step over line . john prine sings plays guitar his song grandpa carpenter . some songs oldies like life railway heaven ( featuring johnny cash ) , i'm sitting top world ( featuring jimmy martin ) , title track ( featuring everybody but particularly johnny cash , roy acuff ricky skaggs ) amazing grace , instrumental solo randy scruggs . other songs appear originals including so it goes ( featuring john denver ) , mary danced soldiers ( featuring emmylou ) lovin ' side ( featuring paulette carlson ) . if you haven't got any circle albums , this album great one start , especially if you're relatively new traditional country music	1
so , i just bought this version , after owning revival cast , it recently . there definitly good things this recording . music beautiful old joe beautiful voice . also , joe hardy better this recording than revival . unfortunately lola not greatest this cast , i much perfered revival lola . so which version should you get ? collectors , should get both , people who perfer more classical musical theater should get this version . other than , new version , better , better value . favorite song : " goodbye , old girl	1

rough tumble , powerhouse rock ' roll band , aerosmith america answer british rock . ' toys attic ' , released march 1975 , may not their greatest album ( would follow-up ' rocks ' ) , but it pretty darn close . building their success old fashioned way late john houseman would say ( they earned it ! ) , aerosmith ultimate road warriors , playing america high school gyms social halls while worrying if they get axe their own record company they came symbolize hard rock excellence 1970 . anthems well known probably overplayed some classic rock radio . " sweet emotion " always my top three ... into , outro , sleeze , sass ... man its all there , including voice box guitar ! " toys " , song , opens album primal urgency , kind like boston own " immigrant song " . " no more no more " good it gets ; lyrics ( road got bitch ! ) , arrangement , production - all flawless ! " round round " sabbathesque , heavy aerosmith would ever get ! " walk this way " bugs me now but it still one most inflential songs last 30 years ( rock rap anybody ) . " adam apple " more my style , back when cain abel ! ( check ou live version ' pandora box ' joe " f'n perry saying " this hard work " before he launches into riff ! ) . whatever drugs band doing , oh my they aplenty , they seemed help them create this timeless material . although mister tyler may not remember " you see me cryin " ( story hilarious book " walk this way " ) , aerosmith enthusiasts never forget merry-go round 1975 , year america threw her hat into ring hard rock greatness	1
even though brian wilson voice changed bit since heydey beach boys sixties , he still delivers some nice versions old songs , easy going manner audience . i love song " love mercy " , i'm glad he included it this concert	1
i love this show ! said , i not care this version it . inclusion word " concept " title means it just . this , thankfully , not final version show would later spawn hit song , " one night bangkok " . most broadway musicals , musical numbers tell basic story show . if you listen recordings phantom , mama mia , beauty beast , you discern basic storyline show . listening this particular recording chess , though , leave you wondering " what ? " broadway arrival chess saw much needed reworking storyline arrangement musical numbers . this recording seems too much like mish-mash songs don't really relate each other . musical fanatics ( like myself ) , i say " yes , you should this recording your collection " , if only understand how much work went into show before it opened broadway . if you only buying album because " one night bangkok " , purchase broadway recording instead ; you'll much happier performance phillip casnoff rather than murray head	-1
where i thought " side " showed angry poet , this record shows us same man , grown older full pain . some songs just want make you cry , they so good , so personal . it really hard praise " blood tracks " enough . it one best records ever made . imagery " tangled up blue , " stay you long after record ends . " if you see her , say hello " move you " you're big girl now . " " idiot winds " haunt you " lily , rosemary jack hearts , " excite you . i love this record	1
this band caught my attention little steven underground garage . although i usually shy away catchy pop songs , i say contrast writes them better than today emo bands or mainstream shoe-gazing brit pop bands ten years ago . i can't really compare them anyone current , but guitar work reminds me early dumptruck if they prozac ( ok ... i'm 35 years old out touch current music ) . high points album disconnected , something tells me , your starring role . i need check out some their early work	1
honestly , i'd never actually heard magic sam when i bought this album , but lot reading blues brought me purchase magic sam quot ; black magic . quot ; i now own everything sam-related i get my hands . this album my favorite , while others may recommend quot ; west side soulquot ; over this , quot ; black magicquot ; seems his most steady arranged material available . magic sam blends chicago blues sound soul inspired voice both riviting relaxing . everyone i listen this album ends up loving it . quot ; black magicquot ; constantly my listening rotation , i would recommend this album highly anyone who any taste soul , ramp ; , or blues	1

jelly jam features ty tabor guitar ( king ) , john myung bass ( dream theater ) , rod morgenstein drums ( dixie dregs ) . i would say jelly jam more ty tabor side project than others here , since he wrote all lyrics most music this album . you might very well imagine , there healthy dose king sounding material this disc . matter fact " st " could king album ( without pennick vocal ) , especially relative king " gretchen " era . jelly jam " st " just magnificent effort . it far best thing i've ever heard king side project , there many . this album filled killer hooky riffs , rumbling towering leads , killer right pocket rhythm section ! but most awe inspiring part " st " amazing song writing going here , especially musical end . monster riffs go hand hand beautiful intense melodies married ty , lennon like vocals , lush tapestry sonic delights fill ones ears . this album rivals " gretchen " me . there no mistake ty must central figure conceiving king material their early years . " st " just rocks no end , filled songs would fit perfectly " gretchen ! " matter fact , " st " whole rocks harder than " gretchen , " without losing it exotic flavor mixing hendrix , pink floyd , beatles , rush , pat travers into smoldering concoction epic proportion so evident " gretchen ! " jelly jam " st " far my favorite post 2000 album , essential anyone interested king or king influences . your ears addicted ! i know mine !	1
i borrowed title former dead kennedy vocalist , jello biafra , who many aspects long mirrored embodied same wry witted , conversationally suicidal social critiques late bill hicks - before hicks , actually . both completely unremitting their damning-yet-accurate views empire-thirsty , right wing dystopia wrought dissemblance , blind nationalism , headcase christian fundamentalism , mindless consumption xenophobia . bill often delivered his message zeal preacher . fact , he often compared thought one . yet he railed frantically against hypocrisy lunacy right wing , christian fundamentalist movement , case you're not awake , these very same corporate hitmen statist mass murderers who charge throughout 1980s , who now unconstitutionally charge again hoping bring their uniquely vile interpretation theocratic state . i'm talking " pro nuclear armament " christians , against-abortion-yet-all-in-favor-of-the-death-penalty-and-invading-foreign-countries-and-slaughtering-and-raping-scores-of-men-women-and-children " pro life " projective crowd . you know , wholesome , morally upright ' christians ' who blame poor people gulf not leaving . bill divergent attacks aren't against faith or christianity , but very narrow margin it far-right projective movement he wisely perceived ominous threat particular form fascism which politically amassed within corporate structures , , time shown , used subvert ongoing evolution our species attempting further cloud public perceptions . bill rants alive these observations , much like jello biafra , seem prophetic looking back , given what transpired , how many us weren't wide awake we should've all these years . it also noteworthy how hick undeniably influenced ever brazen syndicated talk radio crier new world order fascism , alex jones , who likewise , if not ironically , also texan . i immediately thought hicks when i saw jones crash press conference then governor george bush , lit into babbling thug series questions media suckers enablers wouldn't dare touch , only hauled off out handcuffs . it sort fearless evocation hicks , not caring what others thought him . their problem , not his . many find it odd bill believer , strong faith , spoke passionately god , potential world peace unity within our grasp should we ever decide collectively make it so . he so because he blessed what many right wingers apparently not : big heart , conscience , inquisitive , sharp intellect . other hand , bill often likened his work " chomsky dick jokes . " ' rant ' good place start although there more acutely felt view bill life found tracing his early work end his short lived life which became colored somewhat newfound ease , spiritual sobriety , his struggles media censorship , coming terms illness unfortunately took him life beyond before more people would hear his message . briefly address oft debated denis leary vs bill hicks issue , it rather simple actually : yes , leary stole bits hicks ' routines . however , leary put spin it ; instead coming liberal/progressive/chomskyan critique angle , appealing subversive sensibilities , he dumbed it down depoliticized , sports lovin ' , beer chuggin ' middle ground crowd , which assured more angry , white guys their female counterparts would respond favorably , much same republican talk radio fox " news " mentality enshrouds our societal din erodes public discourse . afterall , when dealing people whose every assumption regarding our current state affairs incorrect , it impossible even begin debate . it irrational . it mindset lures basis appealing mass ignorance free floating anxieties , both personal social , largely find no other * convenient * acknowledgement . other words , leary encouraged accepted mode his crowds existence , where hicks , much like lenny bruce , questioned confronted it ways really made some people think , therefore become uncomfortable surly . those didn't like hicks really didn't like him , ya know ? alone speaks volumes . it why leary more popular , so speak , than hicks ; he used more profanity than bill , but far less ideologically politically profane iconoclastic . if there message found rant minor , within bill voice , it we all passion energy what true just within our hearts ... soul , voice question express ourselves , we should express ... it immoral , perhaps sin , instead submit , not so while we live world where we still ability so	1
so sings elderane elf last track , tower , maybe he right , regard life general regard this opera . it would not possible understand story lyrics themselves , but insert contains 5 1/2 pages (!) fine print which explain plot . maybe helps appreciation little ( it certainly indicates effort expended tobias project ) but music fine its own . here real opera 10 parts sung 10 different performers , every one 13 tracks represents very listenable power metal . it cliff hanger though ; you not know what happens young maiden held prison witchcraft until you listen part 2 . i considered giving it five stars but decided it fits my listening often category more than listening over over . ( please see my profile brief discussion my rating philosophy . ) 1/8/07 revision . may last year i gave this four stars . i've listening it lot lately decided it fits my criteria five	1

milan records owns rights lot later piazzolla canon , since his death steadily mining its holdings number cd reissues compilations readily identified milan similarity cover art used . don't fooled four seasons buenos aires , however . while it fine recording , piazzolla not appear it anything but composer . i didn't read back cd cover before i bought it so when i opened it , i surprised find cover fooled me into thinking piazzolla featured . i played it anyway , prepared worst , many offerings piazzolla compositions turn out mediocre best . first , it seemed like my fears confirmed , but after several listens i warmed music . those familiar ap " four seasons " sequence know they among most classically oriented his works only slightest connection tango . but they also know when performed piazzolla one his musical formations , they among most powerful his longer works . anyone taking task interpretation better know well what heck they doing or risk making musical fools themselves . this interpretation " four seasons " brazilian orchestra my view started rather weakly . it isn't until " winter " ( invierno porteno ) reached power majesty music comes fruition . there out , rest cd quite good . my favorites remainder three parts " libertango " sequence they performed which features some excellent mandolin work deus xango , which closes recording jazzy rendering oddly reminiscent some old cti-era jazz recordings . weakness start drops star , but its rest recording which puts this recommended category anyone who loves music astor piazzolla	1

i've mentioned many my other reviews , hip-hop originates houston close spot my heart . dj screw style slowed-down , chopped up music hooked me upon my first listen it , even though he gone now , rest h-town continue carry his legacy slow-tempo , syrupy music , slurry accent . i've got lot favorites residing houston , ranging chamillionaire , big moe , paul wall , lil ' keke , lil ' pokey , among others . however , my favorite entire bunch , ironically , rapper least amount ties dj screw - devin dude . i turned onto devin through dr. dre 2001 record , like many others presumably . his chorus " **** you " so explicit , yet so hilarious , his verse so smooth , i check this kid out . finding out he comes h-town turned me onto cat even more , once i listened tryin ' ta live , i hooked . devin dude smoothest emcee this side .. heck , i really don't know who smoother than devin . some would argue too $hort , but even first pimp rap hard time matching charisma resonates devin body . not only this dude coolest thing this side smirnoff ice , he also lyrics back it up ; he may not mathematical emcee some backpackers fiend , but he tight rhymes , laced humor rarely found elsewhere . southern grooves found all over this album , hilarious tales retold player you never hate . this album tha x-treme both tight hell , but i think this one may rank little bit above it successor , due songs like " i-hi " " lacville ' 79 . " still , if you're one hip-hop heads who enjoys good music no matter where it comes , devin sophomore effort , tryin ' ta live , you	1

it took me few listens , but i grown quite fond this album cannot seem get it out my cd player . i never heard anything else psyche so i cannot compare this anything else they their long career . haunting melodies sorrowfull droning vocals . there alot passion mix here . you feel everything darren singing . musically i could compare this alot different synth bands , but sound pretty unique . echoing drums reminescent lycia , drawn out synth lines deep overtones sprinkling piano either synthesized or very amplified guitar . my only complaint few songs lack variation seem drone same direction without hooks or buildup any sort . some very excellent tracks here though , my favorites until , theme 7/assassin reprise .	1

oh boy ... it really pains me write this review say things i'm say , but ... i no choice ! this , far i'm concerned , without doubt weakest ac/dc record ever . i know lot diehards going want hang me such heretic , but ... i'm sorry , i grew up listening " back black " , " those rock " , " highway hell " " razor edge " , so you imagine how dissapointed i feel when i listen slow songs like " can't stop rn'r " , " come get it " " damned " ... darn record chock full songs like !!! god , mercy ... whenever i problems sleep , i put this pill ... i can't listen it , i'm not joking !!! there , course , some great songs : title track , " safe ny city " , " satellite blues " , " give it up " stellar , some best songs band ever written . sure , songwriting way more focused than say ... " fly wall " , but songs , most part , painfully slow long , they lack punch ( except those tracks i mentioned earlier ... ) what record gains songwriting focus it loses heavyness , i think it bad tradeoff . so , 4 great , fast , rocking songs out 12 ... how bad ? well , i'll let you decide , but i know , least me , this record truly stiff beyond recovery ...	-1

" strangers night " frank sinatra first big hit single since " witchcraft " , eight years earlier . some people apparently don't care song , but it win grammy record year ( what it worth ) . back 1960s , when someone smash hit single they would usually title subsequent album after it , which case here . album also includes follow up single , " summer wind " , which also hit , albeit not big one . rest album features seemingly random mix songs , some old some new . sinatra sings songs well , but some songs don't really suit him , like " downtown " " yes sir , that my baby " . overall , pretty good album , albeit short one ( 27 minutes long )	1
i remember cinderella 80s early 90s . i still remembered their songs like nobody fool don't know what you got . i am regular local bar they best cinderella their jukebox i played those songs . they still held up i take into account their solid musicianship . i got this cd i found it wal mart less than 10 bucks so i figured might well . i even remembered when they sold out shelter me . it took me back 80s i didn't feel so nutty any more some reason i regained lot my looks i had- least right now i don't physically look different . their sound shelter me it still sounds exactly same nobody fool , etc , it just it watered down not initimidating . get this if you miss 80s metal don't care newer mtv bands .	1
1990 , george michael released his second album entitled , listen without prejudice volume 1 . this album not what faith turned out , this album , still taking up george sound pop/rb , sheds george his faith skin . this great album cover concept what going world . praying time first single album . this song beyond amazing . it definitely one best songs this album . it seems focus way we all struggle survive world today . i think he trying point out making money these days not all hunky dory . if listen closely just music , it'll sound like something john lennon would compose . freedom 90 second single album . no , this not re-recorded rendition classic hit he wham ! hit he wham ! dance type love song , while this song just george throwing away his " faith " days shedding new skin . music video went this single definitely my favorite george michael music video . george not appear video , but five sexy supermodels appear . those five models : " linda evangelista " , beautiful , innocent-looking short-haired blonde , wearing only turtleneck sweater , " naomi campbell " , foxy african-american brit , who dances around , wearing bikini headphones , " christy turlington " , doe-eyed brunette who walks straight down living room hall , wrapped around bed sheet , " cindy crawford " , sexy brunette , who relaxes , while taking bath , " tatjana patitz " , seductive german blonde , who stands up against wall , smoking cigarette . they won't go when i go this song originally recorded back 1974 stevie wonder . i never heard stevie wonder version i not care hear it because i not like stevie wonder or his pathetic music . but when i heard george rendition , i immediately flipped over it . he sings it so smooth he sings it heart . something save acoustic guitar really brings out sound this song music . not bad song . cowboys angels fifth final single album . this amazing song seems focus two different people who seemed found each other seemed found love each other . definitely beautiful song . medley : waiting day/you can't always get what you want third single album . usually , medlies performed live concert live promotional performances , but george decided record studio medley . this song more impressive than i expected . " waiting day " also george shedding his skin his " faith " album coming into era . definitely great song(s ) . mothers pride not bad . heal pain fourth single album . i cannot go without listening this song . this one absolutely amazing . acoustic guitar incredible . harmonies amazing . george voice , usual , outstanding . definitely song not miss . soul free not bad . waiting ( reprise ) this song brings this album end reprise " waiting day/you can't always get what you want " medley . this version even better , especially sounding more mellow more subtle , george voice sound very smooth soothing . song no fan should skip . before i got this album , i expecting only two or three songs worth listening , since i considered faith george best album . but after listening entire album , i shocked hear how incredible this album . faith , me , still stands his best album , but listen without prejudice volume 1 one step behind faith . this album definitely worth time money	1

this two-disc deluxe edition famous influential " beano " album . disc one contains both mono original release ( 1966 ) stereo version ( 1969 ) john mayall bluesbreakers eric clapton album . review disc one , i would refer you many existing reviews original release this important album . i add little all that said before , other than say listen carefully you heard stepping out . ramblin ' my mind features young eric vocals style he came develop his solo career . disc two ( reason i bought deluxe edition ) contains 19 extra tracks , interesting part if , like me , you already own original version bluesbreakers album cd . extra tracks 1-13 both live studio . instance , there some bbc radio live studio broadcasts 1965 early 1966 some recording studio session tracks , which predated album . sound quality quite good tracks 1-13 couple those tracks highlight ( even early stage ) eric clapton playing style he known . but best all , extra tracks 14 19 recorded live flamingo club london march april 1966 . those recordings often primitive , raw , muddy distorted , but you'll hear some clapton most fiery fluid playing blues guitar standards 14 . they call it stormy monday , 17 . you ever loved woman 19 . hoochie coochie man . stormy monday same track that john mayall looking back , tracks 17 19 ( above ) , amongst others , same tracks released john mayall primal solos . there nevertheless 9 unreleased tracks disc 2 . this album era when eric clapton played gibson les paul developed his reputation " god " . it must-have album eric clapton fans , this deluxe edition , packaging original album , 19 extra tracks 20 page booklet , gives you best comprehension how it all happened . they say , rest history ...... whilst i praised clapton musical giant he become , credit should given john mayall astute influential band-leader , mentor young eric catalyst london blues scene .	1
so , i ended up buying this album not main piece , golijov ayre but upshaw version berio folksongs . fact , length time i've this disc , which couple months , least , i never even once attempted listening golijov piece . truth matter , i kept telling myself i didn't like goljov - which silly contradictory me since i've always enjoyed golijov dreams prayers isaac blind . fact , because i knew i enjoyed isaac blind , i investigated whether or not i'd enjoy golijov newly released opera , ainadamar . after listening some 30 second samples amazon.com, i must admit i wasn't impressed what i heard . i also investigated his la pasion segun san marcos only arrive opinion it , too , lacking very many ways . i immediately figured aside isaac blind , golijov other material seemed bland , unempathetic largely undeveloped - almost if he hurry prolific ! well , needless say , my opinion him immediately changed when i finally decided listen ayre . very first note , i realized it golijov my familiarity isaac blind i instantaneously drawn . rhythm exotic , casual , yet refined , harmony transported me away 21st century america into wholly other multi-cultural dimension . introduction holds you suspense , awaiting what next , then gradually shifts into mode encompassed jewish arabesque tones colors . upshaw singing so evocative pronounced , just like her performance gorecki " symphony no . 3 , " she doesn't spare any emotion her performance . her voice alone adds so much texture these songs ! song cycle ranges beautiful absurd , times , upshaw singing leading way . while music itself often appears move place place , never seeming touch same place twice , there actually so much cohsiveness each song it impossible not realize these songs rely upon each other their strength viability just like any other architectural composition . some people harangue golijov popular living composer , often berating him fallible characterizations . some even claim he isn't original only recycling what come before order put himself among ranks mozart , mahler , shostakovich . one reviewer belows states , golijov considered brittany spears classical . far it , i see it ! golijov music no less original than many other composers , including mozart himself . fact , it truly quite difficult find any composer , living or dead , who not inspired or not find their cue music preceded them . golijov may take certain themes borrowed previous composers ( such composing song cycle based berio folksongs ) incorporate those themes into larger scheme , but such inspiration no different than countless composed renditions " variations theme paganini . " don't let overly traditionalist music-lovers stray you away this release ! it truly what your heart , soul , ears searching	1
this recording makes wonderful background music , but it not background music . it very inventive musician exploring music great composer it deserves close listening . fred hersch impeccable pianist billy strayhorn often lush compositions perfect vehicles him . string orchestra under direction eric stern provides accent accompaniment without ever becoming instrusive or overwhelming . everything fits together nicely every cut worthwhile . if i choose favorite it would beautiful " lament orchid .	1

i admit when this album first came out , i so dissapointed . i only liked through rain bringin ' heartbreak time . i disliked album so much i gave it friend lol . but then i just recently started listening it again , i love nearly every song album . okay , her vocals aren't very best , but they way underrated . songs like " lullaby " " you your chance " , her falsetto makes songs sound kinda mysterious sexy . those who think her voice " gone " , listen through rain subtle invitation , espeically end both songs . incredible ! some mariah best vocals ever . her voice evolved soul-less empty during music box days . what you guys miss youthful sound she , but this album recorded 10 years after era . what i love mariah almost singing save herself now . so much conviction her voice . i really think if you dislike this album because vocals , listen it again like i , you'll probably like it lot more . only songs i dislike this record " boy " , " sunflowers " , " ttr remix " . i also like irresistable without rappers lot better . it some promo cd . but i really dont mind rappers much anymore	1
its shame todays world all producer needs copy someone elses work take credit it . sometimes results good though , sometimes bad . but tell you truth , this really isn't best albums using blue note samples . if you want hear real rawness flavour these tracks , i would advise you get originals . you would then not dissapointed . otherwise if you just looking mixed up compilation cuts have'nt really worked properly but still sound ok because original elements there , get this . i like lootpack , madlib other productions especially madlibs(quasi , ynq)own projects too , i love hip hop , mostly hip hop sampled jazz cuts which big part my life( i.e. tcq , black sheep , chi ali , kmd , lotns , main source , artifacts , premiers stuff , ditc , etc . 90 time , list goes forever !! ) added them little extra flavour . but reality , theres lot originals always better because they their own arrangements vocals sounding excellent already , then work newer versions just take good parts away , make it sound wack or change it horribly . original artists came up music , wrote it down , then played real instruments ! (thats talent ! ) , not digital workstations , samplers , turntables grooveboxes easy access stealing tracks getting credit it . so you beat make it worthwhile what you actually doing otherwise it waste time , whether ten steps ahead , or one step ahead , but never back any steps !!. don't get me wrong , i use all these types equipment studios too aswel instruments . sampling excellent if properly like madlib shown before . if you achieve nice sound original progress it or highlight sections make them stand out different sections compositions without ruining it , thats tight !. but here theres nothing makes it any way good originals , mostly not sound too good . mainly because production reasons , i not feel enough put into it or thought advance original blue note compositions . it change perceptions deeply . i mean , one example , bobbi humphreys sampled cut ' please set me ease'has processed sounds like it auto bpm mixed beat wav studio it makes it sound electronic(not intentionally ) off-key , it gets repetitive , i liked hearing 6-7 minutes original never got bored it because its variation bobbis singing , it also sounded how it should sound like(the quality ) . theres so much say this album , but not enough space or time , i just hope hope blue note would call me up next time , i really appreciate all their work my heart . but if you just looking little flavour you don't know too much blue note , i'd say get it . if you ear genuine love instrumental compositions blue note work , any other good jazz artists , or even if you produced while know using samples too you understand me . otherwise it must your level not mine so tick me ' unhelpful ' . i give this 2 stars , 1 fact it contains blue note classics 1 madlibs appreciation effort too . he tight producer , its just this don't show his real skills . but thats all !! hope i helped . choose wisely people ! peace	-1
i think it very difficult discover entire cd ( though i admit i prefer disc 1 ) reels through emotions piano evoke . don't worry , it not all solo piano ; there orchestral accompaniments throughout , but this one simplest , sweetest renditions clair de lune i heard . i no problem correct labeling songs when i downloaded it my computer , though . i think this great beginner classical cd -- , if you're not sure which composer you'd like try something else , you get good variety . ( no focusing just baroque , thank you very much . ) happy listening	1
year 1998 time changed lots music world ... least country . quite popular female country artist shania twain decided after making two albums make album would little bit ... or much commercial .

i never thought diana could top her lady sings blues soundtrack , but girlfriend blue . i really think this her best work ever . her renditions these standards more authentically jazzy than her lstb recordings . this true orchestration well . her version but beautiful pretty damn close billie . i think most people agree diana not billie holiday . however , sheer beauty diana voice more than compensates . she super cool easy living totally bewildered you've change . her rendition solitude melancholy hauntingly beautiful . she easy laid back what difference . she also sings behind beat which enhances her take this song . this project testament diana versatility , depth ability recording artist . i truly hope she ventures more into world jazz -- i think deep down she jazz singer . i recommend this cd anyone who enjoys good jazz .	1

friends distinction one best soul groups 60 early 70 . you actually cannot put them just one category , because they delved into pop music some more soulful rb ballads expertise unsurpassed era . " grazin grass " monster hit you could not help but sing every time you heard song( " bir-hir-hir-hirrrrrds dartin ' ... out trees !!! " ) ... period . it fun song listen sing . my favorite this group all time very blusey " i really hope you " " you got me going circles " which my estimation riveled some other soul groups like delfonics temptations it silky smooth delivery . mannnn !!! i could listen million times . i also liked " love or let me lonely " which great pop smash hit it own right(the horn string arrangements simply fabulous ) . they absolutely ... " bomb .	1

i adore this latest release vertical horizon . three cd i this group , this my favorite , which says lot because i played their last cd , everything you want , constantly . go more refined sound than everything you want while still keeping edgy , but not quite metal sound . group seems worked out their place music world going james taylor like sound running thin ice trying metal band sound everything you want . it perfect blend . after only listening it twice i couldn't get song i'm still here out my head . vocal blending members ' voices nicely collaborated just enough vocal originality lead singer not confused all those other bands . song styles fairly similar so cd blends well without monotomy every song sounding exactly same . whether you new this band or long time fan you hooked this cd	1
great music , vocals almost sound semi skater i prefer masculine vocals but they made cd good sound equalization . this title better than their " putp " but im glad i both	1
nearly four decades musical magic jimmy smith , kenny burrell grady tate kicked-off 1965 this master trio album . album name - organ grinder swing - became synonimous jimmy smiths concert highlight throughout his long career . " organ grinder swing " opens this album gets treat you expect this classic tune fast straight 4/4 fascinating interplay smith burrell(not too many organist recorded this tune , guess why ? ) . " oh , no , babe " drenched-down blues where both smith burrell gives power demonstration their deep musical roots . lovely ballad " i'll close my eyes " 3 minute pure mellowness demonstrates smiths passion ballads . later over-recorded " satin doll " , written duke ellington rounds up this great album nice organ registration changes became jimmy trademark ( smith always claimed he inspired erroll garner playing block chords adding fats waller sound ) . organ jazz produced many excellent drummers , but some stands out - grady tate one few . everything said kenny burrell his guitar wizardry . organ grinder swing must every serious jazz collection	1
i fan cold blood since their great debut lp 1969 . luckily i saw them once eastowne ballroom detroit 1971 . they opening act 3 band show . after bands intro instrumental " shop talk " , vocalist lydia pense became focus stage . she vocally loose , very stage active ! behind her rhythm section cooked . keyboardist raul matute purred his hammond , bass man rod ellicott oddly played funky hofner ( beatle ) bass . their horn section very tight , adding punch every song , very well arranged . i walked out night loving every minute their set , much bigger fan than before . i bought all their subsequent lp , hoped see them play again soon . this small label 1973 sound board recording dig music brings me back evening . although this cd offers only 5 songs ( 40+ minutes ) minimal audience ( no mention recording date or location ) , cold blood plays all songs pure funk fire ! songs added vitality " live " , vocals key , horns crisp , nothing sounds tired ! no , this not one those " we played these songs waaaay too many years , sorry , we only here money " sets . lydia voice sounds great , she loose , hits some astonishingly high notes . this " one kind " release , cold blood enjoying music truly their own . blend lydia soulful voice , pure stax arrangements . oddly nothing here sounds outdated almost 30 years later ! how they ever came out bay area i never completely understand ? only negatives this cd release short set , mono recording ( hopefully they expand length this cd release ) . it however truly document their early 70 " live " shows . so anyone who enjoyed cold blood , you love this dream cd ! unfortunately i never saw them again live , but this cd they confirm exactly what i heard night 3 decades ago . tightest 70 soul band west mississippi	1
this my 1st yanni cd . i loved it so much bought several others , but others pale comparison this one . this cd more neoclassical feel , instruments less " synthesized " than other cds . example , it sounds if he playing real piano rather than playing synthesizer computer generated sound . i wake up this every morning , i frequently play it softly work . but best thing walk ocean beach this playing your headphones ... what moving experience ! try it if you	1
most these tunes acquire nice , attention-getting emotional edge their acoustic settings . " she blinded me science " hilarious no matter what you it . enjoy	1
there something strange primative beats laid down kimbrough his band . view into what blues may sounded like 50 years ago , but amp'ed up . it tough pull yourself away this sound . liner notes robert palmer also great . if you looking soemthing different , but great , check out this album	1

joan osborne pretty little stranger gem . her voice style reminiscent very early linda ronstadt , when she country . those old enough remember ronstadt early years recognize compliment . better yet , songs lovely interesting , something one rarely finds , intelligent lyrics . you're not likely hear this music mainstream radio stations , but i liked it lot	1
these guys really good ! rodrigo pick gabriela fingers ( hands guitar percussion ; there such thing ? i guess yes ! ) . great stuff ! they rock	1
this album fantastic ! songs pop it finest - gentle , charming , catchy , fun sing . boy least likely plays simple music that easy ears . after hearing banjo " gentle me " stellar chorus " paper cuts " first time , i hooked . i hear subtle beach boys influences , although this isn't exactly groundbreaking record , it just so good you'll hardly notice . instrumentation simple yet flawless . xylophones , banjos , handclaps ... lo-fi sound really works this group , album enjoyable first song last . highlights really include every track . each one good its own , collection they form awesome album . child-like charm found " monsters , " " i'm glad i hitched my apple wagon your star , " " i see spiders when i close my eyes " irresistable . all indie pop i've heard , this ranks up there shins belle sebastian . i recommend this anyone who likes feel-good pop songs . it just might best record 2005 . note : i no clue why amazon charging $30.99 this , but don't get it here . either wait until it released u.s. or buy it www.insound.com , where it only $14.99	1
this hands down best slayer album next reign blood but thats just my opinion . if your fan extreme thrash metal then you should get this , songs range everything war , death , murder destruction horrors hell so lyrics allways deal dark subject matter but doesn't mean this album bad infact its high quality album its just not alot people gonna like this so its just matter taste . drummer dave lambardo pretty good job within fast aggressive music both guitarists kerry king jeff hanneman make some wild blistering solos especially songs like war ensemble skeletons society which best songs ever !. tom ayara good vocalist this sort thrash music very good bass player , all this makes whole uncomprimising album not mention fantastic underrated songs like dead skin mask which inspired notorious serial killer ed gein song hollowed point get this album now !.	1
i don't like compare arrangements songs era era . if song works certain arrangement , i consider itself great achievemen t.t hese songs all arranged singer each innovative , sensual , relaxing extraordinarily well performed . this isn't usual brand " jazz " singers recent years wonderful voices but tired arrangements gershwin other great songs . this cd brings new life these songs just when you thought last monheit , krall bentyne etc cd buried song generation . this cd one coolest its genre quite while . just wait til you hear fretless bass solo " help " . very cool indeed ..	1

johnny rotten must upset his record company when he recorded this effort . production sloppy there doesn't appear any attempts song construction . it simply jah wobble wobbling while rotten moans rants unintelligibly . it wouldn't surprise me if all tracks recorded one take one day . blah blah blah pil first album much better	-1
i started collecting this series ultra trance 4 , blown away , especially awesome second disc . but volume 5 , i found myself skipping some mediocre songs , there simply nothing i heard " wow factor " tracks like white room . 6 still not good 4 , but i honestly feel this solid release casual listeners ( like myself ) . unlike last time , i'm not skipping anything , there couple tracks i actually love . tracking treasure down , can't sleep find way made album worth purchase , my eyes . if you're like me you don't already import best trance around world , this probably worthy purchase . if you're more worldly up-to-date this stuff , you should probably pass ... you probably didn't need me tell you	1
ammonia avenue many parsons fans ' favorite album . it also many least favorite . it furthering his change towards pop music , prog rock he began . album opens prime time , one better tracks . it fame , star , much same limelight ( later album stereotomy ) , but not quite good . still , it quite enjoyable . let me go home reminds me i don't wanna go home turn friendly card . both aren't very good . lyrically , this song doesn't fit album , lyrics themselves don't seem go together . easily worst song album . one good reason step up . it bit repetitive , but it catchy , worth listening context album . while it not great out context , all parsons albums meant listened start finish . though this album theme not apparent , it still flows should treated concept album . since last goodbye ballad i personally enjoy . it not overdone , but not underdone either . it , goldilocks would say , just right . don't answer me lot like one good reason , it very catchy . song , it pretty good , but it could more refined , especially lyrically . dancing high wire one my favorites album . it could better , but colin blunstone ( i think they're his ) vocals shine this song . you don't believe catchy song , probably right middle , behind don't answer me ahead one good reason . pipeline only instrumental this disc , which disappointing , but it quite well . it not parsons ' best , but it well better than his wors t.t hen , last but not least , comes title track . this song gem album . it one my favorite parsons ' songs , probably makes any my top 50 song lists . only downside overdone instrumental interlude middle , but even sounds good ( opposed one silence i , eye sky ) . this album good starting place parsons if you're pop fan . if you like songs more vein pink floyd , start i , robot . then progress until you get this album . like any parsons album , it takes several listens , but fewer than most his albums	1
hey , this ain't beatles . fourmost established their reputation tight , exciting act liverpool alongside beatles , incorporating cabaret-styled humor their act before they forced go cabaret . they relied totally outside material , certainly didn't know how cope when merseybeat ended end ' 65 . what they good example prime merseybeat , even goofy tune like girls , girls , girls . beatles much same thing searchin ' early their career ( though , unlike fourmost , they didn't actually release it record , though they commit it tape their jan , ' 62 decca audition ) . if you buy prudently , this disc under $10.00 , including shipping . there enough good songs , imo , justify price , , 33 songs , you certainly can't say record company stingy . if you like merseybeat aren't expecting beatles , you'll pleased this disc	1
i'm music teacher i speak italian very well . i heard most this cd while cleaning up after tuscan-themed teacher appreciation lunch my own son school . i think this cd great find : contains whole bunch music i wasn't familiar ; witty lyrics , real authentic , not-overproduced feel . i really not heard indigenous italian jazz , now i find it great stuff . i'm pretty picky -- instance , love putamayo gypsy caravan arabic groove but detest jewish odyssey . so what it worth , that my opinion	1
i guess its just common trait supergroups characterize band such - its incidental part their status come up album filled splendid tracks but goes unnoticed masses , like queen hot space , yes ' tormato , led zep lp followed houses holy - thus case this here fourth album release one most remarkable bands this side progressive " art-rock " music genre ( one me all time favourites nonetheless ) - group , supertramp . other purist fans would claim point spite say their breakfast america album comes sell-out ( perhaps those who'd say so only hated idea album sold out so well selling millions copies ) band moved stripping down regular-lenght tracks against group usual stance coming up lenghty ones ' twas thing their day , contrary this album ( follow up breakthrough lp crime century ) laid out format comprising 10 tracks ( which would've eleven supposedly , but supertramp sax player john helliwell ( no relations those spice girls , me thinks ) ordains dis-inclusion track " you started laughing " due interest sound quality - given vinyl groove , reasons completely alien incomprehensible less enlightened post- seventies born generation ( that issued b-side " 45 single " lady " , track which succinctly embodied stuff which makes ' tramp great band , they don't give hoot if some would cite them uncool their carnival-like no holds bar type sound which definitely rocks its own way , pitting hodgson band distinctly nothing short themselves defining coolness its most undefiable degree rule within itself )) . prior time copy this lp group even quietest moments , album followed this one major fan ' tramp ( no i'm not speaking trammps who'd ditty called " burn baby burn " ) -- i've mistakenly attributed think some tracks carried this album rather appeared there , such " soapbox opera " , " man woman " . hodgson totally devoid any restriction his own way delivery he pours down " meaning " , which cumulates album poignant conclusion , closer track " two us " ( not beatle title ; however regard mentioned ever fantabulous beatles , this album like its predecessor also produced ken scott who've worked fab-four 1965 legendary lp rubber soul ) . album containing davies ' ( who sports wearing blue shirt his blue suit pictures this album cover inner sleeve following album ' ... quietest moments ... ' ) " ain't nobody but me " , track which displays his dry british wit , one featured singles album - opened similar birds chirping immaculate title track even quietest moments , intro its first track album " easy it " , which easily identifiable intro track open hodgson endearing song " sister moonshine " ( predecessor so akin sorts one their biggest hits " give little bit " , track opened following album ' ... quietest moments ... ' ) , crisis ? what crisis ? outstanding album high caliber kind . i love this album . shouldn't missed . hope they re-issue it out missing " you started laughing " track . significant great work supertramp .	1
this one most relaxing cds i ever heard . combination nature sounds beautiful melodies makes it really easy me relax . it helps me unwind after work sometimes i listen before bed . i quite few cds like this but this one my favorite . gordon brothers masters this kind music . i highly recommend it	1
i found cd source great memories . it took me back school all things girls get their guy or when they lost him . great fun good music ! cd quality also great . there some songs missing ? sure , but it only one cd	1
jesus , what glorious mess this disk . side side some most ridiculous crap i've ever heard my life some most interesting creative melodies i've heard some time . either these guys completely incapable editing themselves , or they simply don't care . " alien lanes " makes it very obvious members gbv , particularly head honcho robert pollard , not discriminate among his various creations . means discerning listeners must job themselves , but my opinion , it ultimately worth trouble . every ridiculous waste my time like " big chief chinese restaurant " or " ex- supermodel " , which features somebody making loud snoring noises throughout track , there many more snippets inspiring genius . " game pricks , " " my valuable hunting knife " " motor away " each deserve featured your local `hit ' radio station , or better yet , cleaned up covered famous band could only wish write something so clever catchy . since pink floyd incapable generating fresh new material , why not cover " always crush me " ? " alien lanes " actually shows band trying bit harder than usual retain some semblance sonic clarity , even stretching out sparingly include some slide guitar violin . look , cd twenty-eight tracks it . 28 !!! yes , good percentage them dismissed , but even if half them extraneous , still leaves fourteen thoroughly worthwhile . i wish they would spend bit more effort focusing what makes their best stuff so good eliminate chaff , but then again , maybe sorting through their output half fun . tom rya	1
" lust life , " which released same year " idiot " should even more successful than record , which iggy first taste commercial success . this album brings back hard-rocking , swaggering tendencies iggy parlayed stooges , although while music isn't quite chaotic , it still damned good record . jim morrison influence also seeps through lot " lust life . " tracks like " passenger , " which iggy wrote based jim morrison poem articulates vision searching many iggy best tunes built . rest tracks rock out make you think , well . " success " ad-libbed sounding iggy pop song could , but it still great piece work , title track , " sweet 16 " others . it good " lust life " finally getting audience it deserved so many years ago . check this record out , you won't disappointed	1

it pretty obvious what going here . one day 80s , record producer living plush apartment manhattan barked out orders one his underlings : " find me beautiful rock singer , blond guy , someone make girls go crazy . also get me out-of-this-world guitarist . i don't care what guy looks like or how ugly he . he look like vampire all i care . important thing he play guitar solos confound everyone -- even editors guitar world magazine . finally , get me drummer bassist big hair . i want them both mullets . otherwise , i don't care too much them so long they don't get way beautiful vocalist freak guitarist . " underling assiduously carried out his task found , respectively , mike tramp , vito bratta , greg d'angelo james lomenzo . tramp spotted walking down street one supermodel each arm . " you sing ? " underling asked . " sure , " tramp said . white lion its singer . underling discovered bratta guitar shop . bratta trying out guitar . 500 people watching awe . guy like yngwie malmsteen steroids . pinch harmonics , sweep arpeggios , 30-note melodic sequences half second , nothing too difficult this fretboard wizard . " you band ? " underling asked . " no , " bratta replied . white lion its guitarist . d'angelo lomenzo recruited movie theater . two sitting together . patrons seated behind them complaining : " we can't see screen because wall hair . " " perfect , " thought underling . once it developed two understood what drums bass , white lion its drummer bassist . now , you might expect group thrown together this fashion would no chemistry would not good . what i would expect . but this group rules ! somehow , against all odds , record producer project successful ! here you some finest rock songs come out mid/late 80s . you amazing sing-along choruses , blistering guitar solos make you shake your head amazement . surprisingly enough , this album also contains coherent songs actually stand their own songs . i probably don't need explain merits " wait " or " when children cry " you , but you also should know three other songs this album ( " lonely nights , " " sweet little loving " " tell me " ) also exceptional . buy this album relive 80s . see yourself it possible formulaic group become great group provided they right attitude talented enough pull it off .	1
i loved this album right start . i sorry see creed dissolve , but i love sound this band . myles kennedy , lead singer , such fantastic vocal range , mark tremonti , lead guitarist , really let it fly here . his playing very tight aggressive ; great stuff . my only complaint this band what hell taking so long get second album out ? come , guys . it three years ; let get move-on here .	1
i loved suede debut album , it true classic . i even bought their b-sides compilation " sci-fi lullabies " loved lot well ( " my insatiable one " might their best song ) . but let honest , this album pretty awful . there maybe 4 or 5 solid tracks here but even they don't touch weakest tracks debu t.t he theatricality amped up tenfold ( if that even possible ) but songwriting taken huge dip . if you want memorable hooks melodies , look elsewhere . if you want slow , pseudo-romantic dirges go absolutely nowhere , then this album you . sure , maybe i just don't " get it " but i don't see how anyone could say straight face this masterpiece , let alone suede best album . this album just boring . i wanted like it but end it just not worth your time . avoid unless you completist	-1

this one most wonderful collections music i've ever listened	1
i only add chorus praise this cd . charlie parker live recordings differ even his best studio work number ways : 1)obviously , solos longer , displaying his amazing fluency inventiveness ; 2)he tended take more risks than studio , which not hard understand ;3 )he gave free play his musical sense humor -- example , stringing together , lightning succession total musical plausibility , quotes " what this thing called love " , " you don't know what love " , " love sale " . also such delights parodies popular songs old new , military marches , " looney tunes " theme song , etc . etc . man apparently total recall every piece music he ever heard , able turn it his purposes . turning this recording particular , it true this stage his career cp often relied pretty heavily stringing together solos his huge store pet runs personal cliches . but what pet runs , what cliches , what stringing together ! i listened lot bird over years , but i found myself gasping speed , drive , diamond-perfect articulation his playing . just piece saxophone playing , it breathtaking . if one compare this recently discovered issued 1945 concert dizzy gillespie , kindest thing one could say there no comparison . 1945 concert he appears off night , while here he very rare form . only thing said favor older concert sound better , but he comes through pretty clearly this cd -- certainly clearly enough amaze delight anyone whose interest primarily astounding music . this recording permanent treasure american music	1
first thing this album careful choice songs . " django " one greatest jazz songs ever written . here , trio gives it great rendition ( one counterpoints version played modern jazz society - full orchestra ) . anyway , this 1956 recording , vince guaraldi piano , eddie duran guitar ( trully great musician !!! ) dean reilly bass . good thing this trio all songs they chose allow us listen geniouses players . there isn't really one solo protagonist . this one those trios who true musical dialogue . pay attention billy strayhorn " chelsea bridge " , gershwin " fascinatin ' rhythm " porter " it de-lovely " . when i first heard this album ... it instant love . very subtle ... it conquer any serious listener .	1
this sound brash young band born musical scene they very marginal tie . andy summers stewart copeland already time other groups ( copeland prog-rocker curved air ! ) sting came academic background . story goes they cut their hair spiky dyed themselves blond tape tv commercial gum ... all while working " roxanne . " so when punky slice pop began chart , image police punks almost accidental . never-the-less , " outlandos d'amour " aggressive way future police albums not . " next you , " " so lonely " " can't stand losing you " big attitude , which fans burgeoning punk scene fed right into . " truth hits everybody " " next you " kicking tempos made you just want jump . band three piece set-up minimum additives ( maybe keyboard " hole my life " some multi-tracked backing vocals ) kept things crisp clean . remastering brings into bright relief this re-issue , reminds us just how startlingly new this all sounded back 1978 . however , like most new bands , all kinks not worked through . silly " sally/be my girl " grew tired after few listens back then hasn't added any charm age . " masoko tango " just sounds like jam tacked record increase running time . but you hear elements eventually grew into brilliance ... reggae touches made " so lonely " " roxanne " so infectious , summers ' mad guitar " peanuts " sting ace songwriting skills . band still sense humor themsleves this moment - just listen flub remained beginning " roxanne . " fact , delete " sally " you could make strong case " outlandos d'amour " five star album ( much same way " mother " blight otherwise brilliant " synchronicity " ) . debut brimmed over excitement things come , police also never rocked this hard again .	1
you got kidding me jodeci . you all tried jodeci . they sound nothing like them . but real this cd striaght garbage . maybe i am much old head , because i grew up jodeci , boyz ii men , kelly , etc . i brought cd very very disappointed music . they need go back school get real job , because singing isn't getting it . you know what i am going try listen cd one more time before i give it away or throw it out window . it shame when you can't even give cd away which i tried several time	-1
creed much loved they maligned . one hand , you their fans , who see them extension alternative movement soaring melodies inspirational lyrics . other , you their critics , who call them " christian band " despise lead singer scott stapp his often unpredictable behavior . while i not condone stapp behavior any way , whole " christian rock " thing summed up two words : who cares ? it bad thing mention god or write inspirational lyrics ? long music this good , well , call me convert . well , first finest . definitely . their later material , human clay weathered , very good , but not match my own prison electicism . this attributed fact this album made before fame , which , unfortunately , went straight stapp head . album also record-setter : four singles , four number #1 hits . these four singles without doubt best songs album , because record-setter , creed should applauded their excellent single selections . these singles : " my own prison " , " torn " , " one " , " what this life " . creed similarities pearl jam striking : both stapp vocal delivery dark undertones surrounding music . i don't think creed trying copy vedder co . per se , but they probably influenced them . i stated before , four best tracks : " my own prison " - dark , moody guitar line stapp harrowing vocals create mezmorizing effect , but star here guitarist mark tremonti . not just his instrumental work , but his singing , he chorus himself . what chorus it , very chant-able ( word ? ) line . " torn " - opener , it influenced greatly alice chains possibly latter-day metallica . it heavy , but you really don't notice it , dark binaural-esque ( pearl jam album ) accompanying music . " one " - greatest track album , perhaps creed greatest song ever . leaded impressive ( hard play ) guitar line , it opens up into arena-ready chorus spiraling guitar solo finish it all off . " what this life " - i'm very sorry say it ; when i first heard it , i thought , " hey , this pearl jam song rocks ! " . it wasn't until chorus when i heard intracacies stapp voice i thought , " i mean ... this creed song rocks ! " . i actually meant compliment , because time , i against creed " copying " pearl jam style , but when i listened it first time without bias , i realized creed made great music . other songs just good ? no . other songs bad , then ? no , stop asking me questions , or i'll slap you upside head ! anyways ... other songs all good their own right , especially impressive " illusion " . i can't honestly say there bad song here ; some , however , feel like they could've more . but no matter , creed started off right foot , , really , only ten tracks , it hard go wrong !	1

you ever stuck computer glitch ? most likely not . but thats how this album make you feel . this most eccentric album i've ever experienced . but kick-you-in-your-teeth-and-solder-computer-chips-in-their-place sort way . first thing you notice ( apart non existent liner notes ) there aren't 9 tracks here . no way . not this baby . when i first put this itunes , it couldnt find track names . i've never happen . thats because there grand total 21 tracks . yes you heard right . but here tricky part , reason why this album not cddb because there string 5 second tracks ( couple minute halfers etc ) make up " song " 8 nobody knows what name them . nobody . but they part what packaging calls " retphase " but you name all them ? i don't even know . that what makes this album so cool . its untraditional so many ways . someone eventually know what name those strings tracks . they'll come up clever naming system or something . but until time , your going go without track names your ipod . but look beyond strange track system this disc you find some best tracks mouse mars recorded so far . it kind dark , sort autechre feel it . those you who know autechre know very good thing . but it still mom . its mom hardcore . there so much going each track you feel mechanized , but they never go too overboard . there still melody heard . you just find it . i'm giving this 5 stars , but rating system , my rating really meaningless . you give this listen your own truly appreciate how far mom really come .	1

although there few gems ( syd dale " penthouse suite " one them ) much music this disc pretty forgettable . it kind stuff cash-strapped tv producers 70s used when they needed soundtrack hip party scenes without paying huge copyright fees . if you like kitschy yet high-quality lounge/easy melodies then you'd much better served buying two-disc " this easy " compilation 2004 . set contains good stuff this album plus whole host memorable evocative instrumental vocal numbers set your toes tappin ' your heart soarin '	-1
i must admit i'm not very much experienced free jazz ; i listened some pharoah sanders some miled davis ' experiments this style ( " cookin ' plugged nickel " or something like ... ) i moderatly impressed moderately confused . i also listened some more recent jazz explorations charlie haden billy higgins , well some recordings art ensemble chicago wayne shorter latest explorations go beyond most traditional achievements ,,, it therefore seemed time i went source ... first all , i am impressed level expressiveness this music ; it no accident coleman liner notes mention new orleans jazz - some his ( but also cherry ) solos brought back some tonal features started disappear early swing era ... i'm not expert but i'm almost certain i heard ornette produce some blue notes his plastic instrument ! naturally , new orleans style one styles jazz which collective improvisation not so uncommon , so it no wonder , attempt free jazz charlie parker magnificent shadow , ornette times went sources jazz . addition , occasional " ethno " influences this album ( not only last song)are continuation usual manners which jazz musicians tried infuse new ideas into their music ; ellington , gillespie others particularly impressed latin america(s ) , there even some middle east experiments , but it time late 50 someone shows influences south asia other sources ... however , i must admit i still dig ornette explanations much more than i dig music ... this fine jazz , strong sense swing , least occasionally , fine drive , but all all , i'm not hypocritical enough hide my opinion band times rambles bit too much ... also , keeping format innitial concluding statement ... well ... anti-melody some songs also doesn't seem such good idea ( much better approach " change century " ... ) . perhaps if i devote more time this style i would get used it or discover more beauty , but now , 4 stars maximum i give ... even bit far fetched , rewarding courage determination follow original path ( regardless number followers ) ...	1

kid virgin megastore turned me this band last week , this first their albums i've chance listen ( their song selection their " late night " contribution convinced me they group some seriously good taste ) . suffice it say i haven't smiled so much long time when i listening this last night . how describe it , though ? maybe captain beefheart meets beatles jams dead then rush shows up ? i don't know , but this music absolute psychedelic blast . it its dark side , but prevailing atmosphere one completely off-kilter fun insanely brilliant instrumental virtuosity placed middle everything-bu t-t he-kitchen-sink mix bound thrill 40-something burnouts like me , nu-hippies , geeks , wads , urban hipsters alike . if such thing possible , i'd liken it tie-died wall sound tastes like one those jolly rancher watermelon hard candies you used eat when you kid . how wall taste like candy ? i didn't know it could until i listened this . jaded , cynical , angry time such ours , i can't imagine how piece music could more subversive ( yes , virginia , that very good thing ) . if you've forgotten why it so much fun your 20s during 70s , pick this up ; this cd made my year . whoo hoo ! now , " soft bulletin " " yoshimi .	1
recorded after ring wars before mare vitalis . this transitional record explains alot how they developed more raw melodic feel mare vitalis raw atmosphere ring wars . this short but sweet record , appleseed cast fans need only apply here . their some very interesting riffs only ac could come up , some realy great vocals chris . only thing their two tracks sound like alot statis some ( very little ) melody them , i don't know why you'd release record slow it down subtle instrumental tracks , but that sorta their thing ( especially llo ) . it still better than most records but no means it complete album . it great gift fans who crave more music this very talented band . look new release this year , if your new them check out ring wars , mare vitalis , their masterpiece low level owl i amp ; ii	1
it shame most people remember crystal two things : don't it make my brown eyes blue her hair . there much more this lady her career than just those two things . this collection brings together bulk her 80s hits warner brothers . few songs this cd yet appeared crystal hits package , so it nice them here . standouts include i don't wanna lose your love , our love fault line , me against night , making up lost time , sound goodbye , incredible cry . i wish all her albums would digitally remastered cd , but least we great sampling her great 80s hits . true love , cage songbird , straight heart three my favorite crystal albums well-represented here	1

folks rhino it again ! what great , well-produced engineered album ! when sax part started playing during " look love " , i could sworn player my living room ! there no doubt david-bacharach songwriting team ranks up there among best ever . " anyone who heart " , " look love " " walk " my favourites still give me great thrills whenever i listen them . so why you may ask only 4 stars ? well , i thought album trifle too short surely they could squeezed " close you " carpenters ! also , i didn't really enjoy first two last two tracks much although they great hits burt , i don't think they really represent his best work . i suppose this meant sampler get you wanna get other rhino releases like 3-disc version and/or " very best dionne warwick " or " dusty memphis " but point made . many , many artistes owe great deal bacharach great songs made them great this decent sampler anyone who wants get know timeless pop aka works art	1

i first heard natalie macmaster 1998 when i blown away track i heard ( catharsis ) local college radio folk music program . i called station ask who , what song , what album , counted myself among nm fans ever since . she amazing talent , who continues work her fiddle ( her voice , really ) like master sculptor sound . said , " yours truly " still took me surprise . this locomotive nm musical development really speeding up - music you practically chew , gravy potatoes side . tracks take you journeys glorious imagination via beautifully constructed arrangements , ranging gentle , soothing melodies those toe-tapping , frenzied , delicious rhythms we all come expect love - fact , one them downright headbanging ! excellent musicians featured this album reminder no matter how exceptional solo artist , she only good band beside her . you almost feel they all inspire each other play their best , their best what you get . this album gave me new appreciation cello hammond organ . some tracks contain so many different instrumental " voices " i almost expected some unpleasant collisions , but what results instead well choreographed acoustic ballet , all sounds skillfully dancing around each other . far michael macdonald rendition " danny boy " concerned - sure it better , but bit imagination , i found it quite warm stirring . ( all you mm anti-fans , don't let one little track stop you , rest cd worth it)the wonderful thing nm she all music , following her own , true instincts despite expectations traditionalists , mainstream listeners or bean-counting record execs . greatest musicians our time ones who courageous talented enough break " rules . " it shame more record companies don't realize . my recommendation : buy it , play it loud , enjoy it , dance it . word caution : put cruise control if you listen this cd your car or you might accidently get speeding ticket .	1
this brilliant live recording 1979 , one all-time great jazz combos , keith jarrett quot ; european quartetquot ; , hidden ecm vault ten years before released 1989 . this always remain huge mystery me , because my opinion this album perhaps jarrett best , certainly most underrated , album . everything this album superlative . compositions ( all jarrett originals ) , without exeption , marvellous , displaying range emotional expressions such beauty ( quot ; prismquot ; , quot ; innocencequot ;) , drama ( quot ; personal mountainsquot ;) , mystery ( quot ; oasisquot ;) playfulness ( quot ; late night williequot ;) . but this music , distinctly timeless nature , conveys so much more than what possible encapsulate few cliched characteristics . solos consistently highest level . jarrett perfectly structured piano solo quot ; prismquot ; quite simply one best solos history recorded jazz . stunning example free-flowing chromatic beauty . understanding inter-play musicians also breathtaking , especially considering this not regular working group . although highly accessible , there depth beauty this music demands endlessly repeated listening . two compositions album ( quot ; oasisquot ; quot ; innocencequot ;) previously released live double-album quot ; nude antsquot ; , recorded only few weeks later than material quot ; personal mountainsquot ; . although quot ; nude antsquot ; nice album , quot ; personal mountainsquot ; far superior almost every sense . sound quality far better , jan garbarek , who not heard top form quot ; nude antsquot ; , delivers one his best ever recorded performances . this makes it even more more puzzling material quot ; nude antsquot ; chosen release ahead quot ; personal mountainsquot ; material . 10-year delay release probably main reason why this album never achieved status it richly deserves , namely one very best small-group recordings jazz history . no less	1
this one started it all . some , it their best work . terms originality ideas , i think this true . terms delivering these new original ideas , they ways go . this body work reveals very young , slightly amatuerish band . album starts off two very good , if not clumsy songs , then really lights it up third song " stairway stars " . it if all pieces just fell together , band just learned how fly formation . my biggest gripe recording . it muddy guitars sound flat . there also too much reverb , drums sound like ringo starr ( al bouchard ) tapping piece cardboard , five miles away . but there much more enjoy this collection than gripe ; album whole very enjoyable , just don't expect sophisticated soundscapes . this low tech rock roll , touch blues , country psychedelia . highlights : " i'm lamb , " " stairway stars " , " last days may " " transmaniacon mc " " workshop telescopes " " redeemed " . great fun , indeed . recommended .	1
my opinion , this definitive dream theater album , encompassing all styles familiar band . it fast aggressive some moments , balanced melodic many more , slow sweet . yes , there soloing , but it fits music . solos journey beyound riffs songs they bring level depth complexity enhances music itself . speaking music , i hadn't heard anything this intelligent since beethoven ninth symphony , i mean all four movements . idea they introduce main themes overture track even reprise opening piece " spirit carries " genius , not mention all riffs themes reprised song " metropolis pt . 1 : miracle sleeper " . fact whole album centered around key -- not unlike , say , classical symphonic work or mozartean opera -- implies this album isn't heard one song time . hearing it beginning end least twice rewarding experience hard repeat ( except maybe hearing it third fourth time ) . finally , this album made many people fans band . people who , before hearing this , would cite depeche mode , simple minds , heaven 17 their favorite bands . i've also made believer my roommate who fan radiohead , red hot chili peppers , social distortion	1
i can't believe people comparing novembers doom opeth . put them both same sentence heresy its most profane , i feel bad even putting both their names this same sentence . first all , opeth far more talented craft epics shatter defy what we know modern music , not mention their contribution re-defining death metal/melodic/doom . novembers doom average best , there no stellar musicianship or amazing epic songs this album , or any other novembers doom albums i heard . pale haunt departure its moments , though far few . every song marred horrid singing cheesy doom talking singer . seriously , his singing sucks ! his screams decent though , you hear his lyrics(which suck repeat same concepts through whole album ie .. not good enough , there tomorrow , blah blah blah ) , but he sounds like cheap immitation amon amarth vocalist . i admit some their guitar riffs pretty good , but they repeat same parts over over , if they could not conjure up decent change ups variations , besides few gems mostly sounds boring . drummer sometimes sounds like he just started drumming , he uses his snare drum way too much doesn't seem know how use it . there few decent drum parts , but nothing spectacular . there virtually no bass all , heard once while , when you hear it , its average . but overall , song structure dynamics horrible poorly put together . i don't see why everyone praises these guys . maybe i just don't get whole doom metal genre its fans , but this album weak weak weak . i agree reviewer who stated intros best parts album , but after you get past 30 seconds each song , song turns into garbage . people so willing give out 5 stars every album . pale haunt departure not worth 5 stars all , more like 2 . pale haunt departure makes me realize anyone make album get signed label	-1
i speechless when i first listened this cd . it totally different anything i've ever heard slater before . he definitely evolved found sound seems suit him perfection . mostly funky electro , but you totally recognize slater techno influences throughout cd , which takes it level . every single track amazing beautifully constructed . this cd definitely worth checking out	1

man who never claimed jazz guitarist , he lays it down fine form this compilation . his unique chord-melody technique shines many numbers , his underrated single-note playing completely masterful . excellent backing piano , bass , drums ( different personnel two recording sessions , 1960 1961 ) . material ranges swing era ( gershwin , rodgers-hart , ellington ) showtunes even monk . my only beef this disc some minor intonation problems toward end one recording session -- i find myself saying quot ; come , johnny , tune pianoquot ; couple cuts . ok , so maybe this 4 1/2 stars , but this representation real johnny smith makes it more than worthwhile	1

now if you ask me , pleny auronautical fans now again rgular occurance , this here album title kind mystifying . wing designed withstand pressures going speed sound it pretty tough . we got some aeroplanes what it , but they got special wings made super-dooper materials . i reckon this here paul mccartney wings album much same way . see , he managed pull four singles off this album 1976 they included " let ' em " " silly love songs " which right up there top pile ( if you axe me ) . i enjoy listening this one when i'm out shed working something like rebuilding linkages brush hog , or tamping down flue port-a-smelter . this one puts me mood start workin ' just-a-keep-on workin ' - so i call this one my " workin ' album .

piano remains me greatest musical invention . one great musical challenges any musician tackle quot ; standardquot ; . mr pletnev it carnegie hall 1st november 2000 when he made magnificent again , beethoven piano sonata no 32 , op . 111(documented dg 471157-2 ) . mr mehldau it his series albums entitled art trio his latest ( double ) cd documents some music he made over three nights village vanguard during september 2000 . times i feel his incisive , searching , surprising ballad playing his great strength ( cf folks who live hill , disc 1 , track 3 ) but then he reworks alone together into uptempo piece preceded stunning piano solo introduction then staccato piano phrases punctuated drums bass delivering musical exploration very edge its form 15 minutes musical delight . then disc 2 track 2 absolutely exquisite , achingly beautiful reworking ( originally strikingly banal)secret love . my view mr mehldau no tricks , no theatre , no look-at-me-and-what-i-can-do bravura , no cliches , no licks , but all music . he one very few pianists i listen who gives impression music speaking through him , this how it . music doesn't get much better than made mr mehldau , mr genadier mr rossy	1

one reviewers below suggests , i'm starting think you really alive 60s , preferably highly sentient 1972 , realize what absolute masterpiece this , perhaps one qualification . major one me truly appreciate fsol one " conceptualize " each their releases terms initial album ( i.e dead cities ) subsequent " translations " followed ( i.e. my kingdom case dc ) view them inseparable " whole . " such , when i think fsol " isness , " i view it three disc set consisting original album , " mello hippo disco show " " otherness . " now , light kind music fsol making here , look both backwards ( into your record collection ) sideways ( what other artists doing presently ) . what compares this ? sgt . pepper ? meddle ? court crimson king ? larks tongues aspic ? red ? close edge ? go back give them listen , great they , prepared surprised . radiohead ? daft punk ? orb ? only if you're kind nut who thinks joe strummer " really " better guitarist than jeff beck still . fsol something here very much like what dj shadow entroducing , except they used their brains instead turntable . my ears , this most intelligent , coherent , " collageist " summing up everything wonderful progressive rock ( anybody who says " prog " showing their youth ) psychedelia one could wish . song song breakdown would tedious , i'm not any way slighting incredible stuff like " dead cities , " which i consider their masterpiece . one might add if this album missing anything , its some awesome rhythmic impact their best work . but this masterpiece well , completely unlike anything else out there present . if you ever wondered what your favorite progressive bands might they not burned out ( am i only one who thinks white album three sides too long or adrian belew should tried crimes against music ? ) pick up all three fsol most recent releases listen them if they part same album . this far music taken when moved direction suggested best late 60s 70s . i'm definitely not sensitive , 90s kind guy , but this album frequently brings tears my eyes , its so incredibly , unexpectedly perfect . nothing else outside " classical " music ultra-progressive jazz like coltrane " ascension " or " meditations " me anymore . this falls into line every other fsol release more absolutely beautiful ( not same thing " pretty " ) stuff it than just anything else released during last 40 years . comparing this band such forgettable acts supertramp elo , editorialist above , like blasting bach partita solo violin d-minor no good tunes : sheer idiocy . me , i'll still listening this loving it nursing home when young kids using radiohead cd drink coasters . if you still proper stereo , owning playing these three discs make you glad you don't most your music listening computer terminal ( that depressing think on-line gambling ) . beautiful , magnificent , yes , timeless stuff , not missed , especially if you're old enough remember when smoking allowed grocery stores	1
sounds created tld floods your ears keeps things interesting powerful beat . imagine rammstein english , more taste . it like soda bubbles bursting your tongue , irresistable voice commanding taunting your very existence . i'd never heard them before i saw them live knitting factory . they only opening act but far best band played night . stage he really taunts crowd holding out mic stand even going so far walk around pit roll duct tape . singer ridiculous charm . especially 30 some year old . important aspect this album it not like traditional " goth " music . don't let cover decieve you -- ask yourself our culture stress beauty , self-glorification , human ego . lyrics ring true our deepest human natures	1

if you grew up times old school hip hop onward , you recognize all tracks this album . best cut far slick rick " hey young world , " but every song good . i gave it four stars because while it very good , it not perfect . i say not perfect because all big jazz names album(roy hargrove , gerald albright , hubert laws rick braun name few ) , their appearances album alone sets expectation bar pretty high . although they all great job , it wasn't absolute best work they could put , therefore it perhaps two or three steps away perfect . horn arrangement jay-z " i get ... " struggled match energy original track known . method man " bring pain , " i looking forward hearing original beat , but they changed it up some point where i couldn't audibly recognize it until vocals came . also , since rick braun there it would good kirk whalum somewhere album too . but that really only major flaws i found album . " hey young world " perfectly , even go-go/reggae feel it . " all i need " excellent , they go waaaaaayyy back oran juice jones ' " rain . it really good album . not perfection , but definitely not waste money	1
i admit i am subdude newbie , but if this album any indication band prior work i lot look forward . this cd wearing out my cd player . i bought it when it first came out but i just started listening it during school finals i writing papers , i must say , it pulled me through some long nights . album highlighted last song quot ; bye-bye , quot ; it oh so sweet harmonies , bitter-sweet lyrics . my favorite subdudes songs , quot ; all time worldquot ; here , but unfortunately it doesn't hold up . slide guitar woefully out tune , but only low point otherwise phenominal album	1

i've owned this album ( originally its british lp release ) since early 1970 , it never lost its freshness worth . this one moment time , winwood mason really worked together , combination winwood/mason/wood/capaldi one most eclectic original popular music . mason consummate pop-song writer , roots folk english music-hall , " here little song " , " feelin ' allright " , " don't sad " " cryin ' heard " all quality songs beautifully executed . " feelin'allright " got covered many times , but me original version here best -- it rocks , it light airy , it sense humor . there several moments this record when mason winwood voices overlap , i'm reminded just how good they sounded together . listen codas " don't sad " " cryin'to heard " particular . but core this group winwood/wood/capaldi , it this unit puts together one most striking ( musically ) track all , " no time live . " it starts wood sax , sounding almost like animal-cry la paul winter ( many years earlier ! ) , capaldi comes playing tom-toms , winwood organ laces wispy lines his unique , soulful voice begins lyric . lyrics never winwood/capaldi long-suit ( capaldi wrote most them ) , self-consciously world-weary words this song hardly memorable , but song itself undeniable power . wood original , excellent reed-player , never better than this album or this song particular . capaldi shows again what sensitive percussionist he , his alternating textures beautiful stick-brushed-cymbal work this cut ( idea rock group would " sensitive percussionist " its drummer 1968 almost absurdity ) . reality , virtually every reviewer noted already , traffic never just rock band . its basic sound keyboard-based rather than guitar-based ( although both winwood mason shine guitar this album ) , winwood/wood/capaldi interests ran into far more diverse areas , all which come bear here this album . later traffic efforts might emphasize extended rock/fusion-jam aspect more , line-up would shrink expand , but traffic would never sound better than it studio 1968 when they recorded this album .	1
if you truly love oasis if you relate their music , then there no good or bad album , only slightly better ones . they haven't voted best brit pop group past decade no reason ! i am eagerly awaiting stop clocks	1
this best armstrong album ever ! one things sets it apart music . backbone this album made up traditional jazz numbers , not pop songs show up so many his albums . it shame armstrong much more known latter . furthermore , enthusiastic european crowds inspired band play it best . clearly everybody good time . i can't understand why it took so long this album reissued	1

this probably ricky martin best album right now . it least 4 us releases ( livin ' la vida loca , bella ( she all i ever ) , shake your bon-bon , cup life ) mainstream it , it deservedly receives lot interested fans . i think i even heard private emotion radio . blending lyrics music production releases not overly . if you're looking complex or extremely witty lyrics , this not album you then . lyrics music accentuate cd themes romantic love spirits accomplishment . shake your bon-bon way too corny , but besides track , other ones much more presentable natural ricky martin . some unreleased songs may too spanish sounding too similar sounding mainstream audience . they too similar sounding me too sometimes . she all i ever private emotion definitely capture contemporary pop well , private emotion sounds like big hit . probably hit big non-us countries . livin ' la vida loca cup life both cool flair that not just put together like some backstreet boys songs . suggested anyone who likes well music based entirely production vocals	1
basically took bunch great songs , dumbed them down , made them all sound same , made them very boring process . there nothing unique any songs , they really boring covers you might expect see some 18 year old freshman college who obsessed belle sebastian cover coffee shop . boring , trite , nice effort but try again please .. i think worst cover slaughter guns brixton . undertones cover here pretty bad , too ... i don't know , i didn't fancy this . if you like boring yet somehow hip music , this may your cup tea . you should probably get garden state soundtrack too , would great those boring days your dorm or coffee shop your soy vanilla latte ... bad shot irony	-1
sleepy , drifty quality synthesizer sounds employed this album , really mark it product 70 . younger or less experienced electronic music fans might not take this kind thing , seeing how it utterly lacks anything even remotely approaching break , cut , or drum machine . but electronic music classicists , it doesn't get much better . typical most vangelis , old or new , artist applies classical composer skills electronic medium , unique savory effect . track 7 especially beautiful , its extended length delicate harp . vangelis ( my opinion ) oft-overlooked musical genius late 20th century , rivaling more traditional composers like john williams terms ability style . get this album experience his gift , prior world spotlight shown down man quot ; chariots firequot ;	1
this one best albums i've purchased last couple years . i enjoy every single song . i not get tired listening this . i first discovered rocco deluca burden seeing them live opening act . i didn't know them but very impressed his skill dobro - which very difficult instrument master . i immediately bought album i love it . use dobro make it fresh . rocco voice phenomenal he strong songwriting skills . album successfully blends different genres makes it all " work . " there rock , blues , alternative , punk , americana other genres influencing sound . he grounded americana music knows history music which big influence his style . there good blend mellow up-tempo stuff . i saw them second time live even more blown away than first time . definitely see them live if you get chance ! i saw interview reason track " i trust you kill me " not album because it homage zeppelin other bands who titled their album song but then put actual song album . hint : you get track live ep itunes . thank you ironworks putting out band grounded rock blues	1
i really like comment reviewer below , mr. adams , who said project evans cannonball strove quot ; mellow , but swinging foundationquot ; . this precisely what achieved , this also why i like riverside recordings ( orrin keepnews producer ) so much . then relatively mid-sized label seemed not only make most right moves decisions , but also get exactly what needed personnel their roster - best . this one best concepts - record cannonball evans together ; team them perfect rhythm duo occasion percy heath connie kay , well feature compositions which fit groove decided upon . it true - long everything ran planned , session ' gimme ' . it turned out lot more than . it turned out classic . cannonball well-established reputation , keepnews notes , what allowed this happen first place ( he little humble , he his label saw possibilities ) , this classic , different it almost any cannonball before or after , good cannonball recording ever made . you could remaster this 20,000 bit ... it wouldn't matter . it would sound great mono	1
this music makes you want get up dance ! first few tracks best , but whole cd very good . i could not stop listening son fro africando many more . hide this cd because once you pop it , your friends never want give it back you . after owning gypsy caravan , afro-latino , afro latin party , salsa around world , cuba many more i come say this one best putumayo we seen up date . also check out putumayo colombia-it sure get you dancing like you never danced before !	1
well , powerslave certaintly contender title painkiller judas priest don't break oath mercyful fate . this album step up heaviness song writing piece mind number beast , which my opinion bit over-rated compared powerslave . there isn't moment through powerslave i get even relatively bored . not one . it just good . no metal collection complete without this . favorite tracks : aces high , losfer words ( big ' orra ) , rime ancient marine	1
movie good but music spectacular , fresh provocative . standouts wendy lisa , enya , grace jones ( gulp ! ) i cannot listed closing year enough , anyone know where i get cd single this gem ? i heard extended version it better	1
after mildly disappointed deadwing , i reservation porcupine tree latest album . however , after initial listen i am pleased report pt finally managed find perfect balance their older atmospheric prog their newer , heavier traits . steven wilson fine form this album , musically it astonishing . swirling vortex guitars , masterful drums courtesy mr. harrison , dreamy soundscapes lush synths combine create familiar pt sound , but this time around there absolutely no filler , entire album remains focused cohesive start finish . only room improvement lyrics , which aren't bad any means but some reason they don't grab me quite much past albums . concept original unique , little more easily understood than sometimes opaque themes previous records . if you're fan older porcupine tree you pleased know this album little less song-oriented little more atmospheric free-form than last two . if you're newer porcupine tree fan you'll please know this albums add more heaviness grind , but finds zen-like balance two . instead heavier sections tacked onto lighter songs , fear blank planet morphs raging beast soothing angel completely effortlessly seamlessly . i can't wait see where this band goes next .	1
i recently rented movie il postino fell love it ! music , poetry , story , all opened my eyes whole new interest italian culture . it wonderful because addition movie soundtrack , cd more than 12 poems recited actors music movie playing background	1
monk albums john coltrane great - no doubt - but when i heard this album first time recently i knocked out . it confirmed my belief johnny griffin not recognition he deserved . he isn't alone . i love benny golson he too overshadowed . problem not just trane ; it ornette colman certain extent eric dolphy . they ' weird ' compared straight-ahead bop-and-bluesmen ( like magnificent griffin ) took critical limelight . sure , ' weird ' fellows often made good music ( mr coltrane particular said his moments ! ) but now we know there other stuff going too . hearing monk grif now like hearing new jazz very highest order , passage time freed music confusing contemporary comparisons . it great - buy it ! apparently there same band same place i pleasure still come - thank you god	1
terms commercial success , bread still going strong into 1973 , but it easy see why david gates would wanted go solo . quite simply , it seems though he really wanted able devote entire album his own material not share space james griffin , which perfectly understandable , not only because gates ' enormous amount talent , but also due personal nature this album . griffin doesn't appear " first " , but david other bread bandmates larry knechtel mike botts here , which very telling indeed -- said , it seems utterly clear bread broke up mainly due tension griffin gates . addition knechtel botts , gates some big name west coast session musicians here including larry carlton , louie shelton , jim gordon , russ kunkel . it very fitting " first " solo album -- not only david write produce all tracks himself , but there very personal confessional nature many these songs that striking . instance , there wistful , gentle album-opener " sail around world " , really moving bittersweet song coming grips things you'd really like life , but probably won't ever chance . " i use soap " great tune curiously matches upbeat , country-flavored acoustic music reflective quite mournful lyrics , although he end song ray optimism future . " sunday rider " nice rocker escapist lyrics uncannily bring mind jackson browne , though browne yet reach his peak time this album . gates finally whole album himself , you clearly see him using opportunity branch out , it often great effect . he puts van morrison , not mention chicago , shame " help way " , rousing incredibly catchy jazz-rocker cautionary lyrics telling us not get too wrapped up race against time . he brings back jazzy sound album-closer , sumptuous blissful " lorilee " , presumably written one his children--it largely instrumental , great chord changes instrumental soloing , although it sound strikingly similar allman brothers band " memory elizabeth reed " . gates even steps into progressive rock territory extremely impressive " suite : clouds , rain " , almost undoubtedly his most imaginatively-arranged piece music ever -- it opens sound effects , then david comes playing lovely , melancholy piano theme before joined orchestral accompaniment . goosebump-inducing " clouds " released its own single--it dreamily transcendant song masterful use moog synthesizer . all said , it would certainly exaggeration say " first " marks clean break bread sound . instance , " ann " very much sounds like it could bread album ; it written one his daughters -- unfortunately , lyrics quite obvious sappy , although there no denying it very nicely melodic sincerely sung . easy-going , country-flavored " sight sound " pleasant song kind lines " sweet surrender " . unfortunately , gates falters " you believe he comin '" which annoying , self-righteously religious lyrics gospel-style background vocals . positive side , this tune wonderful coda reprises intro " suite : clouds , rain " . despite flaws , " first " still highly recommended album comes tantalizingly close masterpiece -- gates ' diversity ability follow through his ambitions truly impressive , much great music he would continue make after this , it still kind shame he never even tried make album combined adventurous departures his more trademarked style sprawling , unifying feel . it figures this album big commercial disappointment , not even reaching top 100 us album chart , because david gates makes it abundantly clear here he far more than mere commercial hack certain people like accuse him . ( p.s. this cd version " first " marred print back cover which damn near impossible read .	1
i very impressed first two volumes series but this volume , while it some great tracks , not match those two although i like this set better now than when i first bought it some years ago . highlights me i saw three ships ( sting ) , blue christmas ( sheryl crow ) , christmas ( blues traveller ) , gallic version silent night ( enya ) , santa claus back town ( jonny lang ) , christmas now drawing near hand ( steve winwood ) o holy night ( tracy chapman ) . most other tracks ok but version santa baby included here definitely not my kind music . i much prefer madonna version , found first volume series , or original eartha kitt version fifties . if you big fan nineties pop rock music , you may enjoy this more than i , my taste pop rock rooted earlier era . otherwise , you likely feel ( i ) this not essential purchase . you contribute special olympics purchasing first two volumes ( also filled mostly pop rock music ) or more recent very special acoustic christmas ( filled country bluegrass music ) , all which i reviewed long ago	1
i picked this novel up whim long ago during my trekkie phase , i pleasantly surprised it . not only it bring back memorable characters tos cast tng universe , it incorporates them their motivations way shows never really . story deals spock finally coming under romulan capture during his lengthy task reunification . held ambitious governor , he scheduled executed his followers , thus stage set political intrigue philosophical side novel . starfleet response swift sure . spock amazing memory , 150 years top-level federation secrets locked within his mind . security threat staggering . thus , one spock old friends -- certain doctor leonard mccoy -- brought aboard flagship enterprise help negotiate prisoner release before romulans discover spock among unificationists . same time , retired engineer genius montgomery scott intercepts message starfleet enterprise , decided go after spock himself . , he needs ship , so pure scotty fashion , steals ancient constitution class starship hopes getting spock out romulan territory himself . novel joy read , so i won't say much more . i say , though , this book really captures adventure feel original series amazing characters next generation . dealing these relics past , clash tactics comes fore , end it mesh those tactics philosophies finally needed -- but stubborn people both crews times able meet middle ground ? it interesting though , explored fairly well	1
perhaps consequence ambition savaged critics fans alike . quot ; consequencesquot ; torn shreds many critics its pretentions when it first released . narrative double disc album , it featured story nature rebelling against man songs instrumentals godley creme who recently left 10cc . while ambitious , yes , perhaps pretentious sprawling album offered something music hadn't seen awhile -- artist attempting something large scale wit intelligence . drawback quot ; consequencesquot ; its reliance , perhaps , too much narration talented peter cook when fans come expect something different godley creme . quot ; music consequencesquot ; came market salvage disasterous reception duo album double concept album . it focused primarily songs instrumentals bit narration cook hold it all together . whole , it works equally well original double album . best songs very much equal what duo accomplished within 10cc . quot ; 5 o'clock morningquot ; stands , perhaps , best track album its observations life working person . quot ; lquot ; other hand didn't ambition quot ; consequencesquot ; but it just much creativity going . quot ; englishman new yorkquot ; features godley creme sarcastic wit its best galloping melody vocal delivered kevin godley reminds me quot ; dean iquot ; terms its ambitious scope musical changes . it not perfect album but benefit better , more focused quot ; messagequot ; than quot ; consequencesquot ; . featuring gutarist phil manzanera ( roxy music , 801)on many tracks , album shows duo zappaesque word play musical invention frequently top form . while this edition lacks bonus tracks seen other reissues ( each others anywhere 4 8 tracks each cd ) , it great compilation two fine albums this often forgotten creative duo . godley creme wouldn't hit us until their next last album ( quot ; history mixquot ;) innovative quot ; cryquot ; ( which benefited original video directed duo themselves)and good song , these two albums their best even better . i'd give quot ; music consequencesquot ; 4 stars quot ; lquot ; 4 1/2 . remastering both albums comparable us releases ( where quot ; consequencesquot ; released its entirety two disc cd quot ; lquot ; combined witty quot ; freeze framequot ;) .	1
well i loved creed sad they split up so i gave alter bridge chance there great no doubt it they . so now scott stapp returned surprising good album me , before album came out i hear relearn love passion christ soundtrack scott i never liked track so i bit worried scott . but then i heard great divide single which i must say great song its got creed feel it lyrics great song . there tracks this album which you would think creed songs like fight song sounds like freedom fighter , but start finish this overall solid effort scott stapp its really good album it creed feel it but then again he lead singer one greatest bands ever my opinion . i'm sad creed no longer but long four them alive make great music weather its alter bridge or scott stapp solo stuff i always fan because they amazing musicians .	1

this album miracle . i could stop here you enough words understand level this album belongs . i'm bored when i read reviews where people point out music too technical or stuff like this . this music technical sure but it absolutly marvellous totally blazing emotional level . this album trip . when i listen this one sometimes i find myself unable listen nothing else while . technique not against emotions especially albums like this one ! if you not skilled enough appreciate beauty these players produced here , please , don't write reviews ! this album flamenco , jazz , classical , latin , it simply three mindblowing musicians united produce last word acoustic guitar music unbelievable chapter history music . but this album not only incredible guitarists , it fantastic everyone because songwriting amazing . credits go three them infact they choosed record tunes each one them ( two tunes each ) i can't say which best !! every tune perfect sequel one preceed it . it seems it written one single pen . this cd even fantastic audio experience if you good hi end system . even if tones could better , dynamic there you hear each player different channel , so you john centre , paco right channel al left channel . you recognize easily their different styles . you follow dialogs they improvising these marvellous tunes . i own this one since 1990 i guess . it still impress me technical abilities solos compings , it still amazes me songwriting skills these guys , delight me emotional level each time i decided take it out vaults . gem	1

most recordings i heard sonatas harpsicord violin use harpsicord not piano . one things happens harpsicord tends get " lost " violin such more powerfull instrument . here roles both equall pianist ( glen gould ) strong personality makes himself felt music . interaction gould laredo electric . both formidable artist together they create fireworks . 1014 allegro example which sounds quite layed back biondi disk here really rocks - you can't help humming it ( way i can't here gould humming anything ) . i prefer this version penguin rosetted grumiaux version ( harpsicord gets lost ) highly regarded biondii version ( boring ) . i guess it not authentic but gould brings out beauty , liveliness complexity bach better then any other pianist i know laredo exellent violinist . i havn't time listen concertos rose yet end offering . this may not " reference " but if you going buy one recording these works then buy this one	1

i can't believe " future without past " unknown underappreciated it . i count one hand number rap albums consistently funny entertaining this one . this album simply phenomenal throughout . three mcs here fantastic . busta rhymes would course go quick-lipped apocalyptic mainstream mc , but here he hilarious , immature teen . dinco dean carries weight one who gels busta equally zany funny charlie brown , whose yelling chanting make him one who really stands out . cut monitor milo makes beats , assorted group other producers , raps occasion . lons joy listen because they celebrate youth , quite capable tackling issues youth world amidst their crazy humor . production excellent , using samples creative instrumentals make unique yet simple sound doesn't sound slightly dated fifteen years later . i can't think group so much character charisma . " future without past " concept album follows busta , dinco , charlie through day school . these guys hysterical thoughts goings high school , i laugh frequently whenever i listen this . this album must-have any fans 90s classic hip hop . skits part what make concept work so well make album so much fun . beginning " homeroom , " which guys skirting into school amid some sort riot , classic song " case pta " plays school theme perfectly , poking fun school system over legendary production infectious chorus . " too much my mind " allows mcs voice problems their teenage lives , horn-laden hook . " what pinocchio theory ? " crazy hilarious , anchored charlie brown . despite its standard fun , " just when you thought it safe ... " displays social consciousness only best mcs 1991 . after visit " lunchroom " incredible " sound zeekers , " crazy song multiple guest rappers . " sobb story " great , " feminine fatt " funny song where busta speaks happily heavyset women . i love " transformers , " " afterschool " lons ask role models " show me hero . " " planes , trains , automobiles " infectious fast , well-produced executed " international zone coaster . " self explanatory " teachers , don't teach us nonsense " precedes busta hilarious " my dingaling . " album closes perfect " where we go here ? " much success busta rhymes would later find , my opinion this far his greatest accomplishment . " future without past " amazing . it unbelievably funny , musically catchy , simply entertaining best hip hop . fans tribe called quest , de la soul , even brand nubian or wu-tang should pick this up without thinking twice , they see lons group unique enjoyable any . this album never received its due respect but must-have any hip hop fan	1

" leg lamb " , " better living through chemistry " , " fade " , contrary name " lightning song " slightly slower tracks but all them full intensity , powerful licks lyrics . those who like heavier stuff check out " tension head " . all all this album full great songs variety . righteous cd must everyone	1
catch fire , bob marley wailers , first reggae album show genre serious form music outside jamaica , par american british rock roll rb . before this 1973 breakthrough , reggae seen something joke . even though jimmy cliff " harder they come " set stage , " catch fire " clinched it . album solid classic masterpiece lead vocals not just marley , but bandmate peter tosh well , tracks " 400 years " " stop train " . deluxe edition features both original " catch fire " album , released only jamaica december 1972 its two bonus tracks well original album released internationally public may 1973 , both songs like " stir it up , " " no more trouble , " well underrated classic " baby we've got date ( rock it baby ) " , my favorite song album . both also astonishing difference sound two subtle , yet extremely visible , adding album charm legendary status . " catch fire " leave you begging more .	1

i've listening alternative music since 1980s . suddenly late 1980s/early 1990s , record companies suddenly recognized " commercial value " alternative groups . result , creativity unusual nature performers marked alternative music homogonized into stale pablum same-soundingness . or , so i thought . montreal " satanic panic attic " one my favorite albums all time . i've rediscovering alternative groups sound/feel lot like old school alternative groups like " montreal " " blonde redhead " slipped my notice . thank god word mouth , or i would never heard them . first time i introduced this group through girl who i swapping music recommendations . she apologized lead singer voice some reason , but let me listen sample eros ' entropic tundra , it love first listen . not everyone like this , i'm sure . their sound retro low-fi . songs quirky , strange , giddy mix beach boys ' layered melodies/harmonies odd subjects epic openings/closings usually marked beatles ' music . i know i love album when i keep hitting repeat my stereo relisten song because i enjoy it so much . my favorites frequent repeat this album " disconnect dots , " " lysergic bliss , " ( adorable ! ) " rapture rapes muses , " " eros entropic tundra , " " erroneous escape into eric eckles , " " your magic working " " spike senses . "	1
this isn't my favorite album theirs , but overall it still very good . my ears , " into labyrinth " bit more earthy , tribal sound than some their other albums . not every track , but many . i would call " yulunga " best thing here , it beating drums ancient vibe , it single after all amazing video even . " umbiquitous mr. lovegrove " probably closest thing pop song , though not one , i really love track " spiders stratagem " , it reminds me old dcd . i'd call this disc must previous fans , newcomers might enjoy collection more	1
just like many other metal bands hair metal bands eighties worked very limited musical territory . still they created something fresh different made opportunity listener think something else than death , philosophy suicide get into territory where partying just fun great time headsubjct both within lyrics within music . i would never aloud myself class anything hair metal era world class musicianship , something more original deeper fulfilled . but doesn't say i don't like music , i actually really enjoy some it very much , heart young i consider one best albums within genre . its mix music created english rock group def leppard swedish rockers europe it fills all criterias what good hair metal album should include , making us remember sunny party days eighties ( re-do them ) , just great time .	1
one best cd i ever purchased . love it !! love it !! love it !	1
this album takes me right back 1982 . before madonna , michael all those wonderful ' 80 songs , there this gem . aside overplayed title track , every song this album strong my memory this day . give listen " ever since world began " try get it out your head . survivor " journey steroids " both powerful rock hooks ( hesitation dance)and melodic power ballads ( silver girl ) . 5 stars also lead vocals dave bickler . most important reasons buy this album right now ... well worth money you'll want play it over over again .	1
project 1950 awesome !!!! i really like great balls fire , monster mash , most all this magic moment . i would greatly recommend you buy this cd . buy it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
after getting their latest album ( ahundreddaysoff ) going back this cd refreshing . this truely their most amazing work yet . all sounds underworld mastered over their past few albums , beaucoup fish brings together perfect blend all them , but much more refined . no more raw drum beats carry song , but instead , they've got entire novel written each song . if there any cd my collection i would reccommend first anyone , it would this one	1
both these recordings beethoven fourth sixth made hollywood 1958 , same time walter turning rather slack unfocused readings other symphonies . here he recovers some dash intensity marked his 1930s pastorle vienna phil . columbia sym . plays energy inflection , even though walter tempos leisurely side . generally acknowledged , he found magic every movement pastorale , which surely stand best romantic versions this symphony ( far more charming than bohm often recommended but unsmiling recording dg ) . fourth same mode , more incisiveness than his eroica , fifth , or seventh . but walter somewhat less alert here ; result mellow performance good if not superb quality . newcomers might suppose , hearing these performances , rest walter beethoven must equal stature . it not , but we grateful this charmed moment his old age . look his bruckner , mozart , mahler similar inspiration	1
this one my all time favorite mariah carey albums . lyrics superb her singing mind-blowing . i whole heartedly recommend this any mariah fan	1
chess several incarnations -- chicago edition , original british version , this original broadway ( american ) cast . tim rice thought idea musical wrote lyrics during 1980s , it kind became his obsession ; i.e. chess tim rice e.t. steven spielberg star wars george lucas . rice corraborated project half abba ( benny anderson bjorn ulvaeus ): they wrote music what beautiful music it . show only broadway 3 months ( apr-june ) 1988 before cancelled . perhaps because cold war waning , but time there didn't seem much audience it . however , cold war ended 16 years ago show grown status over years . musical tells story american chess player ( loosely based upon bobby fischer ) his russian counterpart . american lover coach leaves him russian . russian professes his love , but he torn because he already wife children back homeland . play portrays russian victim , but if you really think it , he not . i find music show particularly moving many lyrics haunting . " where i want " , " nobody side " , " i know him so well " , " pity child " all wonderful songs , tainted melancholy . " one night bangkok " actually became international pop hit . however , main reason i like this album more than other versions show inclusion song " someone else story " . there just seems so much depth emotion song it stirs something my soul everytime i hear or sing it . most fans chess prefer more rock driven british version album . however , " heaven help my heart " call me red , white , blue yankee because " endgame " i like this album chess best	1

mariah second album " emotions " great follow up her eponymous debut 1990 . biggest diffrent ben margulies co-wrote most songs her debut changed walter afanasieff who going feature many upcoming mariah albums future , he also wrote her big hit " hero " 1993 . legendary carole king also co-wrote one song put some debth into it . musically " emotions " mix great ballads uptempo soul/gospel songs . all those liked early mariah albums " emotions " welcolmed your hearts too . album starts title track " emotions " soulish uptempo feautures backround choirs , it also best song album , it reached #1 charts . no wonder it catchy uptempo considering co-writers part euro-dance group cc music factory . " you don't remember " typical affanasieff ballad , same " can't let go " my second favorite , it top 5 hit . robert clivill�s/david cole cc music factory also co-wrote 4th song here " make it happen " also dance number also top 5 . " if it over " co-written carole king , it great gospel infleunted songs very beautiful . " you're so cold " dance number . " so blessed " wonderful shows what wonderful voice mariah got , unless you didn't already know . " around you " yet catchy uptempo , but somehow gospel infleunced . " til end time " slowest ballads all here , yes it co-written walt , who else ? " wind " also superslow feautures piano . these 2 songs aren't best though . overall , not many surprises . mariah just proved she could come up second album , almost good her debut . probably little more variation this far more uptempo then her debut more song writers but not just good her first , but very good album nonetheless . anyone who likes her , won't dissapointed if they pick up this one	1

after seeing film quot ; romy amp ; michele ... quot ; i buy soundtrack i quite pleased it . some songs cd better than lot songs come out today . quot ; gogo'squot; , quot ; tears fearsquot ; amp ; belinda carlisle my favourites listen cd , but cd not flaw free . some cheesy songs i never cared like quot ; i want candyquot ; or quot ; cruel summerquot ; included , but that matter personal opinion . some people may annoyed some more prominant songs featured movie not included like quot ; time after timequot ; amp ; quot ; footloose . quot ; however , what annoyed me most version belinda carlisle quot ; heaven place earthquot ; put cd . i never remembered song sounding way before , so next day i bought belinda carlisle album quot ; heaven earthquot ; indeed original album version there much better . i found out later version song this soundtrack actually remix called quot ; heavenly versionquot ; , how it got put here instead i'll never know(incidentally version film original album version ! ) . i no idea if any other songs here remixes , but if you planning buying cd belinda carlisle song , you'd better off buying her quot ; heaven earthquot ; album or greatest hits album . other than cd great nostalgic listen	1

once something canada doesn't suck . kittie debut album " spit " we get see other side gender coin watch 4 women show men what up . although kittie might not most original band universe , it nice get change usual stuff radio time . aside my hometown girl metal band ( babes toyland ) , i wasn't buying into women lead singers heavy metal bands . this cd quickly shut my mouth . since i first bought this cd , it remained one my favorites . " spit " whole emotionally disconnected kick crotch delivered sometimes sweet voiced sometimes growling morgan lander ( vocals/guitar ) , fallon bowman ( guitar ) , talena atfield ( bass ) mercedes lander ( drums ) . this cd 12 tracks heavy guitars , low almost death metal like bass double bass drum percussion occasional slipknot-esque sampling . songs like " spit " , " charlotte " " whore " give you their insight mature subjects like men , relationships rape . normally , i don't like favorite tracks album or rate each song because i think it takes away album whole but my 2 top songs this disc " brackish " " paper doll " . brackish one songs i referred very slipknot-esque . lot sampling production there it probably best track where fallon bowman back up vocals . " paper doll " just disturbing creepy . there remix version this song made it radio . sorry but only original version album . overall , this very good cd . very few cd ever leave my rotation this one never left . me personally , album hang me it gotta good or close slipknot , system down , tool , anything slayer old school anthrax pantera . yes i'm gambling high even suggest kittie could hang these great bands . i wouldn't necessarily say they best band or even best girl band but , " spit " just good album cd itself hangs some my other bands ( talk dancing around equality men women ) . anyway , i give this album 3.8 its enjoyable , listenable style metal . again , kittie not most original band ever but what it , this album pretty good .

dan fogelberg singer-songwriter who his creative feet several musical worlds , spanning rock , pop , country folk . he never flashy artist , coming across almost shy more focused his art than caught up media hype so seems snare so many musicians . fogelberg throw back days when music more honest familiar , modern minstrel singing please himself whatever audience listen . this album begins " part plan , " song early hit fogelberg . song quick-paced pop song supported well known players graham nash singing harmony , kenny passarelli bass , russ kunkel drums , joe walsh 12 string guitars . this song patience your life accepting what thrown you when it comes . way song karma , though i suspect fogelberg would say sometimes karma needs little help . second song , " illinois , " noticeable country flavor . al perkins makes guest appearance pedal steel guitar passarelli , kunkel walsh . this relatively simple well-executed song simple theme , longing state illinois , which also dan fogelberg home state . " changing horses " short little country-flavored ditty making changes your life before you give things chance . this euphemistic song could readily significant others , your career or any number relatively significant issues . don henley plays drums provides harmony this song . " better changes " continues country flavor warning someone their lifestyle they headed trouble if they keep going way they . title track thoughtfully deep melancholy song which dan fogelberg so well . though title " souvenirs , " there references physical souvenirs , song alludes souvenirs couple different ways . one approach souvenirs positive mental imagery remains you you get older . mental baggage you retain you go through life . this song includes string quartet , accordion arp bass , played joe walsh . " long way " reminds me lot justin hayward his melancholy best . this song theme similar " old lang syne , " which approaches this theme much more directly . this well-constructed pop song gives fogelberg opportunity show how well he hold note . next song clever song blinded love , this case it sounds though blinding intentional . " raven flies " pushing toward rock edge pop , pair lead guitars bass helping speed song . this song one better songs this cd . " song half mountain " one man effort , dan fogelberg playing all instruments singing all vocals . this heartfelt song observation nature , includes credit moog synthesizer , which used accent which i initially mistook organ . next song bluegrass . " morning sky " pending breakup couple , different approaches two dealing event . bluegrass flavor enhanced carl perkins excellent banjo pickin ' . this song relatively fast-paced contradicts somewhat relatively serious topic lyrics . next song flavored blues deals man caught up stories someone telling him liaison never happened . " ( someone ) telling you stories " pop elements touch country flavor , perhaps influenced don henley glenn frey backing vocals . last song this cd masterpiece . " there place world gambler " features outstanding harmonies zither , moog synthesizer , piano , saxophone , drums variety guitars deeply layered song . lyrics depths within us , allowing which within released . however , it multi-tracked orchestrated sound catchy pop hooks make this song one dan fogelberg best , best this cd . dan fogelberg incredible ability songwriter singer . this album he joined several members eagles veterans including graham nash , russ kunkel kenny passarelli . amazingly , horsepower provided numerous guest performers used appropriately sparingly , music remains effective powerful rather than bombastic over-produced . such simplicity makes great albums , but not necessarily great singles . it albums such these explains why i rarely listen top 40 radio . greatness not necessarily established popular vote .	1
okay , i admit it , we huge todd snider fans . he worldly insight , incredible talent , awesome , yes i said it , awesome stage presence , great love his fans/friends . what not like ? however , doesn't mean this record isn't up his usual appeal . we anxiously awaited this release delighted when it finally arrived	1
i bought this recording based upon amazon review very misleading . there none zimmer magic . i've since read almost all score actually penned gregson-williams . . . , i believe it	-1
i'm not sure i say more . it awesome . peace train superb , others .....	1
could little better - filler still rules here . but it " crash burn " , " all over town " , " future tense " , " sign gypsy queen " , " just you me " - all great songs . i would give it 5- if it not obvious reason this album too unimaginatively almost one same style not mention style point beaten death dozens other bands . still , great record one most undeservingly underrated unfortunately relatively unknown hard rock bands america . " just you me " played everywhere 1981 but band couldn't capitalize faded into status soon after when they released rather disappointing power play . too bad ..	1
few albums get it all right . this one them . i loved it first time i heard it . it simply brilliant work anyone would foolish ignore	1
tras la decepci�n que supuso el �ltimo disco de sylvian ( el mediocre " dead bees cake " ) su pen�ltimo trabajo " blemish " result� ser algo as� como la ant�tesis de aqu�l . mientras que el primero se gest� lo largo de muchos a�os , �ste se grab� en unas pocas semanas . si " dead bees cake " era el �ltimo trabajo que sylvian grababa en la multinacional virgin records , " blemish " represent� el debut de la nueva compa��a discogr�fica de david ( samadhi sound ) . si en el anterior disco la n�mina de artistas involucrados era enorme el nivel de producci�n notable , en " blemish " el n�mero de colaboradores se ha reducido la m�nima expresi�n ( apenas son derek bailey el propio david sylvian ) la producci�n es m�s modesta pero muy personal . esto viene demostrar por en�sima vez en la m�sica que la forma importa m�s bien poco si no se tienen buenas ideas que plasmar que la calidad supera la cantidad . tem�ticamente , ambos trabajos no pod�an ser tampoco m�s opuestos ; pues si uno describ�a un estado de �nimo feliz satisfecho , el otro ilustra ( al parecer ) una complicada etapa emocional en la trayectoria vital del artista : su ruptura con ingrid chavez , la mujer con la que tan encari�ado se mostraba en el libreto de " dead bees cake " ( iron�as de la vida ... ) . " blemish " es un �lbum minimalista austero , compuesto mediante una escas�sima instrumentaci�n sin innecesarios efectismos de por medio , sin duda alguna una bocanada de aire fresco en el desesperante panorama musical actual en la cada vez m�s exigua discograf�a de este artista . resulta curioso que un �lbum en apariencia tan sencillo como �ste sea tan dif�cil de describir , me resulta muy complicado hablar de �l comentarlo abiertamente . las canciones parecen ser algo as� como mon�logos interiores acerca de malogradas relaciones familiares , desencuentros , rupturas , etc , todo ello cuestiones los que este artista nos tiene acostumbrados . hay temas , como por ejemplo la inquietante " only daughter " , donde la voz de sylvian se corta abruptamente media frase o reverbera de manera extra�a , como si el protagonista de la canci�n no quisiera afrontar alg�n hecho en particular o deseara escabullirse de ese juez llamado conciencia pasando reflexionar sobre algo diferente , evadi�ndose . la m�sica tambi�n contribuye realzar esa atm�sfera cr�ptica en la que sylvian nos introduce de cabeza ; ayudado en parte por el guitarrista derek bailey ( compositor , junto sylvian , de tres de los temas del disco ) . no cabe duda de que �ste es un trabajo dif�cil de asimilar , no es el t�pico disco que puedas poner de ruido de fondo mientras haces otras cosas pues demanda toda tu atenci�n . seguramente provocar� ( de hecho , ya lo hace ) graves divisiones entre los propios seguidores del ingl�s . algunos considerar�n " blemish " como un �lbum audaz , sincero , honesto muy destacable mientras que otros renegar�n de �l diciendo que es un trabajo herm�tico poco inspirado que oculta sus carencias bajo un envoltorio vanguardista . lo que est� claro es que " blemish " no es para todo el mundo , es improbable que deje indiferente cualquiera que lo escuche . deleitar� unos pocos espantar� la mayor�a , disgustada por la franqueza del artefacto en cuesti�n . como sylvian dijo ya hace a�os : " mi m�sica es como estar solo en una habitaci�n contigo mismo . es introspectiva de una manera tal que hace sentirse algunas personas muy mal gusto . la clase de gente que inmediatamente enciende la televisi�n cuando se encuentra sola no disfruta con mi m�sica , les hace sentirse terriblemente inc�modos " . sin duda alguna estas declaraciones del a�o ' 87 le van como un anillo al dedo " blemish " ; un trabajo sombr�o , et�reo , inaprensible , que sin embargo va haciendo mella en cualquiera que lo escuche atentamente varias veces . atreverse con �l es una experiencia curiosa , es ciertamente como estar en un lugar solas con tus pensamientos . sin menospreciar ning�n momento , sobresale especialmente el tema " fire forest " , un bell�simo colof�n que , en un disco como �ste , se asemeja una especie de rayo redentor ante tanta amargura soledad como destilan los ocho cortes compuestos por sylvian ( todos ellos homog�neos perfectamente combinados ) . `blemish ' es un �lbum peculiar honesto que s�lo unos pocos ( los de t�mpanos m�s inquietos ) llegar�n apreciar en su justa medida . para m� es lo mejor de sylvian en muchos a�os . es mucho nada la vez , una abstracci�n sonora , un estado de �nimo , una sensaci�n , un pensamiento hecho m�sica pero ante todo un �lbum �nico irrepetible . gracias sylvian por variar de nuevo las coordenadas de manera tan acertada por volver lo que siempre se la ha dado mejor : la experimentaci�n al retrato del desenga�o , la inadaptaci�n la melancol�a . " blemish " es uno de esos discos indescriptibles que ya no se hacen . es por ello que resulta imprescindible escucharlo para saber de qu� demonios estoy hablando .	1

i've noticed one or two reviews people who see no humor laughing what they felt mental illness , which some us might termed " delusions talent . " fact , florence foster jenkins well-known figure american musical scene , despite her obvious lack ability performer , her inability recognize any her deficiencies , she deeply loved music , faced numerous challenges her parents her ex-husband her pursuit her dream singer . notes cd nice job providing some history behind ms. jenkins her " career . " her one carnegie hall performance sold out weeks before it happened , surely nobody except ms. jenkins believed it hear fine musical performance . everybody else surely laughing her , but she derived great delight such large audience . she happy , we this day hearty laugh her terrible singing . her accompanist , listed " cosme mcmoon , " fact edwin mcarthur , well-known accompanist many fine singers , including legendary kirsten flagstad . small wonder why he used pseudonym , humorous one , his appearances florence . he best he keeping sync her poor rhythm - often challenge . somehow , florence managed below pitch most time , then overshoot her high notes painful degree . it truly hilarious listen . rendition lyadov " musical snuffbox " - actually piano piece , which somebody apparently fitted some banal words some neutral syllables , particularly grating , but worst all , my taste , rendition " queen night " aria " magic flute . " once she far enough into it you recognize piece , it really hoot ! ms. jenkins recorded output not extensive enough fill cd , so various filler selections provided various cd re-releases this recording . this case , extras work couple obscure amateur singers who made recordings just their own use , rather than making public spectacles themselves . english translations operatic numbers dreadful , singing , but don't expect same kind musical disaster ms. jenkins provided . recording quality " historic " ( rather rough ) , but normal re-issue anything 1940s . it fun , so long you know what you're getting , packaging this release nice also backgrouond information .	1

after one play through it obvious why this her worst selling cd . i admit liking some spears earlier stuff but this cd she abandons her pop styling go more hip hop . sure may appeal new audience but honesty , if you liked other stuff , this ain't . if you not bothering her because you liked hip-hop couldn't bother her pop , there no reason why you would paid attnetion it	-1

when you actually sit listen 2 hours same artist , especially when those two hours include every piece crap artist ever pinched out ? middle ten 43 songs here excellent , edgy , not completely slaving any certain genre . but old stuff just proto-60s psychadelic rock ( if it could get more primitive ) . i congratulate him inventing it , but it just doesn't hold up . there also bunch knock-off dylan here . no good . if you want hear best stuff , i recommend " i think demons , " or if you dough , " evil one , " which good songs .	-1
here i rate each song out 10 . please enjoy . wannabe - 10/10their biggest hit ever ! it very popular ! me , it never gets old . it sassy , bubblegum pop sound irresistable ! say you'll there - 9/10can boring some parts , but it still good . it sounds sort oldies/country/pop ! 2 become 1 - 10/10a song sex , but not crude way all . very sweet , candy , teeneager sounding , but it slow , nice song . love thing - 8/10they should released this ! it really catchy sort techno ! some reason , i think it sounds like macy gray song . very good . last time lover - 10/10this song , perfect every way ! it sexy , catchy , great ! way , i'm glad they didn't release it because would weird . it one those songs makes you glad you bought album . mama - 9.5 /10very touching . very popular mother day song . it would great sing mother day your mom ! ( haha ! ) some might think it boring , so i forced take off half point ...! definitely worth listening , it very long song . who you think you - 7/10sort catchy , very loud sounding . song lots energy ! just not even close best song here . it didn't really deserve any higher than 7 . something kinda funny - 8/10great song . it sort boring , though . you'd listen it 15 times before it gets stuck your head ! naked - 99/10best song this album ! this my topped played song my ipod ! should released it !!!!!!!!!!!!! sexy song , very , very , very catchy . great long car rides ! it very serious sounding , full bass . slow song beginning , but then it speeds up . great . if u can't dance - 6/10every album it weak point , this album ... it this song . i still like this song , but it just song you try like so much , you end up not liking it even more end . they sound like tone-deaf robots beginning . you should listen it , maybe you'll think differently . it kind like dance song , but beat slightly slower than mos t.t hat my review spice girls ' debut album , ' spice'! hope it helped ! ^_	1

cheryl bentyne epitomizes good music her voice simply marvelous . she sings these time-tested standards so beautifully . loved music manhattan transfer eighties , i am not new fan ms. bentyne . she indeed awesome vocalist it solo performer or manhattan transfer , which very well-known their hits my favorites - grammy award winning song " birdland , " " boy new york city , " " shaker song " " embraceable you . " this unique ensemble collected least ten grammy awards add their credentials . this recording testament ms. bentyne one most exquisite vocals jazz scene her singing style simply amazing . she backed up talented jazz musicians namely : corey allen ( piano/organ ) he also album producer/arranger/director , kenny barron ( piano ) , john patitucci ( bass ) , lewis nash ( drums ) , don alas ( percussion ) , david newman ( tenor sax ) , chuck mangione ( flugelhorn-solo ) , mark kibble alvin chea ( background vocals ) . my personal favorites include one greatest songs ever written composed george ira gershwin - " they can't take away me " which features wonderful flugelhorn playing one my favorite jazz artists , chuck mangione , who famous his hit tune " feels so good . " you'll also enjoy listening ray noble beautiful song " very thought you , " which according ms. bentyne her very favorite song this collection . it so remarkable this best female vocal version i've heard so far . her charming interpretation " love me or leave me " gave this song whole new style elegance . " these foolish things " so delightfully sentimental i hit repeat button listen it again again again . ditto " it might well spring , " which latin flavor , kind mambo-ish rhythm it makes it real sheer beauty . i truly adore this version . intro arrangements somewhat similar " shaker song . " . . . my absolute number one choice this collection " girl talk , " song composed penned bobby troup neal hefti . her interpretation arrangement so sublime i just loved chorus . but let me tell you , i guess they love shopping clothes , purses shoes more than engaging " girl talk . " least speaking myself - i just " mind your own business ! " philosophy . " we like chat dresses we wear tonightwe chew fat our tresses neighbor fightinconsequential things men don't really care know become essential things women find so aproposit just dame , we're all sameit just game , we call it " girl talk "" girl talk " . . . we all ' meow ' ups downs all our friendsthe who , how , whywe dish dirt , it never endsthe goddess touch , they love so muchall mortal males beholdand though we joke , we wouldn't trade youfor ton goldso honey stay , don't walk awayjust hear me say after " girl talk , " talk me .
