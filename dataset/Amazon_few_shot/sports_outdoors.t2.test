when i purchased pair these gloves couple years ago , i high hopes . my hands become cold easily , i looking forward wearing gloves would actively help warming them . i admit these gloves respectable normal , unheated gloves . they fairly well insulated provide moderate degree dexterity . however , heating element ineffective . inserting batteries into gloves provided little ( if any ) increase warmth . my fingers remained cold . addition , i recently discovered thin wire connecting heating element battery one gloves become disconnected . these gloves not subjected any harsh abuse , so it disappointing find wire disconnected so easily . if you looking pair heated gloves actually make difference keep your hands ( including your fingers)warm , look elsewhere	1

positive : -size , good surface area -chipping netnegatives : -poor instructions -very hard set up yourself . really takes 2 people , because nothing fits tight , so you try get one side , other side pops out . -nothing locks . plastic caps hold rear poles don't fit tightly . ' male ' sticks go into ' female ' section rear poles not tight , so wind rear pushes it over . i make some modifications this item make it usable . i taped some eyelets bottom rear poles attached ring caribiners . i've tape caps onto top rear poles add some tape ends front pole make it snug	1
if you search keyword ' illuminator led flashlight ' , you'll find this same item offered varies sources wildly different prices . so naturally , you should just go lowest price , right ? not so fast ... i already bought one illuminator flashlight elsewhere ( see my " customer images ' above ) , going order few more gifts . lowest price i found here ' iggfactory handhelditems ' $7.95 . but during checkout , i found out their standard shipping handling fee $8.21 just one item . flashlight itself weights only 7 oz ., but company charges 4 lb . shipping weight . what rip-off ! such inflated shipping cost , you may better off buying this item local drug stores ( such walgreen ) $15 . least there you return item easily if you're not happy it . [ update jan 21 , 2007 ]: please check out my review garrity power lite , where i made comparison betweeen it illuminator . it my opinion garrity better flashlight .	1
this gun horrible . i bought this my friend let me tell you it waste $$$ . first off it 3/4 scale gun so it very small very light , if you drop it it would deffinitly shatter . also cocking system terrible top there lever you pull if pulled wrong spot it snap off then it would useless . when we end up shooting it bbs wentd straight 5 or 10 ft then curve down , so unless you going get within five ft person it useless , even if you get close he wont even jump fps more like 270 not 370 . also clip absolute pain load first you pour all bbs into chamber , then you pull down spring shake it upsidedown fot bbs gome onto front chambet then you release spring put clip gun . after 10-15 shots you take clip out repeat process . granted it holds 180 or so bbs you only shoot 15 time . over all this gun stinks . i bought it when it originaly 100.00 but list price 10.00 so i thought it going decent , but i wrong . spend your money elsewhere !!!!!	-1

first off , let me start saying i really like my summit watch . it large ( some may go so far call it huge ) but it surprisingly lightweight my wrist , quite comfortable wear . those bad eyesight still able see easy-to-read digital readout time , barometric pressure , altitude compass . numbers quite big , so they difficult miss . altitude reading measures increments +/- 1 foot , which good you get . i like . but what i really like highgear watches i haven't seen other brands which offer similar features , visual image face watch telling you what weather conditions or . no kidding , this watch actually show you whether or not it sunny , partly cloudy , or raining . pretty dang nifty if you ask me . barometric pressure reading only small part predicting weather , however after months use , i say my little watch way more accurate than my local tv weatherman . i'd say somewhere around 75% time what my watch says exactly what conditions actually . not bad . it feature i would very much like my suunto casio models similar functions . until then , i'll rely my trusty ( much cheaper ) highgear summit . if you considering making purchase wrist watch offers digital compass , altitude barometer functions , before making specific buy , some homework wherever possible , seek out store where you actually see watches person . able guess size particular model using picture computer possibly mess up your purchase . find best price , pull model out actually try it before you buy . me , highgear summit good purchase -- however if you would rather enjoy these same functions but smaller package , try highgear axis , or possibly more stylish but much more compact ( way more expensive ) suunto observer . either way , doing little homework pay off end . happy hiking i hope this helps you your efforts buy right product . good luck	1

this nice sword $35 ( plus tax ) . when i removed sheath , there some sort goo blade ( probaby so it wouldn't rust ) . this carbon blade , so don't leave it moist closet 1 or 5,376 years(by then rusted blade alone worth fortune ) . just dont get blade wet , ok . you rub moist towel across it get rid rust protector if you're going use it often but pretty much all you clean it without special kit . please dont brandish this sword around like bad actor kung-fu movie . you could realy hurt someone point blade . i think this shipped over seas , so dont challenge your friend violent battle day after you buy this you should fine . blue dragon actualy japanese video game no one bought . i think it based part final fantasy 2 . i don't want bore you video games , so i'll get point . put it display , dont cut your lawn it , dont play ninja it , dont ever ever ever ever ever ever try cut solid object half it ( prefrebly tin ) because cheap blade could fly off tang hurt you ( or prefrebly your neibor ) face . please don't throw blade your neibor either . p.s. i am not neil meislin , i am his son , daniel meislin . if you can't understand my numerous perenthesis , i guess you're not smarter than 5th grader .	1

this machine very well put together , xtremely sturdy . it took friend i two hours put it together , so prepared . while assembly bit trying , end results worth it . 40 year old man , i wanted start working out again . i hadn't worked out since my memphis state days , i didn't want join gym . i 410lb model , it all resistance i'll ever need . i said earlier , motion smooth challenging . while power rods deliver tough resistance , it not challenging free weights . example i bench press 300lbs my x2 , but free weights i only 240lb . big difference , all exercises way too . said , i still find bowflex great homegym i'm getting results i desire . i'm not trying get huge wrestler , but bowflex changing my body adding mass . don't pay attention bowflex commercials , where guys ripped bone . just won't happen bowflex machine , i'm glad they've started showcasing real people real results . average man or woman , this machine deliver . around 100 different exercises variations , you target all your muscles : legs , chest , arms , abs , back , shoulders . i'm very please 10 months i've machine . though its kinda pricey , its worth using my tax refund it . if you thinking homegym , i highly recommend this machine . you should also upgrade least 310lb rods , because leg exercises pretty easy you'll need extra rods . guys , i think you should get 410lb rods because you'll see rapid results . i've gone benching 220 300lb less than year . there cheaper machines , free weights give you much better results . but if you're looking all one machine , last years , then try xtreme2 !	1

this best air horn you buy because , unlike aerosol air horn cans , it never rust nor run out freon . i like this model this type because it smaller membrane diaphragm protected accidental tears grid cover large end . i keep one my 16 ft . runabout boat . i take one me when i'm diving . i would like see manufacturer make one half size especially scuba divers snorklers . my only complaint lanyard came off . so i drilled small hole just below lip small end inserted new lanyard . this product works great ! really loud !!!! it quite durable , but , plastic , it breakable it subject stress cracks ageing sun damage . but if you maintain it washing it occassionally keeping it out sun not knocking it around , it should last long time . if it doesn't-- so what ? $8 or so it cheap enough buy	1
ok , i got suckered reading good reviews net , over hearing trainer gym singing praises lipo6 . so despite i never found weight loss supplement actually worked , i decided i'd give it whirl . i amused previous review which says don't take it if you're already healthy weight ! well ... she then goes mention she very healthy 5'1 " 115 lbs ! but she took it ??? should red flag me . i must only one ( don't see this side effect mentioned elsewhere ) , but this made me total bear live ( ok , not word i really want describe myself , but it pg version ) . i irritable , daily headaches , saw no movement scale whatsoever ! waste money , waste time , waste quiet evenings home ruined my annoyed mood !	-1

i love this little metal bottle . it light-weight , nasty-chemical flavor free , lovely . it quite small ( what you'd expect 20 oz ) , so i'd probably get larger size next time . also , keep mind steel excellent heat conductor ; if you put hot things bottle gets just hot touch everything it soon cools . likewise , thing chilly hands if filled icy water .	1
considering it less than $40 it good buy . blade handle pretty good quality though dimensions blade slightly smaller than game . revolver design nothing like game but all all its good buy . stand nice but you might cut sheath get blade sit properly . it word pakistan very small letters right side blade but you could probably use stone grease make it look like battle damage . if you perfer one greiver blade then buy one but if you dont mind clean blade this ones good choice	1

i don't own this tent , but i owned other eureka tents past . many good tents , seams sewn together thread , but they not " sealed . " sealing means applying sort thick glue coat threads seams so water won't come through . some tents some sort seam sealer applyed factory , they say . i usually apply some my own , too . read instructions ; it tell whether seams or sealed , recommend seam sealer if not . you buy tube most sporting goods stores . ask salesperson advice applying i t.t here sometimes lot seams coated : top cover rainfly , floor , door , etc . - anything exposed outside . especially floor , cause you end up big puddle if it rains enough . sometimes you need reapply sealer after several years . if fabric , itself , starts leak , something like thompson water sealer make it waterproof again . but it also make it stiffer change color slightly . eureka makes good tents . if prepared properly , they don't leak . heck , even cheapo tents don't leak if seams sealed . only way you would get leaks if there holes fabric . then you would need patch them . if you take care tent when handling it , holes rare . but careless use lighters or cigarettes it	1
this may ' outdoorsy ' ubergeek watch . it big , it ugly , but functions make fattest swiss army knife sit corner sobbing jealousy . overall , i like it but there couple things sound better than they . timepiece : outstanding . it hh : mm :ss dd: mmm , course , year setting avoid leap year issues . this should go without saying modern digital watch . stopwatch lap function ( not i ever use lap function , but i'm sure someone interested ) . countdown timer run up 24 hour countdown ( very easy set ) . three daily alarms . special kudos alarms , this one loudest watch alarms i've heard , i've missed too many watch alarms not appreciate this . altimeter : largely eye candy , but kind neat . over four days , my bedroom went 100m above sea level 25 below sea level ( maps , 40m asl ) . not surprising because it driven barometer , i never recalibrated it , but graphic demonstration importance calibrating it when you want/need it . barometer : yup , it barometer . part i like little display shows rising/falling trend , especially this always active ( even normal ' time ' mode ) . thermometer : take watch off get accurate reading sensor too close wrist . compass : easily best ' special ' feature . accurate , precise ( enough orienteering , not surveying ) , easy use . it programmed declination , but knowing me , i'd forget reset it , so i declination hard way . sighting notches small but servicable . spirit level bubble unique among digital watch compasses suunto , greatly enhances accuracy confidence compass . outstanding wrist compass . package : big . really , really big . but controls very easy use seem fairly resistant accidental button pressing ( problem me other watches ) . battery shortish ( 12-18 month ) life , but hatch , so you don't need take it jeweller get it replaced without ruining water resistance . display large characters high contrast back ground , display light just right , readible , even , glare free , but not emergency flashlight . personally , i'm going swap resin band velcro strap , but stock strap isn't bad , just not great . overall , not watch office or suit but very good watch , compass barometer , what you could expect thermometer altimeter . well designed , thought-out , manufactured , but really big	1

heavy bag/speed bag stand good piece equipment . heavy bag part it definitely requires add'l weight ( hint : bags sand much cheaper than amount barbell plates you'll need keep this thing moving - i use 200 pounds bags sand keep it place . i able get these $2.50 piece home depot . also sure you get double end heavy bag too ( i.e. one bottom d-ring ) , otherwise you'll get too much bag swing . try get heavy bag foam liner . some cheaper bags like punching rock , which won't wonders your workout enthusiasm . you also put true double end light bag this portion unit , which nice change pace heavy bag . ( light double end bag small inflatable two bungees holding it chest level reverberates like mad when you hit it . ) it occasionally smack center support , which makes lot noise , but otherwise no ill effects . speed bag platform bit flimsy , especially earlier versions this model where " drum " or rebound board two pieces ( latest versions this model use single piece drum ) . if you become moderately proficient speed bag any amount time you'll outgrow this aspect unit . part problem single vertical pole which speedbag drum attaches flex when you get bag moving really fast , throw off your timing . use smallest size speed bag possible minimize this inertia . lastly , speed bag platform doesn't really adjust high enough people over 6'2 " height , if you're over 6'1 " or so you're going need use small or xtra small speed bag it hang correct height ( i.e. belly bag mouth/chin level ) .	1

xodus 45 degree hyperextension bench nice exercise machine mercantila , looks great , surely cheaper than similar other benches . i assembled entire machine less than 20 minutes . i would given it 5 stars otherwise , but i am not very comfortable bend angle . i would rather preferred 55 65 degrees hyperextension bench , but i guess there non like this market , i searched it internet . anyway , if you looking hyperextention machine , you trust try this machine	1

this very heavy duty , solid piece equipment . i no complaints how it works . it works fabulously , fact . but here some things you should aware before you buy ... one , it takes up quite bit space . not only frame itself , but also amount room necessary invert goes beyond " footprint " frame . so it not something you just tuck corner someplace ; it takes some room operate . two , it very heavy . note shipping weight over 80 pounds . removing table frame ackward difficult say least . you could easily strain your back removing it , which kind goes contrary benefits machine . so don't think you're just going remove table , fold frame store this under bed easily . i mean , it . but time you all , you exhausted may strained back . so plan this thing set up ready go full-time because it just way too much trouble break down storage . again , please understand i very much like this machine , thus five star rating . but these just things might not readily apparent someone shopping online i just wanted make sure you understand what you're getting . if you don't room leave this thing set up all time , it may not what you're looking	1
it great regular wide pushups , not so great close because your wrists still get some angular stress , but minor quibble . product very well made , light but solid , nice rotation very sturdy while use . i hadnt pushups well over year so this my reintroduction them . i felt my core got nice workout , too , especially obliques . i didnt realize it time but using proper form work core quite bit . it harder than normal pushup because you dip down much lower but makes it much more effective you work more muscles . 39.95 , this great investment . consider all home exercise machines thousand dollars more not effective perfect pushups . make no mistake , you still put work sweat get results but so far this exceptional . it took two weeks get mine because demand greater than supply but wait worth it . earlier you order it , sooner you get it .	1

just two road trips this case , carrying 5 pair nordic race skis 5 pair poles . longest skis 207cm , ( wheels recessed into bottom case take out some space , so 5 pair 207 wouldn't fit ) . also length case extended very close it maximum so it starts act like hinge center which unfortunate when your packing light weight nordic racing equipment needs more support . case comes one clevis pin connect two telescoping halves alignment holes doesn't allow second . i stiffened up center drilling adding second pin . our last trip i saw several these cases mine only one got munched airport conveyor belt , two out four corners caved bit but no broken equipment . wheels center handle both worked fine . bottom line : this case great typical alpine equipment . long classic racing skis , i would buy it again but it would nice see it evolve little stiffening up center connection reinforcing corners	1

i've using no-xplode 5 weeks now , it increased my performance gym noticably . mental focus you get this amazing , all i think one word : " gym " . my sister now takes it gym cardio , though that not my cup tea it her choice , i would think it fine use cardio . nitric oxide ( no ) , crucial supplement all bodybuilders/weight lifters ; widens your blood vessels accelerates blood muscles . this extremely good working out , i would also suggest taking protein your pre post workout , maybe even little when you workout . i first blue raspberry flavor after half bottle it very hard drink because taste just seemed gross . most people not like blue raspberry ( i've read lot reviews before purchasing ) . i am now taking fruit punch which my opinion 10x better tastes good . if you very sensitive cns ( central nervous system ) , i would not take this product unless you only took 1/2 - 1 scoop . i am very sensitive anabolics so i limit myself , just careful this it get you " too hyped " if you take too much . if you comfortable cup coffee or two espresso shots then i wouldn't even concerned sensitive cns . downside many people say this product makes you go restroom very badly . well , it usually make me take trip restroom , but it not extreme people say . i actually like it , clean system before i hit gym . it not like ex-lax , if you use restroom it probably within 30 minutes . i would recommend this product anyone who serious weight lifting . i would not suggest giving this anyone under 18 , but that only my opinion - it up you . rival no-xplode sizeon , i've never tried sizeon because i've never dissapointed no-xplode .. no wonder it rated #1 product year :	1

these cards awesome . we use these our poker club they great . every high end club i played uses these cards , good reason . although any brand marked or damaged , you really would work hard deface these . they also washable , so dirt , etc ., comes right off . i play least once week , 6-7 hours , we using same cards two years they seem just fresh when we got them . i tell you if you not used these cards , you might not like way feel ..... first . but then , you love them . you should keep mind there two different sizes . one poker one bridge . bridge cards smaller help you hold them all your hand . if you used poker cards , make sure you get right size , or they feel dwarfed your hand . if you play home game , these cards must . you won't buy set unless someone burns them . long run , you save not replace your decks . also , keep mind this cards glide very easily , so go easy when you start dealing until you get used them . best luck tables .	1

if you looking this light , you probably already familiar technology . basically hid top notch light . power consumption , durability , light output etc . this light made racing mountain bikes off road night . i personally use it commuting over dark snowy bicycle trails through wisconsin winter . i little reluctant part money , but i must say it worth every cent . i also vouch crash resistant mounting design ( long story . ) if you little wealthier than me and/or if you weight queen , you may interested higher end models which pair same light lighter battery technology . smaller battery technology would also better option if you intend helmet mount light . if you night biking only infrequently areas street lights , you probably get away cheap led light which generally make you visible others . but if you need light path your biking regularly , this definitely way go . it much cheaper than getting injured , you get home faster this awesome light your bicycle . one usage hint : i found little grease mount makes it easier pop light off .	1
i am very satisfied this produc t.t hese my first gloves extended finger length , which i find now big plus especially when doing wrist curls . wrist wrap works great me weak wrists . padding very good well , without it interfering normal hand fold . i read some reviews commenting how uncomfortably warm they would get when used ; i personally not felt it ; what i agree taking gloves off not easy . i found pulling fingers out first less difficult way . i actually wanted buy newer model which allows machine wash , but amazon not size stock . these minor details not demerit 5 star rating though	1

i purchased this watch/heart rate monitor month ago since used it pretty often . it pretty neat gadget since it combines watch , calorie counter , heart rate monitor , chronometer . it also light , which makes it nice . i bought it mainly heart rate monitor feature am pretty happy it overall . it reads heart rate fairly accurately ; my only complaint you not moving very fast order get accruate reading . if you running moderate/fast pace treadmill it hard time picking up signal sometimes it displays nothing , sometimes reading unreasonably low ( i.e. 65bpm when i know i 150s or 160s ) . but if you slow down walk where you better control over how you position your fingers over sensors , you most likely get accurate reading . overall i'm happy it use it long time	1

i using bowflex years . i am huge fan . although i rip xtreme2 my review it , i love ultimate . workout good maybe even better than gym . i'm big guy fairly strong . bowflex gives me great workout even challenges me . i honestly think its better workout than gym because this , i go very heavy not worry spotter or dropping weight me . you apply all bodybuilding techniques , including pyramiding , drop sets , rest pause sets , low reps , high reps , heavy duty , etc . additionally , changing weight cables quick easy , making transition one exercise quick , so you keep your heart rate elevated . i put alot mass since getting my new ultimate not too long ago . those who say you can't go heavy or can't get gym-type workout must not doing it righ t.t his equipment , if properly applied , give you kick a_ _ workout	1

i recently decided i wanted retire my current swiss army knife , wenger standard issue ... i thought it would cool move up knife few more functions , but still not too many . centurion regular phillips screwdriver flat awl , unlike standard which just small flat head could handle phillips screws awl without sewing eye . this knife huge ! which my main problem . i wanted knife i could carry my pocket not weigh me down , this knife too large my taste . i would needed sheath carry it i'm not utility-belt type . ( i've already got leatherman super tool , if i wanted weight my belt , i'd just wear it there . ) blade much larger my standard , living up " folding machete " claims , but locking blade locking bottle opener/screwdriver nice features . said , this nice knife . blade sharp , it very light , it felt comfortable hand . i wasn't crazy composite scales , they feel kind cheap compared alox handles my standard , so i don't know how long they would hold up over long period time . this knife more suited residing pack outdoor activities like hunting , fishing , hiking or camping .. but it just too much every day carry item . i've also read some areas blade violates concealed carry laws . conclusion , this great knife , but not really suited my purposes	1
