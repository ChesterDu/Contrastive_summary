i 3 danelectro fab effects pedals . sound i get this overdrive pedal much more than i thought i'd get my starter collection . couple , more expensive effects i purchased , made brand , don't seem any better than danelectro fab . casing heavy duty plastic , not metal so i'm not sure how well it would hold up stage use or someone heavy foot . comment this pedal waste time reviewer , most guitarists already know they need purchase ac adaptor power source . consider it learning experience . once you buy adapter sure pick up multi-plug cable if you want more than one effects pedal . this allows you hook up several more plugs one ac adaptor . i now 5 effects pedals hooked up one energy source . bought mine guitar center so i don't know if amazon carries them . radio waves everywhere travel great distances depending tower they come . i used get woman talking truckers over her cb radio through my stereo . talk friend who electrical engineer or someone electronics store suggestions cut down or eliminate radio interference	1

this wonderful little headphone amp ! finally , i practice/play any time i choose , i don't worry bothering anyone else . unit distortion effect echo effect . i love quality echo effect so much , i actually used it stage few times place my ( much more expensive ) rocktron short timer digital delay . others mentioned , i replaced headset quality ( but not expensive ) sony set . but , this price , it hard believe they include headphone set any kind ! don't listen those who criticize its potential " live " or " one-stage " use . it not meant ! if you use this practice or entertain yourself , without interfering other people room , you going thrilled . i also lay down chord tracks , inexpensive cassette recorder , practice playing lead . if anything happens this little amp , i quickly replace it . i encouraged all my electric guitar students purchase one , i'll giving them gifts friends who play . less than $20.00 , danelectro e-studio 15 , tremendous bargain . features , flexibility , functional design , quality product just outstanding . you just can't go wrong	1
introduction owner manual states it perfectly . rode said when looking good camcorder microphone , they either horrible pieces junk or super expensive professional models so they decided design mic this purpose . this model strikes perfect balance . quality this mic excellent . it very sensitive good directional properties so it rejects noise side quite well . although not meant picking up sound long distances it quite well 20 feet away maybe more . mount attached mic so this only way you use it it made mount standard " shoe " nearly all camcorders . it mono microphone but it stereo miniphone jack plugs camcorder mic jack feeds audio into both channels . after trying several inferior microphones i delighted stumble upon this mic . it good value excellent microphone camcorders	1
