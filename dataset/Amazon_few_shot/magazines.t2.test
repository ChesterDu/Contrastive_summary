this one many magazines float around school library , it most common . maybe because not too many people read it . all it pure celebrity gossip . there really nothing else here . if you like blurry photos lindsay lohan , donald trump , paris hilton , simon cowell , paula abdul like , ( blurry so you can't see zits flaws ) then you should get this . one article mentioned britney spears stomach , how it coming back . she wearing baggy t-shirt . baggy t-shirts common among women wanting hide gut , not flaunt it . this magazine makes it seem like celebrities lose weight like magic ( they don't-not so far i tell ) . if you want read fact nichole richie acquired yet chloe paddington , fact donald trump thinks his wife melania looks hideous now he gotten her knocked up , or you would like see photos victoria beckham looking pissed off , then read this . this magazine full lies well-for instance , one writer claims young people like lindsay lohan get higher car insurance rates accidents they not fault . false ! you only get higher rates if you fault . this magazine nothing more than overpriced tabloid . there nothing value here . half time insider some anonymous friend , half time facts aren't right . avoid this thing all costs , unless course you celebrity worshipper . i've got better things than worship people who too much money their own good . i'll stick more intelligent fare , thankyouverymuch	-1
this definitely inferior rag big trio science monthlies . filled poorly-written articles . i actually went back home depot once get refund this magazine . it indeed worth gas time get refund if you actually pay this magazine . this magazine promotes commercial products , no i'm not talking advertisements , but actual articles themselves . magazine not news magazine , it just one big advertising rag where manufacturers paid get . if you like paying ads , go it	1
subsciber many years mainly due extremely balanced reporting , indepth coverage , etc . then , starting 1-2 years ago , magazine started take " left " tilt .

once thought women health magazine , cosmo taken twisted turn into pointless redundancy . one point , cosmo seemed must-have , water oxygen . more more lately , it seems magazine posing question " how we survive only water oxygen , still sexy while we ? " ocassionally , featured article faces issues things ranging eating disorders politics , but few far . they don't seem realize other side page eating disorder article , woman who wears size 0 still unsatisfied herself , thinking she must conform some " heroin-chic " fad . fun fearless female - articles real women who make real difference - great . it shines spotlight someone who not only beautiful successful , but enough education talent succeed world , without needing man . if magazine featured more these things , maybe it would worth my subscription fee . but tell me when last time you saw cover not featuring phrases " mind-blowing sex " , " how satisfy ( insert breathing life form here ) " , or " barely-there " , which seems refer not just underwear anymore , but everything . this isn't magazine women health anymore . it all how keep your man happy , while still conforming social standards fashion , weight , financial standings . i'm sorry , but " girl budget " can't afford $430 skirt , or uncomfortable shoes uncomfortable price $300+ . cater more real woman ; not one who only cares her relationship status , pant size , bank account	1

my only gripe this magazine pictures like those you would find gq magazine : they hire models show you driving nail or shoveling dirt new patio . these people use only brand new tools ( brand name label showing course ) perfect-world dust free environment . pictures make it look like it sears catalogue . aside , articles great making it one best magazines do-it-yourselfer . i saved more money tips this magazine than any other magazine i subscribe . most articles any semi-skilled craftsman access decent set tools , making it approachable magazine diy'er . i highly recedommend this magazine conjunction fine homebuilding magazine . magazine you find pictures real people operating used tools real environment . articles handyman bit more down-to-earth , but together you get most benefit	1
... while , yes , i've made comments past how oprah changed little , this publication . i'm sure person who wrote " this just magazine full things one can't afford " reads fashion or celebrity magazines full many things she can't afford . advertising generates money , while i don't like ads either , they everywhere because advertising works . if you don't want see them , don't buy magazines , watch tv or go anywhere . far layouts " too full clutter " ... everyone their own style . there some people who like look don't prefer pared-down , zen look . magazines not reality . if they , they wouldn't plastered plastic , bronzed 6 ' females who weigh 100 lbs . i'm originally middle america , nobody looks like there . just take magazines ads what they . save your money , like i , things you just . if you don't perserverence , then stick target walmart circulars . knock-offs never far behind .	1

okay , it not one fancy , traditional mags but i found loads things generated ideas . sections showing design elements carried through house my favorites . it may advertising end spectrum some regards , but i liked seeing similar ( but different ) approaches same design goal various manufacturers . all web addresses made it easy me follow-up designs i liked , i didn't worry editors trying curry favor their advertisers pontificating merits one item over . i'm visual learner this fit bill . unlike reviewer who would suggest this due my gender , i think people respond differently same presentation material . don't write this off because it not marquee magazine -- try it first . you might just like it . way , i read like magazines books no pictures , too	1

this might sound strange first , but i confess : course i subscribe gramophone its critically perceptive unfailingly well-written reviews features , but perhaps what i love best this magazine copious informative record-label advertisements ! just leafing through nov . or dec . 2004 edition , i see full-page even two-page spreads showing : * all lastest issues gramophone awards series -- series mid-priced reissues universal ( philips , decca , dg ) recordings won gramophone award . * all latest issues rosette collection , series mid-priced reissues universal recordings awarded rosette penguin guide . * all latest releases hyperion , dg , sony , rca , philips , emi , virgin , naxos , naive , classics pleasure , bis , chandos , cpo , mdg , etc . etc . etc . other words , if you're fairly assiduous collector trying stay abreast all latest recordings , you find gramophone invaluable indeed unsurpassed this respect -- both new releases reissues . ads not only give you catalog numbers release dates ; they also inform you which recordings won which awards garnered accolades which critics . browsing ads gramophone every month * * best way see all new releases -- not even most well-stocked classical-specialist cd shop would carry all these titles . what more , many many desirable classical cds * never * issued domestically north america , so how else you going find out what available europe ? furthermore , every issue contains 4- or 5-page section called " new releases , " which lists very specific product info every cd issued month over 100 record labels (!!) -- that no exaggeration because i actually counted them . new developments i've noticed since gramophone significant makeover nov 2004 issue : gone robert layton ( bbc music magazine ) , apparently traded jeremy nicholas ( bbc music magazine ) -- these new developments , aren't they ? so it no longer true say all three penguin editors write gramophone : layton gone , now only greenfield march . ( i take this opportunity say i still miss baroque critic nonpareil nicholas anderson . his moving gramophone bbc music magazine reason i started reading mag first place . ) finally , way rebutting previous reviews this page : you see above list record labels advertise gramophone , it no longer true ( if indeed it ever ) magazine kowtows " major " labels . fact , gramophone critics recommend many or more recordings such " indie " labels naive , harmonia mundi , hyperion , chandos , mdg , cpo , capriccio , glossa , linn , avie , lso live , telarc , etc . etc . they " major " labels : sony , rca , warner , universal . it certainly * not * true next quality recording more likely emerge mp3 file russia than new release " major " record company -- reason this simple : record labels -- all them , including indies -- today greatest artists under exclusive recording contracts . until likes vengerov , perahia , manze , biondi , minkowski , harnoncourt , jacobs , hundred others free agents making their own recordings , record labels remain relevant -- nay , indispensable -- ever . you won't find vpo , bpo , lahti so , or concertgebouw popping up obscure mp3 file either ! therefore , gramophone " business model " -- earning revenue record-label advertising -- hardly obsolete . quite contrary , moreover gramophone quick embrace " indie " labels such harmonia mundi ( mag " label year " last year ) ventures such lso sfo issuing their own in-house recordings . fact , reviewer below who predicts imminent demise gramophone ( extension all classical mags , including fanfare , diapason , bbc music magazine ) sounds much like gramophone-resenters classicstoday.com, who making same claims quite some time . such resenters their ilk apparently never learned this simple lesson : you cannot build yourself up simply tearing others down . ( attention classicstoday.com: want earn some critical clout ? then learn write , crying out loud ... take hurwitz , example , who routinely exclaims : " this best recording or , period . " period ? this supposed enlighten persuade me ? but pardon me , i rant digress . ) finally , even if we assume sake argument gramophone fanfare offer reader equal amount equally well-written reviews -- i'm really not convinced this true -- but assuming this so , i give nod gramophone all above reasons . fanfare doesn't offer superabundance information copious amount new releases reissues , therefore isn't useful tool staying current * all * new releases . i must admit -- call me superficial if you , but i must admit fanfare lack production values makes it relatively unappealing . fact , based its appearance feel , it reminds me slightly larger-sized version reader digest . i freely admit i love tactile visual qualities gramophone -- large glossy pages photos graphics ads all make very pleasurable perusal . contrast , fanfare seem like underground newsletter . i believe more than one critical perspective good thing , while i would certainly not discourage anyone subscribing fanfare , i still think gramophone obvious first choice	1

you've got take your hat off fangoria . whether their style gory , visceral coverage horror genre appeals you or not you can't deny their success . fact they've doing it 20 years really marvel world magazines , let alone genre magazines . fangoria still tops terms their production values photography although newer mags like rue morgue some imports certainly good . fangoria each month checks very large array reviews both current releases older releases you may missed . since many these films go direct video , chances you probably miss them . besides movies they also cover horror fiction non-fiction , tv even smattering music where appropriate . if there minor complaint fangoria it sometimes they come off bit fannish perhaps not critical movies they should . honestly i've watched movies they've given favorable reviews wondered just what heck they smoking when they watched . other complaint would they devote almost no space classic horror , but that just pet peeve	1

' personal journal ' section , i routinely find articles reshape some aspect my personal ( usually financial ) life habits . sports news heady analytical . example , i write this review we thick american national league championship series . today reportage not tell me who won lost last night why . instead , ' sports ' column called ' base instincts ' explains why so many third base coaches end up managers . short , apart players they most important guy fold . across page , ' numbers ' column called ' praising pitcher parks ' . it asks why temas play pitcher-friendly parks so well october . this moment , i still don't know who won last night . but i know lot more game baseball . best all , you generally avoid pricey subscription if you're willing use frequent flyer miles subscribe . one memorably off-kilter film moment its protagonist emerging his tent declaiming , ' i love smell napalm morning .

( 2 ) " he sponsored legislation help telecommunications companies buy up public airwaves . " ( 3 ) he thinks " we should all `smart cards ' - electronic ids our health history encoded them . " ( 4 ) he " voted every free trade pact come his way senate since cold war .
