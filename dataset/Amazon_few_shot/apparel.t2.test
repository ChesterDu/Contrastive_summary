( definitely not " rugged " suit ! ) i didn't problem too hot , although perhaps because this springtime new england . i wouldn't bother buying this suit unless your commute quite short .	-1
i love these boots so much i bought them every color leather type available ! they very comfortable yet stylish enough wear dresses skirts . i hate pointed toe shoes worried these might prove too narrow , but toe area only gently pointed so they feel fit fine . also , i fairly wide foot typically wear clogs socks , but these again worked well me . leather soft i assume give little over time which just means slightly thicker sock my huge stash . also , there minimal padding so sock helps cushioning . sometimes i unfold flap make boots bit taller . i only wish they version truly came just below knee . i'd buy every color , too	1
