so i bought this movie because some reviews said acting terrible but dancing amazing . well , anyone who thinks salsa dancing this movie amazing , awesome , good , or ok , never actually seen salsa dancing !! i am salsa dancer , this movie horrible !!! i seen amazing dancing , good dancing . this terrible dancing ! there hardly any salsa ! it 80s dancing salsa music ! that it . only time there actually salsa dancing when main character training club owner . other than , it just 80s dancing salsa music . that it . if you want see salsa dancing , i definitely not recommend this movie . if you want see horrible acting , old 80s dancing , then i recommend this movie ... there only one thing i liked this movie . appearances made tito puente celia cruz . great see , but not worth buying movie .... oh , story line ? what it again ???? yeah ... i love movies , good ones bad ones . but this one ??? worst movie i seen so far ... best my knowledge , there aren't actually any movies really good salsa dancing . hopefully , someday , there	-1

i've seen phrase " slice life " used many times describe this movie , which makes me wonder - whose life this slice ? certainly not mine , not most people . anniversary party slice lives group people who extremely vain , self-absorbed , jaded rich beyond most people wildest fits imagination . worse , there isn't much hint filmmakers aware most people , or least most people who fun around , don't act way these characters . good films made hollywood - " mulholland drive " it kind dream world , both sense it hazy ambiguous sense one its characters dreams bigger part it ; " state main , " self-absorption many characters offered our amusement . " anniversary party " presented if most viewers sympathetic characters , but i can't imagine them elicting much sympathy anyone who isn't also bored rich prick . if this truly " slice life " hollywood set , it no wonder so many films produced hollywood so cynical shallow .	-1

i just purchased 2 disc , special edition this movie , here my problem(s ): first off , i don't speak italian , so my only options watch film english dub , or italian dub english subtitles , but here problem ; english dub out sync film , sometimes only slightly so , but other times very noticeable distracting ( i.e. during loud sound effects , such chair knocked over , or someone knocking loudly door ) . so my other option italian bud english subs , but here problem this , english subs missing during scene where peggy reading diary ( 30+ minutes into movie ) . now , i noticed missing subs during first part film , but these where usually during background conversations , or occasionally line would missing someone speech , but could usually figured out , these where only slightly annoying , but missing subs diary entry inexcusable ( also missing other subs well ) this important bit info plot story . also , when you set up audio option , main menu , there no problem , but i found if you use audio button your dvd remote , italian option gives you french soundtrack french gives you italian one . it nothing serious , but it annoyance all same . so , anyone else notice these problems , or i just end up bum disc	1

expecting sexy camp tradition " beyond valley dolls " i really looking forward seeing this film . instead i struggled through this tedious , repetitive , confusing mess film . i respect what director trying create , but end product nearly unwatchable . it starts out so well too ....

" ... but then it quickly dives into psychosexual pseudo-sado-vampire ghost story isn't least bit sexy or interesting . i know this film sizeable cult following . it pretty look ( sometimes when it isn't grainy slow-motion ) but i just couldn't make it through . maybe it worth look , but i personally wish i rented it	-1

i just watched second half guarding tess tbs . it now 11:30 pm , i am writing this review when i should bed 1 half hour ago . nicolas cade old woman movie both turned great performances . story lightly funny first , but didn't really go anywhere . relationship fbi agent ex-first lady strange , though movie tried give their intimacy explanation , it still weird . climax came end , very entertaining , it broke long line fairly boring plot . there much meaning movie ; it tried successfully bring emotions smart first lady widow who dearly wants attention life . i touched movie . thank you . i should go bed now	1
guarding tess wouldn't so much fun if it weren't presence unflappable shirley maclaine former first lady who gets nicolas cage her secret service bodyguard . cage equally effective his role . he hates his assignment he maclaine don't get well all . but when president himself ( voiced director hugh wilson ) insists their pairing , what cage ? other than expected pivotal kidnap plot , there not whole lot goes , but film surprisingly shows what it must like surrender your privacy due your notoriety maclaine attempts find such private moments poignant . solid supporting cast makes it work too , although edward albert character maclaine son rushed over too much bring any significance role . all all , pleasant enjoyable movie	1

this far one very best musicals ever made . kathryn grayson howard keel displays oscar worthy performances lilli fred . sadly , this grayson`s last mgm film she only 1 more(at paramount - vagabond king oreste ) . kiss me kate she shows us depth nuance right target whole picture through . audrey hepburn won year`s oscar roman holiday - but miss grayson should deservedly won i t.t he same goes howard keel . true , he hammy times - but it remarkable performance he gives(mind u - he musical star ) . william wolden`s oscar stalag 17 should gone mr keel . that`s entertainment its sequels payed deservedly homage producer arthur freed his genius selecting delegating crew performers right project uncanny . yet you shouldn`t negletct jack cummings who produced this film , seven brides seven brothers three little words(to name but few ) . it seems me mgm " mgm-look !

it truly pity western died off . they rare far these days . few years back tom selleck sam elliot made few together separate . they all worth seeing . this one tom playing cable , confederate soldier who left war early because he knows it over south lost . it just hasn't declared yet . his family friends thought him dead , reunion seems bit shaky . his wife played suzy amis , tough nails no nonsense frontier woman knows guns well her fathers gunsmithing business . eventually she works things out her husband cable it good thing he her back him since she great gun . even though cable believes war over he finds sympathizers trying enlist his aid confederate cause but he shuns them . when he accused murdering retired union officer he must track down real murderer bring him justice . production values excellent acting , directing , sets , music all top drawer . good dvd quality but no extras . if you enjoy westerns you should find it very entertaining . if you like it sure see " crossfire trail " " conagher "	1

siri amster- olszewski august 24 , 2006 emma , jane austen , one most enjoyable books i read recently . i chose read emma because , read loved pride prejudice same author , i wanted explore her other books well . characters austen stories both intriguing comical her description era which they take place creates clear view society those times i enchanted emma because austen beautifully blends together simple story girl documentation societal behaviors time . it provides insights into life social customs lady living late 18th early 19th centuries . one book principle topics marriage . main character , emma , approves matchmaking marriage , through her , reader gets view into different motives marriage . some people , marriage simply way advance social status ; others , marriage love . emma time , marriages matched according social status . one could not marry below their status . marrying too far above one status could end up disastrously . book tells story emma woodhouse who pretty , wealthy , poised , clever young woman . her mother died when she too young remember or miss her raised mainly her governess , miss taylor . miss taylor behaved like best friend rather than governess due her mild temper love emma . therefore , emma grew up without any firm rules or structure . this freedom caused her think quite highly herself her opinions . it her excessive self-confidence led her often make mistakes creating misfortunes others embarrassment herself . jane austen , style her writing , creates some well-defined character while including other character left more open reader interpretations . example , while emma faults very apparent , i found her innocence charming it created sympathy her character . other examples characters like emma jain fairfax , harriet smith , mr. elton . contrast character mr. knightly , family friend set stone . within first few pages book he established moral role model story . mr. woodhouse , mr. weston , mrs. weston ( former miss taylor ) , frank churchill , miss bates all other characters give off particular feeling , feeling austen intended . these characters all good bad qualities , all which left up interpretation reader . novel written third person , however detached narrator often sees through emma point view . effect not so neutral bystander . i highly recommend emma anyone who enjoys light-hearted , witty book captivates enchants . while reading this book you find yourself captivated pages one jane austen masterpieces .	1

i just received my 2nd copy this video , my vcr ate first one . it great video , parts it little cheesy but it well worth money . there 3 sets 12 reps per exercise , you work shoulders first , starting muscle building exercise , overhead press , then you go front raises , rear delt raises , lateral raises which cory calls toning shaping exercises . she repeats this pattern all muscle groups . then it biceps , first 3 sets normal bicep curls palms out , then 1 arm concentration curls , then hammer curls . you repeat concentration curls 2 more times , but last exercise " tri-set " instead hammer curls , you normal bicep curls bicep curls where you turn you arm top . after biceps she work forearms , forearm curls , wrist curls , reverse wrist curls . i usually skip these insert few chest back exercises which not included this workout . lastly , it triceps , you lying tricep extensions first , then french press , kickbacks last exercise lying close grip bench press which really works your triceps . there also brief warmup cooldown . this workout half hour very thorough muscle groups represented . it move fast pace , reps little fast , which i end up pausing tape often rest or finish set . but really only negative this video . i think cory pleasant instructor , she encouraging , motivating inspiring . i plan using this video twice week addition my other workouts , i am anxious see results . this tape i am sure i get them	1

story gets bit complicated because it deals little bit law issues . real problem most us get kind frightened when we face something unusual our daily lives . i watch movie end twice order understand well how bad guys going punished . i wonder what lawyers , fbi agents mafia members would think when watching this movie . most us don't know much legal issues but still interested thrillers , this movie shows rather believable very fun plot . good guy , mitch mcdeere , wins over evil not only because he smart but also because big deal good luck . mitch so lucky story strains credibility . example , mitch wife gets know all sudden gene hackman character ( who important documents copy ) not going dive mitched though so she saves days showing up distract him . well , good luck tends favor people drive real life . same time movie shows legal procedures made-up real life lawyer john grisham . movie also realistic way bad guys punished . real life white-collar criminals hardly ever go jail , even less killed good guys ; everybody knows this . what not everybody knows these crooks still face problems . movie shows sort legal money problems they get involved into . finally , suspense well organized . moreover piano instrumental music goes really well those scenes . yes , this very compelling movie recommend watching . beware this movie deals some degree conservative vs liberal cultural war . bad guys southern conservatives who want rule other people lives according their own hypocrite standards . meanwhile good guys liberals ne . i wondered how writer john grisham could portray his own southern fellows negative ways . all i guess jg realized what would accepted entertainment industry wrote according it . anyways , this just movie it what it supposed : entertain	1
ikiru opening , i started real doubts film . i heard this kurosawa best , film built up just enough come crashing down . luckily , didn't happen . narrator film reminded me criswell narrations plan 9 outer space . film seemed say too much show too little . then narrator continued during extremely long take our hero mr. watanabe work , something clicked . long duration shot narrator continued breakdown man less wholesome characteristics gave impression he breaking down our lives , narration coming back our own minds , we powerless silence i t.t hat floored me , rest film , i remained awe-stricken this humble yet miserable man . takashi shimura gives one greatest performances i've seen since raging bull . here guy whose really pissed off world , but he smart enough know he only himself blame mediocrity his life dealt . horror his face when he learns his cancer remain me long time . there points which film seems drag , but never without purpose . when he dies , finally given meaning his existence , his coworkers family members recount final days pity , confusion , finally admiration . scene lags , which makes us much more insulted their ignorance	1

this documentary gives brief introduction al-jazeera , which , if you didn't know already , main arab language newschannel . it source which won great deal respect arab world it willingness go where other , stated-owned controlled arab networks won't tread . this sense it more than mere arab cnn it stands out more general landscape arab media . filmmakers here interview al-jazeera personel , well some american journalists , american official which liases al-jazeera centcom , american central command present irak war ( which happens 30 miles al jazeera headquarters ) . it covers timeline just before war , just after bush anounced main millitary operations over . striving neutral , documentary allows you see how al-jazeera see themselves how they conceive their mission world . they very disappointed united states , but adhere strongly its values . also interesting how " arab side " gives them very different perspective western media spite fact they clearly espouse its values , like when they angered pentagon protests their showed images us prisoners , when western media routinely show iraki pows . unexpected insight documentary affords you it lets you see just how incompetent millitary media management . american liaison doesn't speak word arabic spite assigned his goverment most important arab news source , if weren't enough , he barely articulate english clearly doesn't know anything local context history . instance bungled media operations when centcom tells journalists deck cards most wanted iraki officials , but doesn't foresight some give journalists , irritating very people they trying win over . all all it compelling watch which gives you good look into producers news west arab worlds . it gets four stars rather than five because it sometimes amateurish handling flow , which makes it times bit unfocused	1
this movie wonderful follow up first ... anne same charming spirit cast just wonderful they first time . i highly recommend this movie anyone	1
i always find it irritating read analyses military movies obvious civilians who know nothing military , combat specifically marine corps . this one best movies john wayne made one , least , which he should won oscar . stryker character , played wayne , not " martinet " . he plays marine sergeant , combat veteran , way marine sergeant supposed . tough , but fair . he pushes his people , boots ( recruits ) , because he wants help them survive when they hit beach . if they don't survive they no good him no good mission . wayne excellent job portraying tha t.t he surviving flag raisers who movie marines gagnon hayes , navy corpsman bradley ( whose son wrote flags our fathers ) , not , one previewer noted , " three marines " . navy corpsmen proud navy corpsmen respected such marines whom they serve . also , characters not " soldiers " it really irritating when term used describe marines . men this story marines actors play marines , title earned . short , even though actual combat footage spliced into movie action , given time it made , it well . there some romantic lulls , but given period movie made , 40s 50s , this fairly typical . overali , this great movie , even if you civilian . it give fans duke something memorable watch . it may also give critics john wayne new view man solid actor	1
***** i liked this film lot . it entertaining , suspenseful , made me think . it staying me i'm continuing think it . " simple plan " asks question , " what if you found $4.4 million gym bag woods ... would you keep it ... what if you thought there reasonably good chance you'd never get caught ... no one would ever know ? " this what happens central characters . dvd cover advertises , " sometimes good people evil things . " once they make their decision , plan their plan , movie illustrates how consequences happen completely unanticipated . bill paxton plays main character wonderful typical " good " middle-class accountant small rural town . bridget fonda excellent job his wife , who very idealistic moralistic until she realizes scenario not hypothetical --- fact , she decide what , she makes decisions different what i would expected . billy bob thornton predictably great , course , playing rural man ( main character brother ) who never chance town he lives just wants truly life , his own way , what right ; he handicapped , however , his intelligence , his eccentricity , his background . i felt lot sympathy his character , since i'm person more like his brother , it fascinating see how he lived thought ... movie progressed , his middle-class brother gained empathy difficult life he led , too . i didn't think any pacing slow , other reviewers said . i thought starkness pacing fit beautifully movie it gave me chance process what going . one moral decision led , each them made me think " would i ? " " could i ? " it made me see how seductive certain crimes certain circumstances any one us . this quality , very suspenseful , provocative film . i think it would equally enjoyable men women but definitely not children all , themes very heavy mature . there no special features or subtitles . i generally like subtitles , but they not necessary this film hearing people , everyone speaks very clearly . i cannot imagine how anyone would dislike this movie . there some violence , but none it gratuitous . i generally really dislike violence movies , but it worth it experience i took away after watching it . *****	1
this one most boring movies i ever seen . i knew very beginning movie there no way i going able stay awake through whole thing . i right ; i fell asleep fifteen minutes into it . recently , i offered chance watch it again . i thought , " ok , i didn't see whole thing , it might gotten better , so i'll give it chance . " ... bad mistake . this little tale horse race across vast desert nothing hold my interest very long . hidalgo name horse . so what ? that boring this movie . so why 1-star markup ? cause main character played viggo mortensen , aragorn fame smash movie series lord rings- i like viggo . i not , however , like this movie . it kind fitting it should set desert- cause that exactly where this movie should buried , never bore wave audiences again . if you find yourself overworked need nice long nap , watch hidalgo ; you'll out no time	1
don't read this if you haven't seen movie ! it took me more than dozen views start figuring out how everything connected . what bugs ? what stickey stuff his mainfraim ? how his breakdowns paranoia connected his work , what quite white place he ends up ? all weird stuff chaos slipping seams , chaos which he thinks he fighting against ... first . max thread connection great infinite divine , which human beings not wired see . he see it though , glimpses first , then whole thing . it almost kills him . it classic iccarus story , except max survives finds happiness end . i disagree end ' cop out ' or incongruous -- it cumulation every frame film ... it point ! he looks leaves blowing trees , * doesn't * see pattern , can't see pattern , doesn't want see pattern -- , very first time , he smiles . why isn't it perfect ? i would like see more actual math . concepts there , but details aren't . not big deal . " beautiful mind " put lot effort into putting real math into plot , i like . also , some details didn't connect . example , ' name god ' ( 216-letters long ) , 216-digit number his computer spits out before dying , wouldn't necessarily connected . system they explained indicated different numbers integers would represent single letter hebrew . like 42 would letter , 2 would different letter . so , number digits wouldn't really equal number letters ... darren kind painted himself into corner there . he wisely chose not make punch line movie complex number theory proof , i didn't even notice ( much less become annoyed ) this detail until viewing #15 . up until then , every time i saw it something different would finally make sense . thus , five stars . i'm inclined give five stars any movie makes me think longer than credits roll , so this one should get many many more .	1
i found this movie unpredictable , even after reading plot back box . acting good believable . some scenes designed " shock " ; execution these scenes frighteningly effective . i watched this 13 " low resolution screen pair small multimedia speakers low volume , but scene 39 minutes nearly stopped my heart . if i seen this theater , i may not here tell you it . seriously ... if you even think you may heart condition , you would well advised loved-one screen this movie you first . my only criticism , mentioned reviewer , not enough information " them " their motivations wrap my imagination around . most young people safely watch this movie minimal parental input , assuming they old enough know boogie-man doesn't really exist . refreshingly , there no sex , although main actor actress who barely acquainted , spend 2 nights together , one separate rooms , one same bed fully clothed	1
little cerebral little slapstick , all shakespeare . it how shakespeare would written story hamlets friends	1
great movie . i liked this movie because i like way sinatra talks sings . he natural actor always ready ' tough-guy ' quip delivered perfect pace vocal variety . kim novak me fabulous actress . not only she beautiful but she plays part shy hesitant starlet perfectly . songs story great both which i transfered my i-pod listen over over again .	1
i counted ~ 15 factual errors ( aka lies ) during michael moore opening speech . * i stopped shortly after . i'm not going waste my time such obviously factually-wrong fiction . how stupid mr. moore think we ? i * there * watching election unfold , what he reported not what happened . * example : he said fox news pressured nbc , cbs , abc , cnn change their minds , give florida gore , then bush . what load lies . fox news no power over other nets . nbc , cbs , abc , cnn operate independently , reached their decisions independently , without influence fox . * furthermore , other nets not call bush ( moore falsely claimed ) . they labeled florida " undecided " , left it way several days . * also , moore claimed recount showed gore won florida . false . bipartisan committee counted votes few months later , not only bush win , but recount * increased * his lead few hundred several thousand , because conservative communities western florida . ( many other non-biased groups found same result . ) this video reminds me his columbine documentary , where men ties kept changing colors middle their speeches ( it called creative editing ) . moore no ethics . propagandist . far i'm concerned , he no better than kkk member . same mental disorder illogic .	-1
hilarious cube vision movie . mike epps one funniest guys planet cube serious personna make classic goofy guy/straight guy combination . get some popcorn , take few deep breaths , cause you laugh . its gas !!	1
this one greatest musicals all time . songs all became well-loved hits , known music lovers all ages , even today . frank sinatra , shirley maclaine , louis jourdain maurice chevalier got together create magical light love story , fabulous singing some good dance . " i love paris " ballet one classic dances screen , surpassed my opinion only astaire-rogers top hat , final ballet american paris , john travolta saturday night fever patrick swayze dirty dancing . story line wear bit thin , somewhat silly ending cafe ( movies made time sometimes suffered this failing ) , but overall , this still classic . why , oh why , it not dvd ????	1
loser far one my favorite movies . i remember there only 3 other people theater when i saw it , though . i definitly not get attention it deserves . it cute story small town boy who moves big city , he falls independent girl way . movie rather predictible most teen movies , but it really funny cute look college life nyc	1
this one my favourite musicals ( seven brides seven brothers ) . great good natured movie which followed hugely successful broadway show same name . cole porter amusing songs set background stage musical based around shakespeare taming shrew . background ex husband wife ( fred lilli - played kathryn grayson howard keel ) who reliving their own version katherine petruchio they figure out their own failed marriagethis not difficult film watch emotionally , you imagine cole porter not oprah wingrey . however it enormoulsy good natured , i love porter clever lyrics howard keel grayson extremely good their roles , neat supporting cast . there few stretches some songs - i mean how earth could they really imagine ' wunderbar ' would great song shakespearian play set italy ? still it fits it fun watch just how they manage it - teh two gangsters singing , ' brush up your shakespeare ' rhyming heinous coriolanus ! there really no extras this all - if you hoped interview or deleted scenes then forget it , it movie , few picture scenes bit information them , nothing you would want buy this dvd especially . one best musicals , lots fun good watch	1
this film hysterical . it plethora quotable lines great movie watch rainy sunday afternoon . alan alda plays sociopathic borderline dictator dean bannanna republic med school . guttenberg doesnt ... ruin movie . all all , if you like real genius spies like us , this movie keep you floor laughing	1
i love this movie . it came out couple years after i personally some what same experiences . i baby when i 15 my boyfriend i split up short time then got back together we still together 20 years later ( married 17 ) so unlike what ' rochelle o'gorman ' says ( who gave editorial review this movie ) teenage couples staying together sometimes reality . i think it good moral story shows it possible make it stay together even when you get together baby young .	1
thank god this essentially preserved movie version stage hit one my all time favorite broadway actresses gwen verdon . she just lights up screen . bob fosse dances spectacular music ross adler just classic . they just don't make them like this anymore . sheer heaven hell-with devil played incomparable ray walston . if you love musicals , you must add this your collection !	1
i really liked this film . before michael moore became liberal celebrity , he completely obscure magazine writer filmmaker . this film major underground hit time , it still excellent today . you really feel people who lose their jobs , you're infuriated callous indifference roger smith management general motors . i really liked segment where flint tries reinvent itself tourist mecca midwest . it consisted horribly misguided attempt opening up hilton downtown flint , opening up theme park called auto world . it justs smacks desperation stupidity ; it make you laugh grimace same time . instead giving these people really good jobs again , they come up this idiotic scheme , which ended up disaster ( both hilton auto world closed within year ) . moore recent years become " political celebrity " , politics become quite cottage industry america . it not just moore doing it ; right wingers like hannity coulter doing it too . they all got books ; some them got films ; some them radio shows . lot them aren't really interested changing anything , it might interfere their livelihoods . i don't know if moore like or not . but this still potent , darkly funny film real class warfare , dismantling working class america .	1
i think you see this movie second time fully appreciate it . there alot subtlties i didn't pick up until i watched it again years later . all acting fantastic . standout performance actor who played " salesman " hotel . weird-a-rama !!! movie ends up completely freaky surreal , ya got warped mind fully grasp surrealness coen brothers . strange-a-rama .........	1
this film unbelievably good . i dvr'd it free speech tv , i watched parts it again again . every turn you blown away revelations this film , if you , like me , never thought much who controls mainstream media . first time i watched it i kept stop tape just cringe , letting import facts sink . talking heads people you may never encountered , but whom you unlikely forget . write their names down . check into their books . even if you don't buy film look list people it get their books . particularly incisive inquiries into most recent presidential elections . you there , i there , but lewis shows us ugly underside media can't afford let us see . this scary , take-to-the-streets stuff . finally , pappas deserves more well-known documentarian . if you put off michael moore whininess slightly embarassing approach , you may find new friend robert kane pappas .	1
quot ; sourcequot ; excellent documentry ' beat generation ' . it so good i saw it twice theaters . documentry wealth new material long familiar classic footage . my personal favorite writer jack kerouac came out beat generation it fantastic see him learn more him . documentry always explores other key figures like : ginsberg , burroghs , cassidy among others . three actors recite famous works kerouac , ginsberg burroghs . johnny depp dennis hopper fair jobs working material kerouac burroghs but chuck workman slaughters ginsberg poem quot ; howlquot ; . only fault this documentry previous it end . check quot ; sourcequot ; out	1

i wasnt even born yet when this film came out but it great . great sense good actors(jim brown , burt reynolds fernando lamas ) , good performance , good sountrack once more action-western , what could better ?...... not until last year 2003 i know victor newman(young restless ) fernando lamas right hand man film !!!! what shock !!	1
" raiders lost ark " thrill . i mean suspense just brilliant story packed surprises . this movie not like all . you don't get excitement you " raiders " . what more it scary , i mean almost disturbing . ceremonial scene creepy , candles freaky it looks like this could really happening somewhere dark place . movie deals truly disturbing adult themes such evil , drug addiction , witchcraft , child abuse , torture . " raiders " you knew it just story . however , scare " doom " not so much " jumpy " like " raiders " , it uneasy feeling sticks you soon you enter horrible hell hole . intorduction chinese kid brings lot fun but woman irassible , dr jones not convincing possessed evil indiana . idea children working slaves definitely not funny one . roller coaster rides however really add tone movie , they cool , but few scenes downright fake . example , scene where ceiling spikes comes down so false : it looks like it ' only two meters soon it close them , spielberg lifts it up again give time woman . example , crocodile scene obviously shot different locations because when taken profile it looks like indiana his goons standing little bridge over creek . guru character not interesting one , image this film gives indians more political one rather than mysterious one , i don't like this image . but ,... beginning movie one best action thriller beginnings all time just uhe first aprt up point where trio arrive india , movie deserves watched .	1
i've owned original criterion version seven samurai . it nice owning this fantastic movie , especially since it criterion stamp . when new , 3-disc version came out , i read numerous reviews stating how much improvement it first edition . i am full agreement . i've never written review amazon.com before , but i feel compelled because how impressed i am these dvds . criterion really cleaned up this new version . it blows older version away . it looks like it filmed yesterday . extras really awesome booklet nice informative . this definitive edition this wonderful movie kurosawa masterpiece . well worth money	1

i went into this movie misconception thinking this just typical romantic movie , but i very impressed this film themes portrayed this movie handled great way . this movie you feeling happy joyful scenery just brilliant . you feel like you part characters , you care them throughout whole movie . movie gallops speed we absorbed into great plot brilliant acting all cast involved . ryan gosling brilliant shy quiet noah , rachael mcadams superbly beautiful star movie , allie . i go into movie not expecting much because i thought it typical " boy loves girl " movie which sometimes just too predictable . don't get me wrong , they some good romantic movies pull it off very well , but there simply too many particular genre . best thing this movie depth plot actors playing their characters so well . supporting cast good , james marsden deserves mention managing pull hard role " rich man " well . plus point this movie great script , you not see too many " cliches " which always good sign romance movie . it not matter whether you love romantic movies or hate them , this not just romantic movie it so more than . end movie you feel whole heap emotions . you talking this movie long time . go watch this ! amazing movie which you brimming joy	1
update : whv currently ( finally ! ) preparing special edition dvd this title , but there no word yet which version - heavily truncated r-rated us version , longer , but still incomplete , uk theatrical version , or russell recently surfaced ( amazing ) full length cut . there also no information whether or not whv plans release this correct aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 , or if they going crop it 16x9 call " widescreen . " i tried update this review number times changes haven't appeared - i don't know why . i am guessing amazon takes issue contact url warner i trying post here . go message boards ' devils ' imdb.com url . ' devils ' outstanding film arguably represents very finest work both ken russell oliver reed . unfortunately , it currently dvd limbo . warner vhs grainy , heavily cut very poorly cropped abomination times incomprehensible gives no indication tremendous achievement represented film art direction cinematography . recently completely uncut print this masterpiece surfaced excellent condition . warner executives attended screening . so why there no dvd works ? here story , best i able find out : first all , there no way hell uncut version ' devils ' could get rating mpaa . i seen some " lost " footage , , believe me ; it could never , ever happen - even though this stuff allowed air bbc tv part their " forbidden weekend " film series . so why not release it nc17 ? evidently warner home video not release anything stronger than . ( they not this policy back when they selling " uncut international version " ' dressed kill ' vhs years years - complete crotch shots , throat slashings explicit verbal references trimmed theatrical release us . ) it also seems they won't sublicense their titles - which would allow somebody like criterion handle release . my understanding they only consider outright sale - which i imagine prohibitively expensive . other film i fear suffer these policies nicholas roeg donald cammell ' performance ' - which i also believe might cut , but may easier time getting passed if re-submitted . ( i know it subject studio interference . ) if you care , warner home video moved past consumer outcry - although case cropped versus letterboxed special edition ' willie wonka chocolate factory . ' ' devils , ' virtually no chance getting into blockbuster ( even its rated incarnation ) , likely much tougher sell . if you just can't wait until hell freezes over , there reasonably priced bootleg dvd available - far more complete than this tape , better looking ( not pristine longshot , but big improvement ) , partially letterboxed , some excellent supplementary materials ( bbc ' hell earth ' documentary , containing most censored footage ) . obviously not ideal way see this movie , but it leaves this tape dust .

what great movie . it still believable after all these years even mainframe computer consoles tape reels camera monitors . panscan very well executed hardly noticeable or annoying . print used stood up very well . this movie got me interested programming computers when i first saw it . before there even microsoft , i dreams one day building my very own super computer under mountain somewhere . damn things now fall deep inside your ear canal lodge inside your brain if you're not careful . i wish movie more story it instead just rather quick build-up even quicker ending . but this movie i watch over again again . wow . this isn't just any movie mainframe its keypunch operator . this one real mccoy	1
last few times we've seen words " directed wes craven " anything , it hasn't really anything write home . scream trilogy debacle cursed , it seemed like craven lost his edge . man who brought us terrifying , exploitation films like last house left hills eyes , classic nightmare elm street , may not go throat like he used , but red eye close return form director we'll get while . hottie rachel mcadams stars hotel manager catching red eye flight back home , soon enough she turns tables psychopath ( cillian murphy , more menacing eerie looking than batman begins if you believe ) looking assassinate her father ( brian cox ) . there really nothing we haven't seen before red eye , but under craven guiding hand tension suspense superbly crafted . mcadams murphy quite good well , film short but sweet , clocking under hour half . all all , there may well hope yet craven future films , anyone looking some great suspense should definitely check this out	1
this great action thriller , except scenes robert redford faye dunaway because they defy reality . book " six days condor " james grady way better . film starts out very well . condor slips out back door ( leaves it open ! ) make food run lunch time . when he returns , he finds everybody gunned down inside - his girlfriend too ! boy he angry ! he can't wait find her killer . but wait . . . he wait ! oh yeah . he finds faye dunaway they throw private lust party , while trying stay step ahead his girlfriend killers . finally , his girlfriend killer catches up him . condor thinks he gonner . but wait . . . hitman , named jobair , informs him he hired kill boss instead condor . but he warns condor they get around killing him too . condor somehow contains all his anger revenge towards his girlfriend killer says " you seem understand it all - what would you ? " jobair says " personally i prefer europe " . after chatting like newfound friends , jobair gives back condor pistol . condor doesn't shoot jobair , instead he lets jobair give lift station . dumb scenes like this prevent this otherwise great action thriller making five .	1

first glance this would appear very serious movie . opening 1/2 hour or so reminded me movie body shots , which rather disturbing film . what most intriguing this story it complete farce movie seems change colors like some sort chameleon . what you end up something totally different than what you think you're getting beginning . reese witherspoon stars once again sort-of young girl lost type persona . she seems somewhat typecast this type role many ways her character not so different ones she portrayed twilight freeway . while present film not quite off-the-wall freeway , it still pretty far out left-field . if you're fan reese witherspoon or films fringes twilight zone , this one might you . while there many obvious clues during film what going , i not take them seriously enough figure this plotline out before final revelation . you	1
released 1949-this movie stars toshiro mifune one his earliest roles tokyo cop murakami , who gun stolen which leads his relentless drive recover weapon-which used crime spree . we actually see very little yusa-the man who winds up gun -- i'm not totally convinced use name not coincidental considering japan occupied yu-s-a time . perhaps mifunes attempt retrieve missing gun restore his honor symbolic japans attempt restore it honor after war . then again-i may reading into this it may not any such thing -- however kurosawa himself-in regard problems american spca this movie stated " i never any other moment experienced stronger sense regret over japan losing war " regerdless , other films such " madadayo " " rhapsody august " -kurosawa touched conflict atomic bomb-and not implying he anti-american -- i thnk it possibility yusa could symbolic meaning . theory aside , this excellent movie-which preserved quite well considering it age conditions when it filmed -- when neither mifune or kurosawa major stars japan still recovering war . while mifune my favorite actor--i'm so used him playing samurai -- this role took little getting used -- but his performance quite good-as one would expect ! basically , this story revolves around murakami ( mifune ) who mentored sato ( takashi shimura ) their pursuit missing gun yusa ( isao kimura ) . if nothing else-this film fascinating it historical presentation post war japanany mifune/kurosawa fans should enjoy this movie ! while quite different-a more recent movie same basic premise which very good " missing gun	1

truly incredible work . great concept . director vincenzo natali difinitely one most brilliant directors out there . film intelligent , allegorical , boasts unbelievable perfect ending ( i.e. final shot lone survivor departing cube , aided beautiful piece music ) . incredibly atmospheric intense , unlike most movies these days , it leaves many questions unanswered . my knees felt like jelly when film over , i left staring screen long after credits finished rolling . film one best soundtracks i've ever heard , composer i know nothing ( mark korven ) . there should cd soundtrack ! brilliant , intense film . certainly not everybody , but one thing certain : no matter your disposition film , there no denying you never forget it once you've seen it . one best films ever made my opinion , deserves so much more than it recieves .	1
24-hour party people mocumentary lowest rung ( if best show not enough ) tries many times funny but mostly poor taste . british scene 1980 influential height 2nd brit wave , michael winterbottom could exposed goings-on much better way . my main issue this film it attempts funny hip-britster fashion falls flat constantly since issues occurring very serious . dialogue difficult follow especially since most it meaningless anyway , film never really follows it premise much it should : rise factory . i really enjoy joy division segments , though , even if exploiting ian curtis death slightly poor taste . unless you're fan brit explosion post-punk era , extreme fan , i could not recommend this film . it not even greatly educational music lovers times very difficult get into .	1

this documentary absolutely bone-chilling , really providing powerful honest look into how war waged modern era , demonstrating how american public lied given propaganda modern wars , opposed just giving them unbiased truthful information coverage , giving viewer idea how war become more more imperialism neo-colonialism over time . it also fascinating note original words president eisenhower great farewell address actually " military-industrial-congressional complex , " but he changed it so he wouldn't alienate congress , whom he'd gotten pretty well during his two terms . it also surprise hear such stinging indictment military buildup such strong warning exercise military power justly coming someone who 5-star general , career officer , republican boot . sadly , we haven't heeded his wise parting words us , same way we haven't paid heed president washington farewell address , which he similarly warned us against getting involved foreign entanglements not abusing our military strength or nation great ability good instead evil . i've always thought eisenhower lousy president ( though great general ) , one my all-time least-favorite presidents , but my opinion him raised bit after hearing his farewell address finding out his feelings dangerous road military warfare taking after wwii , well how he against dropping a-bomb japan . however , this film seem bit uneven , compelling indisputable evidence it presents . though it claims trace evolution modern warfare bloated military buildup since wwii ( it shocking how much u.s. spends defence comparison all other nato nations even enemies like china iran ) , how government media successfully used propaganda manipulate public opinion pro-war not question or protest these actions , lot focus seems current iraq war , some time given over vietnam well . awful lot conflicts glossed over or not even delved into , such korea , bosnia , kosova , afghanistan , lebanon , laos , columbia , guatemala , chile . historical perspective film theme conclusion would even stronger more compelling there equal focus these other conflicts instead just brushing them aside favor two most people already heard lot . extras include audio commentary col . lawrence wilkerson director eugene jarecki , trailer , previews other documentaries put out same company , extra scenes , television appearances made mr. jarecki , question answer sessions he held various groups he spoke , extended featurettes telling us more some characters we me t.t his film hardly accused anti-military , since many people interviewed either served or currently serving military . i'm strong pacifist conscientious objector myself , i'm not anti-military either . like people interviewed , i agree we need strong prepared military those times when conflict inevitable , there wars which i absolutely feel morally justified , such wwii civil war , wars it would immoral not fought . military should stay all-volunteer , equal opportunity , so people poor working-class ( many them minorities ) won't so hugely represented favor white people higher socioeconomic brackets , people who historically able get out serving because their family money connections . young people like william solomon who voluntarily go should know ahead time what they're getting into , if they're deployed , know just what they're supposed fighting , instead misled outright lied government . this documentary , spite its unevenness , should required viewing every concerned citizen out there ; maybe then we'll see some change military-industrial-congressional complex	1

this film battle ia drang valley 1965 vietnam . it begins 1954 when french patrol attacked defeated surprise ambush . prophecy future ? one scene wounded french soldier killed .

[ wasn't this adaption civilian model ? ] one scene shows officer wives discussing local conditions laundromat . [ defective washing machines camp symbol failure ? ] one scene recalls custer last battle . custer not know size enemy ; he assumed 2,500 not three times many . later we hear intelligence officer admit they not know size enemy forces . ominous ? mechanized cavalry lands their helicopters , soldiers start shooting . some soldiers run after lone enemy ambushed . battle erupts fierce fighting . two helicopters bring needed ammunition . back states telegrams arrive bad news families . they delivered impersonally ? battle continues rising casualties both sides . air support arrives drop napalm . some lands too far enemy . they expect attack dawn . but tide turned , enemy faces defeat withdraws . end battle shows load journalists arriving take pictures question colonel . after seventh cavalry withdrawn vietnamese reclaim their land . colonel returns his family his land . 1964 general douglas macarthur advised lbj against getting into land war asia . could this film created warning against war middle east ? it subtle anti-war message ? it seems different his earlier film based revolutionary war .	1
robert redford dustin hoffman deliver oscar worthy performances , while jason robards won oscar best supporting actor this moviewhich ( my opinion ) one best " political " films ever made . i'm not even sure if it nominated best picture , but i say ... this movie better than " rocky " ok . movie won four academy awards ; one i mentioned above , best adapted screenplay , best art direction , best sound . it also rated pg , which strange because they use word f**k least 8 times this movie nowadays , two uses get you slapped rating . but movie opens we witness four men breaking into watergate building , which we all know setting democratic national headquarters . police show up catch men act setting up survelliance/bugging place story shows upbob woodward ( redford ) desk . woodward reporter washington post who reports story then begins see oddities it . why would men break into democratic national headquarters ? who sent them ? etc . eventually joining act helping him carl bernstein ( hoffman ) who begin thorough investigation scandal begins turrn up names very high up government eventually even president united states , richard nixon . bernstein woodward worked their a$$es off get this story , through apparent death threats when people wouldn't talk them , they got it all right . robards plays their boss , ben bradlee deserved his oscar . performance really good , although his face almost entirely hidden shadow hal holbrook mysterious deep throat . deep throat one woodward informants who apparently worked high up government seemed know everything watergate cover-up . except he refused just give up information , only hints could never directly quoted or even referred . woodward , this day not given up identity deep throat or even gave vaguest idea who he might've . anyway , movie reporters trying unravel cover-up , this movie incredibly entertaining exciting . it never boring , it never dull ; both hoffman redford play their parts extraordinarily well , which causes us like movie even more . it strange too , movie doesn't end nixon resigning ; but instead ends nixon taking his 2nd oath office . we're given remainder details they're typed up typewriter . i though ending abrupt , but perfect . grade :	1

absolute power not among clint eastwood greatest films , but it much better than usually given credit . dark thriller , directed professionally bleakly only eastwood it , absolute power centers around luther whitney , professional burglar ( eastwood himself , one his best performances last decade ) , who finds himself classic wrong place , wrong time situation - while robbing luxurious mansion , he accidentally witnesses sexual assault murder , subsequent cover-up , involves president united states white house staff . scene very beginning movie probably strongest one it , eastwood making brilliant use cinematography , music ( especially lack ) his trademark heavy contrasted lighting , almost no dialogue all , it remarkably effective scene overshadows much rest film . still , film turns into more standard conspiracy-thriller , it holds its own quite well , mainly due william goldman wonderful script ( his always , this genius who wrote ' princess bride ' , ' marathon man ' , ' misery ' ' butch cassidy sundance kid ' , among others ) most all thanks absolutely fantastic all-star cast ; other than clint himself , who ideal charming , ruthless but honest criminal , fantastic performances also given gene hackman president ed harris detective case . rest excellent cast includes laura linney (' primal fear ' ) luther daughter ; fantastic judy davis (' naked lunch ' , ' barton fink ' ) president sneaky assistant ; scott glenn (' buffalo soldiers ' ) ; dennis haysbert (' far heaven ' ) ; e.g. marshall (' tora ! tora ! tora!'); penny johnson (' 24 ' ) ; richard jenkins (' six feet under ' ) . usually case clint eastwood films , all actors seem hand-picked him directly , rather than participated audition , because each character seems designed specifically actor portraying them . because cast brilliant directing dialogue , absolute power entirely gripping watch , even if story times less than entirely convincing just little fragmented . absolute power tries make its mark three levels - thriller level only one where it completely succeeds , it manages constantly exciting , gripping enticing . it works slightly less well human level , because inter-character relationships rather poorly developed . laura linney character particular underdeveloped , so father-daughter relationship element hardly carries any weight story , neither her relationship ed harris character . there no interaction eastwood character hackman , only relationships worth mentioning ones eastwood harris , which strictly superficial based mutual respect , one hackman marshall , who plays old billionaire who funded hackman rise presidency . third level which film works political commentary ; there it achieves partial success , story often seems contrived ( although , one might note , not contrived we may imagine ) . still , it give you general idea how absolute power corrupts , kind horrors intricate systems democracy might hide ; but it not taken too literally . strongest elements story mystery , clint eastwood character , clearly strongest film ; such it solid enticing thriller lots atmosphere wonderful acting , keep you glued your seat	1

hirohito always something puzzle me . teenager 1980s , i would see this man news wonder why earth he still emperor japan . during his reign , japanese forces committed untold atrocities against chinese all manner other asian peoples , japanese planes attacked pearl harbor treacherous sneak attack , japanese soldiers killed many brave american soldiers , japan forced sign terms unconditional surrender . it made no sense me hirohito still emperor japan , man who never forced pay any real price all war criminal . even japanese people continued revere him , seemingly holding no grudges over destruction american forces bombs brought japanese homeland 1945 . this biography video sheds light hirohito his japan , but it fails deliver its promises . outset , jack perkins tells me this video reexamine hirohito role attack pearl harbor seemingly argue he played larger role than history myth tell us ; frankly , there no explication this issue found here . if nothing else , this documentary shows hirohito exceedingly weak ineffective emperor , man lacking backbone stand up his advisors military leaders japan . he obviously good learner , though , his advisors supposedly taught him young age passive ruler . 1930s , military leaders saw depression dangers reunified china their chance pursue their own aggressive goals . without hirohito knowledge , they attacked manchuria , then attacked chinese heartland ( torturing massacring up two hundred thousand people infamous rape nanking ) . hirohito opposed such actions , we told , horrified atrocities committed his name . he too passive , however , anything stop army aggression . certainly , fact military assassinated six prime ministers during 1930s would make one reticent speak out against them , but emperor supposed lead his country . hirohito , though , backed down his anti-military wishes time time again , eventually acquiescing altogether everything happened : japan abandonment league nations , its militaristic aggression , course attack pearl harbor . it most ironic military played up hirohito supposed divine nature made him rallying cry its own aggressions . this video explains why hirohito stayed throne ( now officially figurehead ) after world war ii . macarthur , well planners washington , thought he would serve stabilizing force chaotic days following war . rather than castigated collaborator , japanese people continued their support emperor , which amazes me . he became symbol japan ' new middle class eventually good ambassador . he never expressed regret japanese atrocities during war , he never paid any price his role events - which he , if nothing else , complicit . these facts never truly forgotten west , however , some world leaders criticized attending hirohito funeral 1989 . this would excellent video it not introductory promise shed new light hirohito role attack pearl harbor ; all we told this point he seemingly nodded acquiescence plan , showing no uneasiness decision . other than this , all we get old tired excuses : he felt powerless stop plans , he feared possibility coup against him . he angry japan attacked before declaring war , though ; , we told , only thing pearl harbor made him angry . this documentary shows hirohito very fortunate man . he spineless leader who not dare command his military rein themselves his wishes ; he witnessed destruction his country allied bombs ; he never faced charges war crimes or lost his throne over carnage carried out his name . despite all this , he retained his seat emperor , enjoyed great popularity among his people , lived easy life 44 years after war . this biographical presentation fine job describing hirohito life , but it leaves many questions - including some it poses beginning - unanswered	1
... just like hollywood just like music industry which , i guess , point . john travolta , playing his character get shorty ( , lesser degree , like his character pulp fiction swordfish ) mr. cool . this time he trying make it big music biz . he discovers new talent ( artist christina milian ) works his way through assortment characters more types cliches than real characters . brand name cast yet no one makes any more than dent personality radar . dialogue seems forced , funnier script than screen most scenes feel posed sterile . most actors appeared bored many celebrities outside their media personae . aside few interesting moments , only one speech toward end made cedric entertainer redeemed film . it like big commercial ( which , i suppose , any hollywood film ) . certain musicians get shameless plugs ( steven tyler aerosmith , included film ) , various movies get shameless plugs ( including , not so disguised fashion , get shorty ) , certain hollywood landmarks ( e.g. mann chinese theater ) plopped into film like tourist video even l.a. lakers staples center get plug . it attempt play irony making film making film or , this case , making musician . so we watch travolta mr. cool navigating landscape music industry give christina milian her sudden instantaneous rise top charts . ending so horribly cheesy i felt if i watching american idol . watchable , but barely . player covered this terrain so much better .	1

surprisingly `hidalgo ' released ' 04 didn't live up studio expectations terms either financial earnings , or audience appeal . only now , two years after its release this fantastic action/adventure film finding dvd adoring audience it so richly deserves . i initially confused this movies unexpected lack acceptance public , however after pondering complexities this failure some time i come following conclusion . it all aragorn fault . yes , that correct , it aragorn fault . here reasons why i believe this true . `hidalgo ' viggo mortensen first film following his co-starring role massive unbelievably successful three film production `the lord rings . ' his long matted hair , scruffy beard moustache those distant , piercing eyes forever imprinted into collective unconscious every moviegoer . shock seeing viggo frank . hopkins , american cowboy funny hat bandana , much shorter cropped hair , clean shaven riding little spotted mustang simply too much ' faithful ' handle . viggo fan base simply wasn't ready give up image king middle-earth yet . unable accept new look , people stayed away theaters thus turning disney expected big drawing card into major strategic error . put it plan simple , `hidalgo ' came out too soon . if you're finally willing move beyond aragorn persona see fast moving , well acted , beautifully shot film inspiring story tell i invite you give `hidalgo ' viewing . viggo perfect half indian , half white man who rides little pinto never gives up omar sharif delivers his best performance since `lawrence arabia ' . he alert , witty absolutely delightful sometimes harsh , sometimes whimsical sheikh riyadh who likes sit his tent read tales american wild west . it obvious he really enjoyed playing this part . also excellent performances zuleikha robinson jazira , adoni maropis sakr whole cast exotic , fascinating characters participating torturous 3,000 mile desert horse race across " ocean fire " . highly recommended	1

update : whv currently ( finally ! ) preparing special edition dvd this title , but there no word yet which version - heavily truncated r-rated us version , longer , but still incomplete , uk theatrical version , or russell recently surfaced ( amazing ) full length cut . there also no information whether or not whv plans release this correct aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 , or if they going crop it 16x9 call " widescreen . " i tried update this review number times changes haven't appeared - i don't know why . i am guessing amazon takes issue contact url warner i trying post here . go message boards ' devils ' imdb.com url . ' devils ' outstanding film arguably represents very finest work both ken russell oliver reed . unfortunately , it currently dvd limbo . warner vhs grainy , heavily cut very poorly cropped abomination times incomprehensible gives no indication tremendous achievement represented film art direction cinematography . recently completely uncut print this masterpiece surfaced excellent condition . warner executives attended screening . so why there no dvd works ? here story , best i able find out : first all , there no way hell uncut version ' devils ' could get rating mpaa . i seen some " lost " footage , , believe me ; it could never , ever happen - even though this stuff allowed air bbc tv part their " forbidden weekend " film series . so why not release it nc17 ? evidently warner home video not release anything stronger than . ( they not this policy back when they selling " uncut international version " ' dressed kill ' vhs years years - complete crotch shots , throat slashings explicit verbal references trimmed theatrical release us . ) it also seems they won't sublicense their titles - which would allow somebody like criterion handle release . my understanding they only consider outright sale - which i imagine prohibitively expensive . other film i fear suffer these policies nicholas roeg donald cammell ' performance ' - which i also believe might cut , but may easier time getting passed if re-submitted . ( i know it subject studio interference . ) if you care , warner home video moved past consumer outcry - although case cropped versus letterboxed special edition ' willie wonka chocolate factory . ' ' devils , ' virtually no chance getting into blockbuster ( even its rated incarnation ) , likely much tougher sell . if you just can't wait until hell freezes over , there reasonably priced bootleg dvd available - far more complete than this tape , better looking ( not pristine longshot , but big improvement ) , partially letterboxed , some excellent supplementary materials ( bbc ' hell earth ' documentary , containing most censored footage ) . obviously not ideal way see this movie , but it leaves this tape dust .

i pleasure this movie . i just graduated highschool . i didn't really know anything . not kent state , not movie making . my eyes opened both . one realize , this docu-drama , not documentary . liberties taken present story . i wasn't kent so i can't say what , if any , liberties taken . however , i tell you looking photos kent state campus gadsden state junior college , two campuses similar . since kent state officials would not let them film there , i think they excellent job recreating campus . also remember , no one ever convicted or even charged anything happened day . no one really knows what happened . this movie based piecing together all eyewitness accounts . scenes which i took part during final bloody confrontation . i tell you what , emotions ran high during filming those scences . we may not kent 10 years earlier , but it sure feel like it . it truly experience lifetime . however , we all walked away alive , unlike those 4 young souls who cut down seemingly random . this movie depicts time our history we should never forget .... never let happen again .	1

my first glimpse errol morris ' work ( thin blue line ) undergraduate history seminar examining role ( subsequent fallacy ) human memory historical discourse . while " thin blue line " examined singular texas murder , morris ' " fog war " larger footprint since it probes extremely sharp cognizant 80+ year old mcnamara his position united states war policy over thirty year span . world war ii vietnam obviously provide lot ground cover documentary , but " larger footprint " morris ' film rests controversial nature mcnamara public mind versus historical record . short , mcnamara bears some responsibility ( perhaps lingering guilt ) his recommendations wwii bombing vietnam policy . vietnam war not his action alone , however ; he part national security apparatus submitting recommendations only man who could act : president united states . accordingly , mcnamara bears partial responsibility but he well aware popular desire his complete contrition . yet , he now bears sole burden these group actions because he face vietnam policy two presidents he one few presidential advisors still alive kennedy/johnson era ( well wwii bombing decisions ) . mcnamara certainly aware his position well fact certain portions american public want criminal confession man . " public pitfall " mind , mcnamara explanations answers morris ' questions appear scheming duplicitous , but those answers simply place decisions policy their proper historical framework . one point film , morris ' essentially asks mcnamara who responsible vietnam decisions mcnamara quickly replies , " president " . audience ( or least , i ) wanted mcnamara answer , " it my decision " - such - may view president response cop-out . however , mcnamara absolutely correct ; decision action rested commander-in-chief his name never robert strange mcnamara . audience perspective , it nothing short compelling watch man justify unpopular actions while dodging undue burden responsibility respecting ( i.e. , not damning ) two presidents he served loved . personally , i relished personal insights morris captured ( or mcnamara permitted himself show ? ) . these poignant glimpses ranged mcnamara tearful story surveying arlington national cemetery kennedy eventual burial plot fleeting family health references confronting mcnamara family during secretary defense years . my favorite insight into mcnamara soul comes during retelling young quaker who set himself fire below mcnamara office mere moments after handing his baby daughter pleading bystander . while story well known , mcnamara pays respect widow subsequent explanation appears kept tabs daughter . i am still not sure what make insight dozens others , but those personal glimpses underlying force film . terms filmmaking , some reviews blasted morris ' technique off camera unmiked , his use glass soundtrack , or his reliance public domain stock footage planes , bombing , or protests . many respects , they right : either you love morris ' methods or they grate you . editing cuts choppy , but it unclear how much dramatic effect or if original interviews went back forth over same material . if you enjoy bombastic michael moore-type figure guiding audience through series contrived events peppered sarcastic puerile rhetoric , then " fog war " may not documentary you worth local rental . other hand , if you enjoyed morris ' earlier " thin blue line " or barbara kopple " harlan county , usa " " american dream " , then you want buy this dvd theatrical release , deleted scenes , mcnamara own rules .	1
this movie gave us brat pack , staple certain 80s cultural set . term brat pack derived article writen journalist out one night most men starring st. elmo fire boozy night partying . since then gals movie well few others who weren't movie ( anthony michael hall , example ) suffered bit ripple effect . here we see all them their prime their peak heart throb success every teenage girl bedroom wall . out all dramedies john hughes movies , this one i liked least . maybe it fact all characters so vain self centered . maybe it fact it all so idealized seeing all them trying adjust their lives after graduating college . it trying next generation " graduate " movie , i didn't relate when my time came . maybe it fact i let down many people didn't network friends similar situations , isolation i felt during first year adjusting outside world left nest academia . i guess i just little more bitter . plus , my life surrounded work little else , i didn't all dramas going they . kind sad , one scene where rob lowe goes back his old frat house they tell him they need someone like him couch their team . it proves you really can't go home again there some clinging past . not mention embarrassing one gal who managed hold onto her virginity so long one attempts releive her it rob lowe finds those enormous granny panties . this caputed more time fashion music than it mindset . it not bad story , but vain self centered antics main characters left me cold .	1

enjoyed lost translation , i thought i might like this one , which seems some sort cult reputation -- why i can't fathom . entire plot self-serving , shallow , unrealistic . i guess it supposed depict horror repressive religious values , while i don't condone those , film lacks clear characters or any motivation . lot people buttoned up parents who don't get it , it doesn't mean they kill themselves -- because they grounded !? since writer-director gerw up hollywood , she may not aware you can't keep your kid home school without very good reason -- social workers what not come after you . so entire premise false . romanticizing mass suicide bunch soft focus young blondes it -- after which they supposedly ascend erotic eternity imaginations their boyish peers -- could actually encourage act . it not caring , not real , not responsible . but i guess wouldn't bother rich , overfunded daughter hollywood genius out make name herself .	-1
i am neither fan nor detractor john wayne , but it true many his movies i trouble finishing -- they just don't capture my interest very well . this movie exception . i find myself watching this one repeatedly . i understand marine corps some misgivings their story told b-movie studio ( republic ) , but i think this film brings studio great credit . wayne nominated best actor this film , restrospect , i think he should won ( jose ferrer won year ) . this movie quite satisfactory subplots , more than passable acting , some nice crisp , intelligent dialog places , some characterizations evoke interest sympathy audience . scene where stryker ( wayne ) visits apartment woman he meets bar particularly edifying . this surprisingly good movie , it wearing well over years . i hate nitpick , but there error or two these pages concerning historical accuracy this film -- which also surprisingly good ; it clear film makers careful they could . landing craft tarawa film lvts ( landing vehicle , tracked ) , this correct first wave . planners assault knew these would important surmount reef , but their numbers limited , so ensuing waves used lcvps which could not cross reef , these troops who slaughtered while wading . also , movie correctly portrays marines training this assault stationed new zealand . furthermore , actual ascent suribachi indeed relatively easy after five or so tortuous days preparation -- but most carnage lay ahead ; battle just getting warmed up . 15% usmc combat fatalities 1776 through gulf war ( 1991 ) occured iwo jima . this movie succeeds very nicely tell important war story without unnecessary violence , some touching love relationships without lewdness . ex-marine , pretty serious student pacific war , i like this movie	1

many say books always far better then movies . i agree this . i read whole entire series ; anne green gables rilla ingleside . i devoured every single one , enjoyed all characters sad when i finished reading them . but i say movie very , very good ! megan follows superb job portraying anne , jonathan crombie so good gilbert . every single actor beautiful job made their personalities come alive . i heard myself say , " they shouldnt made movie book , they ruined everything doing so . " but when i watch anne green gables , i say this differen t.t hey only brought more story different way . anne avonlea continuation story , i loved one just much . i say though , anne green gables continuing story disapointed me very much . they changed plot , characters still what you loved but joy you usually felt when you watched first two isn't felt when you watch this one . it so different book it made me mad . part i like it though , when anne gilbert get married , its bittersweet yet lovely part movie . end when anne finally finds gilbert , its beautiful moment too . so my opinion this : buy anne green gables , anne avonlea , story told beautiful way . but only rent anne green gables continuing story , don't buy it	1

it stars reese witherspoon kiefer sutherland , number other notable actors pitching their notable talents such : dan hedaya , brooke shields , brittany murphy , oh , you can't forget brief , but sincere performance bokeem woodbine . movie ! it uses story structure little red riding hood changes wolf into real man this movie who just so happens also rapist , murderer pedophile . you tell story now become quite adult it telling not kids rating would let you know . title my review ! yes , this artsploitation movie meaning it actually artistic goals it obviously some dirtier ones well , but what makes most film compelling performance reese witherspoon who makes films highs lows poignant even when they're outlandishly warped humorous dark way . there times when film fails its attempts going too much , other times it hits hard accurately . this not perfect , or consistent film , but it entertaining very askewed way . when this film supposed released united states company made it balked putting it theatres thinking it wouldn't find audience , which may true because its outlandishness , however , it wasn't given chance . it very short one or two week run one theatre rushed video . even roger ebert chicago sun-times surprised corporate decision since he felt witherspoon performance this film one breakout performances year . well , you can't keep good woman down she broke through movie continues good work , but i don't she'll able top this movie because roles she taking now based her star power mainstream vehicles . she supporting kids now i don't think she latitude , or time accept these roles far more marginal appeal risky , but i'm glad she made this film strange way i'm glad film didn't make money box office so i could purchase it $5 best buy surprised how good it . if you easily offended person good taste film , don't watch movie , if you're mainstream person seeking out reese films , don't watch it . if you're casual film watcher looking feel good film , don't watch it . if you're person who likes dark humor doesn't mind movie takes big chances its action and/or you like see every single movie movie star see if they always so ... streamlined , than this film you	1

godfather trilogy needs no introduction . godfather , released 1972 based mario puzo novel ( one time bestselling novel all time ) , considered many greatest film all time . it directed co-written young francis ford coppola , who absolutely outstanding job . gordon willis ' unflinching beautiful cinematography superb , while nino rota sweeping score unforgettable . cast magnificent . marlon brando , his signature role wheezy-voiced don vito corleone , marvelous , al pacino his youngest son , michael corleone . michael vowed never get involved family business , but attempted murder his father forces him take action . james caan also excellent ho t-t empered sonny corleone . one most debated questions amongst movie buffs which better - godfather part i or godfather : part ii ? though many say godfather superior , just many argue godfather : part ii best . either way , it equally impressive film that even more epic than its predecessor . 3/5 film follows michael corleone rule don 1958 ; other 2/5 follow young vito corleone ( robert de niro ) arrival new york city early-1900s his uprising mob boss . de niro excellent ; he won best supporting actor oscar his role . pacino performance extraodinary , highlight his career . cinematography , script directing flawless ever , nino rota score even more grandiose than before . godfather : part iii one most controversial films ever made . normal film , it very good ; however , godfather film , it quite weak . film begins 1979 , where aging michael corleone finally ceased his involvement mob enjoying reputation philanthropist . victor mancini ( andy garcia ) , illegitimate son michael deceased brother sonny , comes michael seeking job , soon after mob war ensues , pulling michael back world mafia . film lacks power feeling first two films ; it just doesn't feel like godfather movie . it made money because francis ford coppola zoetrope studios going bankrupt ; it not made because it needed made . film biggest flaws sofia coppola michael daughter ; director , she quite talented , but actress , she not so talented , woefully miscast . i would recommend seeing film if only quell your curiosity , because it truly fantastic ending . godfather godfather : part iii 1-disc sets ; godfather : part ii 2-disc set . each film remastered beautiful anamorphic widescreen excellent dolby digital 5.1 surround sound . they packaged gorgeous , dark thin packaging , each features full-length commentary director coppola . exclusive this set disc bonus material running over three hours , including deleted scenes ( footage tv versions ) , alternate scenes , behind-the-scenes footage , corleone family tree . bonus disc knock socks off godfather fans . if you haven't seen these films - you no clue what you're missing . i would recommend you drop what you're doing go out purchase this set right now . first two films probably best ever made , third good well . reasonably low price this set sells , it offer you can't refuse	1

it hard know where begin this one . movie immaculately filmed one greatest directors all time , given just most perfect presentation i've ever seen dvd . i guess i'll start print : it magnificent , beautiful , golden colors , sharp focus , barely speck dust film . one would expect kurosawa film , composition feast eyes , beautiful formal balances coming most mundane elements shot . ( george lucas very influenced kurosawa many ways , but this sort beautiful , balanced composition one thing he never mastered . ) then there score . most people might not immediately think score when discussing kurosawa film , but i struck here how powerful distinctive it , while same time it never gets way film . then there sets : simple , yet used maximum effect . this not big budget film hollywood standards ( though it most expensive japanese film up time ) , but it feels far more epic than any recent , very expensive star wars " prequels , " which just goes show it takes more make epic than just money . kurosawa reportedly only used something like 200 horsemen , yet you'll think you're seeing far more . then there cast . tatsuya nakadai , lord ichimonji , manages perfectly portray man going man who both frightening his stubbornness sympathetic his pathos same time . not easy job , especially under ton makeup made him look far older than he . three sons , played akira terao , jinpachi nezu especially daisuke ryu ( insightful loyal saburo ) distinctive well-developed . androgynous peter ( first name billed only ) kyoami memorable his flamboyant , almost drag-queen gyrations taunting aging , increasingly senile warlord insights into his predicament . yet standout performance , one i always remember , stunning mieko harada lady kaede . while ran supposedly loose retelling king lear , kaede more lady macbeth than anything else . she two very memorable scenes both involve severed heads . while screenplay riffs lear , it also makes some notable changes . three daughters replaced three sons . this " lear " goes mad not because daughter love but because , apparently , weight wars fought past . young lord very odds image we see beginning film , man wishing make peace his demons . we discover through backstory he killed , kidnapped waged much violence bring together his kingdom , yet now he just wants peace goodwill . i thinking adage what goes around comes around , wondered if hidetora himself ever came this realization . it what he thinking he emerged burning castle after tremendous battle , dazed , wordless ? scene , shot without ambient sound but haunting score ( composed toru takemitsu ) , must go down one greatest moments film , example how cinema used way no other art form . bonus features both bountiful meaningful . first there full-length commentary film scholar stephen prince , though i confess i've not yet listened it . director sidney lumet gives brief appreciation kurosawa ran . he likens film late beethoven quartets or seventh symphony . such comparisons often come off glib or meaningless , but this actually struck chord me . i indeed think comparison ran energies seventh apt , introspection reminds me late quartets , particularly op . 132 . second disc , we a.k. , 75 minute documentary kurosawa life . ( case you've seen recent pbs documentary kurosawa , this one different . ) then comes half hour film making ran , which shows what grueling shoot it must , going every day base mount fuji often working there even night . finally there 35-minute video piece exploring costumes ran , well new video interview tatsuya nakadai ( lord hidetora ) . there also color booklet interviews kurosawa composer takemitsu . short , there enough supplementary materials here keep any fan movie or director happy weeks . many criterion releases defined what dvds , but this title just takes cake . what more could one ask , short summoning kurosawa beyond talk film ? even if you own ran one its other video versions , they all vastly inferior this release . if you've never seen film , or any work akira kurosawa , this probably best place you could start . highly highly recommended	1

" vendetta " interesting movie won't allow you remain indifferent . love or hate it , i'm pretty sure you opinion this polemic film , based comic written alan moore , adapted big screen wachowski brothers , directed james mcteigue . story begins england , but not england we know . mcteigue england eerily similar country orwell tells us " 1984 " . there dictator , chancellor adam sutler ( john hurt ) , chosen free elections , but afterwards decided become absolute ruler , exerting power without any kind restriction . citizens nothing , they relinquished their right participate decide , merely sheep told what what think . their freedom curtailed , but they feel safe . however someone prepared shake their certitude , make them realize things not what they seem . person ( hugo weaving ) , man willing risk everything order turn meek sheep into citizens , wreak havoc enemies destroyed his life long time ago . evey ( natalie portman ) , young woman rescues sutler minions , privileged spectator v plans , first person become fervent follower . path , though , not easy , evey new strenght forged fires prison . this highly controversial movie delves upon difficult subjects , example whether end validates means , power words . all same , " vendetta " makes you think , great actors , original cinematography hectic pace . my point view , this film simply must see . belen alca	1
i went into this dvd low expectations wound up really enjoying it . maybe " enjoy " isn't right word , it intense , it political ( i usually am opposite side hollywood politics)and it jumps around subplot subplot . fact , i dozed off 10 minutes got entirely lost rewind fill blanks . but i found it very plausible . what good movie should do- give plausible thesis play it out . it succeeds here . it makes us think laws unintended consequence . sure , it makes gov't big oil look inherently evil characaturizes them , but usually makes good starting point , since most large organizations usually succumb fear and/or greed anyway . i once heard history professor say " it isn't struggle good vs evil , it always struggle good vs good .... both sides always think they right god their side " ..... watch it , you come out other side thinking .	1
i enjoyed this film many times am gratified see warner home video finally sees fit release it dvd . it part my dvd collection when released . however , i'm going wait briefly before i buy it ... this why . you know , boys town began omaha , nebraska . since then , they've changed their name girls boys town expanded include number facilities many locations . but sadly , two those facilities located louisiana they both damaged or destroyed fury hurricane katrina . currently , organization asking funding help feed clothe children volunteers who now refugees san antonio , texas . but ... since i knew this dvd release , i sent email public relations department girls boys town . i suggested they contact warner see if partnership could arranged . if warner willing donate part proceeds this dvd sale katrina relief organization louisiana facilities , if public made aware this , it might serve spur both pre-orders general sales dvd ... not only benefiting warner dvd retailers like amazon , but also benefiting this worthy organization now desperately need help . i also suggested they tell warner something else . timing this dvd release so close katrina devastation may not " just coincidence .

15 minutes horrifying gritty peek into injustice american legal system also news media . wow , two digs one film , how you resist ? emil slovak , czech national ( played karel rodan ) , his friend oleg razgul , russian national ( played oleg taktarov ) , who met prague , decide travel america , land opportunity . emil wants hunt down his old crime partner , who took all money robbery he jailed , but oleg infatuated american cinema wants filmmaker . immediately upon arriving , oleg steals video camera store they off confront emil old partner get their money back . but while oleg films event , emil discovers his portion money already spent , he kills his friend friend wife . unfortunately , there someone else watching murder . daphne handlova staying her friends , fled apartment after witnessing murders . illegal alien herself , she not want police or killers find her , but leaves her purse behind apartment where emil discovers who she . apartment burned cover bodies , " bohemian barbeque " says oleg , which calls not only successful homicide detective eddie flemming ( robert de niro ) , but fire marshal jordy warsaw ( edward burns ) scene . emil oleg get away , but while emil obsesses finding daphne , oleg obsesses filming their " trip america " , killings all . he believes he making greatest movie ever . they begin watch new york hot exploitive news show called " top story " , anchored shady newsman/reporter robert hawkins ( played expertly kelsey grammer ) . these three men , flemming , warsaw , hawkins , become irresistible targets emil oleg , two eastern-european psychopaths believing controlling taunting these famous men give them recognition they desire . i don't want give away too much plot , but suffice say there brutal murder scene where flemming showcases just how tough cop he , hawkins reveal himself slimiest snake media industry , emil learn enough know insanity set him free even if he caugh t.t here action beginning end this movie , tight somewhat confusing plot times , some great acting both stars supporting cast ( including great character played david alan grier ) . there seediness wretchedness hopelessness , ending makes film come together quite nicely . if you ready little brutal cop action your life , give 15 minutes try . enjoy !	1

{ spoilers }: " if i let you go ... you think you could fly ? " this what i think special quote when i watched theatrical trailer my dvd " good son " it very interesting opposite turn macaulay culkin career " home alone " movies this where he plays murderer named henry . this really worth watching if you've never seen it if you like thrillers . mark evans { elijah wood } goes live his aunt uncle his cousin henry after his mother dies his father goes away business trip . when mark first meets henry , they great friends . their friendship goes too far when henry soon becomes evil mark only one who sees truth his cousin after he kills dog crossbow henry wants mark fun his own way when henry throws his dummy mr. highway onto crowded highway causes pileup , while henry tries kill his sister several times . later , mark keeps trying convince henry mother susan { wendy crewson } henry murderous she doesn't believe him , so mark left confront henry before anything worse happen . i usually don't watch thrillers , but this cool . i thought it worth seeing see macaulay culkin psychotic acting it worth 4 half stars because it starts out little slow , but when henry friendly behavior changes , it worth all rest it worth .	1

movie itself ok , especially freddie bartholomew ' acting . but spencer tracy gave horrible performance . i sure hope he didn't win any awards this . he doesn't even come close portugese accent , or any other kind accent matter . spencer tracy take portugeese accent talk broken english . like they used portray indian old westerns . it comes off more some sort mentally deficient person speaking broken english , such ' manuel no like you . wish you not here ' . it got worst accent history film making . then there lack realism . half time there no one steering ship . real life , someone would helm 24 hours day . this ship , no one steers night . when ship racing back port end movie , distant shots it pounding through heavy 10 foot sea . but when they close actors , deck isn't moving all . they just stand there if ship floating pond . end movie , when spencer tracy character cut half below waist . he not even pain . he survives water least 5 minutes nothing but torso head . this what really spoiled movie . only saving grace freddie batrholomew portrayal harvey	1

i picked up book yardsale without knowing much it , absolutely loved it ! it so smart , funny , heartbreaking , without ever sappy . so , naturally , i curious movie too . i figured because ephron written screenplay too , not much could go wrong . while story line followed book more or less , movie turned out terrible . i could not more disappointed !! first all , jack nicholson completely miscast , because he essentially plays himself ( usual ) , not * interesting * guy mark supposed . he opposite charming , funny , tender , lovable , i.e. somebody character wife ( rachel ) would fall so deeply love trust so completely . you suspect all he cad ; therefore , rachel utter shock his betrayal doesn't make sense . besides , he too old role ! meryl streep annoyingly twitchy , but much better her role rachel . still , she can't carry movie alone , her love scenes nicholson flat ; there no spark there . i wonder how happy ephron movie adaptation her novel , whether she really write all scenes . wedding scene , where rachel doubts marying mark spends what feels like 5 hours room alone agonizing , while wedding guests wait , out place , not mention boring , not mention heavy handed . total dud	1

okay , script not most imaginative i've ever seen , but i like actors ( especially ben best man ) so i friendly this movie most part . i didn't even mind obvious holes plot , such ... why these characters not credit cards or cell phones ? or least , why don't they use them ? oh no , much more plausible ben strip dance gay bar $150 buy car drive nc . i didn't even mind fact whole " we're married my husband doctor . " charade so predictable . oh gee , he pretending doctor he tour bus bunch elderly people . d'ya think someone might heart attack " dr. holmes " might step up ? uh , they're pretending married oh ! surprise there best man maid honor ! d'ya think they're gonna get busted ? what killed it me ridiculous ending . it obviously supposed surprise ( it ) but there seemed no other reason it than pull fast one audience . i felt cheated . i spent entire movie getting emotionally involved relationship sarah ben , i really cared how they would handle things fiance sarah little boy all . i cheerfully became disengaged relationship ben bridget , i totally believed neither one them ready get married or right each other . film spent inordinate amount time showing me they're not right each other this wedding not meant happen . right up last moment , we think he breaking it off bridget . instead , what heck let just go ahead get married after all . huh ? he left sarah sitting out there waiting him hurricane !!! after making her promise she would still there when he got back . this man obviously doesn't clue what he wants life , i'm expected believe they lived happily ever after ? not only , but what it teach us taking this commitment seriously ? it teaches us if our instinct telling us " don't it ! " our genitals yearning someone else even mother nature seems working hard prevent this marriage , aw heck go ahead it anyway . it just marriage . it romantic ! you could get lucky live happily ever after!it my experience , when things aren't feeling just right you approach wedding , turn run . last thing you should close your eyes , grab your balls take leap	-1
" logan run " great nostalgic 1970s science fiction . 70s great era sci-fi , where future viewed optimism , awe wonder , unlike digital-age , cookie-cutter sci-fi we get today , offers nothing but gloom doom . i just little kid when " logan run " first released , but i remember blown away it premise -- futuristic society young people living inside futuristic domed-city , where you're not allowed live past age 30 . there really no where runners ( those who refuse end their lives 30 voluntarily ) go elude sandmen ( city police ) , outside domed-city post-apocalyptic , laid ruins earth outside-somewhere near old city washington . .. michael york plays logan 5 , one sandmen who turns out more heart than city would probably prefer . richard jordan ( francis 7 ) his fellow sandman/friend who fiercely loyal city status quo , begins doubts logan loyalty this status quo after he finds logan hanging around nursery . reason all this you'll find out when you watch movie . i actually wish they shown more domed-city than they . it really cool-looking structure , fascinating sci-fi concept . but you see exterior aerial visual-effects shots city movie opening , then few glimpses afterward , but after opening shots , movie quickly gets story surrounding characters , lot scenes take place sets scenes location . like redressed shopping malls , because indoor malls new 70 , people still fascinated these indoor shopping arenas , so it made sense redress one these new malls represent interior futuristic city . but miniatures built exterior aerial shots domed-city really cool look . some people , probably younger people who grew up this cgi age , ridicule film city looking fake like model . yeah , if you squint , you makes out few imperfections , but so what ? minatures look spectacular their time . but all dated aspects this film what makes it all more interesting . imperfection more interesting than perfection anyway . but " logan run " one last sci-fi epics . those stand-alone films like grand mgm stamp them . everything today so cookie-cutter bland , production companies you've never heard putting out direc t-t o-dvd caliber movies faster than bic corporation putting out pens . it just not same anymore . but definately purchase " logan run " dvd . it even better viewing it widescreen , it shown theaters	1
you'll need them , because you're going laugh hard you cry . i loved books girl , i adore this movie , sequel well . while no book movie ever folloiw one exactly , it keeps so strongly story i almost go back figure out which details they left out . megan follows terrific job anne , it great acting challenge well , anne grows age 12 16-17 this movie , megan follows 15 or 16 , i believe . yet her ability carried her through very believable 12 year old . rest casting inspired . characters looked acted almost exactly like i always imagined them . anne human . she gets mad , she gets hurt , she acts or speaks before she thinks , this makes her believable any child , or any one us who ever something like . welll worth owning , showing anyone who'll watch .	1

film based short stephen king story teacher who returns his old home town take up job . problem , there too much history there bad memories . his brother killed hoodlums way back when they younger , hoodlums then hit train same day . now hoodlums returned finish off brother . sounds ridiculous but it works . everybody see these guys but nobody believes teacher when he tries convince them they very evil . it very eeery feeling it , remains one my favs early 90 . dvd - released twice dvd both average print quality . looks more like video quality . first dvd edition just film , while second dvd release includes dreadful sequel which nothing original ( look young hilary swank it ) . ignore sequel , enjoy first installment instead	1
while boasting excellent cast intriguing plot , this film simply tanks . ashley judd plays role black widow , female serial killer , who systematically kills off every man she meets . ewan mcgregor british intelligence officer who hot her trail . some incomprehensible , mumbo jumbo reason , he ends up protective her . fact , incomprehensible good way describe this entire film . it poorly edited shuffles snail pace . despite excellent cast , action plods movie dead before first body hits ground . one finds oneself little sympathy or empathy any characters this cinematic fiasco . not waste you time or your money . this one turkey	-1

this film so stupid when different locations quebec shown captions read " st. jovite , canada " or montreal , canada " like mentioning quebec would too complicated retarded masses this film intended . angelina jolie plays her smug little self pitiful dialogue usual lately . but i say i am happy she went see expos game while montreal ... she shows us some skin here . kid begining film who plays killer so annoying !!! someone needs steal his john lennon glasses kick his ass before he ruins yet film . one bonus here marie-jose croze it albeit briefly . she should lead . she hotter than angelina better actress ( see munich ) . this film also beneath jean-hugues anglade who plays detective act circles aroun ethan hawke any day week	1

i think it kind poetic i ended up getting film adaption ray bradbury " fahrenheit 451 " . it because i couldn't find book anywhere ! i don't know how good it adaption , but i found film thought provoking , well directed clever . film set world where books banned burnt . nothing read , except numbers top bottles pills sedatives people this age often take . books contradicting ideas , book burning " firemen " claim . they make people unhappy sometimes , they change people . authors raised high world literature , if they more than people around them . happier society , where everyone equal , books must destroyed , they say . montag fireman , talented one due promotion . he wife , he large television set wall ( though most people this world two ) , he considers himself pretty happy guy . young woman approaches him monorail home , seen him around so long trip home she felt she should say hello . she asks his job , wonders if he ever read any books he burnt . it gets him thinking , he ends up reading copy david copperfield charles dickens due torched . like firemen say , it changes his life , suddenly this happy society seems little more sinister than before ... i think it film flows really well , couple nice directorial quirks , british 1960s feel it sets , landscapes colour schemes , which i always like . it kind strange it english film , since ray bradbury , author book american . ah well . there lot ideas toyed here , nature memory , knowledge , oral traditions , control . lot think . definitely worth look sci-fi fans , i think	1

femme fatale probably de palma most controversial film . it truly love-it or hate-it film . critics almost totally split film . lot thought it total piece trash , others thought it masterpiece neo-noir filmmaking . heck , this movie even somewhat split de palma most loyal fans down middle . one thing sure : femme fatale proved me once all brian de palma one most fearless talented directors hollywood ever seen or ever see . film opening definitely strongest point . it opens 20-minute diamond heist cannes film festival france . this sequence low dialogue high style . de palma amazing job keeping viewer absolute attention every detail ( even though we still get some surprises end ) . rebecca romijn-stamos plays one thiefs , laure ash . heist goes wrong ( don't they always ? ) laure gets away diamonds . thanks convenient case mistaken identity , laure able switch identities french woman , but not before spying paparazzo ( antonio banderas ) takes her picture his balcony . film then jumps ahead seven years , laure back paris , but this time completely different person , wife american ambassador france . trouble , photog still there , too . once photo laure released , demons her past come forefront , movie takes us its twisting , downhill track crazy , mind-blowing final 20 minutes either make you flip off tv or scream , " i love brian de palma ! " me , it latter . i think this film absolutely de palma most daring film , one his most interesting screenplays . all de palma , you either love or hate this movie , but one this sure : it definitely evoke reaction all its viewers , de palma one few guys who relied these days	1
this film truly epic experience , type film one doesn't see too much anymore these days . based autobiographical novel stefanie zweig , it concerns redlich family , one lucky few families leave nazi germany before it too late . walter , father , saw writing wall left kenya 1937 , sending his wife jettel daughter regina six months later , 1938 . normally one doesn't think refugees nazis escaping anyplace africa , particularly not kenya , although there actually fairly substantial jewish community nairobi time wwii broke out , other refugees , such redlichs , living more isolated less-developed areas nation . jettel bit jewish german princess beginning film , very hard time adjusting life kenya . she believes living farm rongai temporary , so unaware reality waiting her she brought her fine china bought evening gown instead something more practical like refrigerator before she left home . her character proves most interesting , one who goes through most development , becoming very different person end film . walter , contrast , sea change attitude opposite direction , wants return germany after war instead staying kenya , which become like home his family saved their lives . they also deal their troubled marriage ; they'd apparently begun some problems before they left germany , but their marriage really put test kenya , particularly while walter away british army four years jettel left tend farm . young regina also fascinating character ; so young , she adjusts quickly life kenya , although , like her parents , doesn't ever really fully come think it home . she number different cultures deal -- german culture she left behind one she connection via her parents , native kenyan culture swahili language , british culture colonial school she attends . ( though most this film shows us kenya through eyes people living far away so-called civilisation , this still time when most africa under colonial rule , much different africa than it today . ) her relationship owuor , native who acts servant her family , incredibly moving touching , one finest aspects this film . unlike her mother , she never any hesitation or resistance befriending natives . she doesn't care their skin dark hers light ; they're just other children she fun who like her , same way she instantly takes owuor , seeing him kind man who warmly welcomes her kenya . surface this historical film , but true themes nature home , alienation , self-discovery , finding oneself , loss , how sometimes least likely place become refuge come feel almost like home over time . what meaning word home , refugee or immigrant ever really completely feel home foreign land , these people ever really feel home anywhere again , whether they remain kenya , return germany , or start new life entirely new place ? it also nice change pace see wwii-era film set africa , see how war affected native peoples , dominating british colonialists , refugees like redlichs . soundtrack also incredibly gorgeous , natural scenery . there also wealth bonus features . audio commentary top-notch , revealing such interesting facts how walter voice actually popular actor herbert knaup but two undubbed scenes ( one which conducted entirely english ) , because it felt merab ninidze , true actor , too strong georgian accent , silas kereti , who plays regina friend jogona young adult , initially very hesitant performing one tribal ceremonies film because it tribe , he thought taking part would mean he becoming member this other tribe . other extras deleted scenes ( optional commentary ); making-of featurette ; interviews merab ninidze , juliane k�hler ( jettel ) , matthias habich ( walter s�sskind , character who immigrated kenya before redlichs ) , sidide onyulu ( owuor ) , caroline link ( director ) , peter herrmann ( producer ) , stefanie zweig ; score selections ; storyboard comparison locust scene ; trailers ; photo montage commentary . almost two half hours long ( three hours long originally ) , this truly epic picture , real emotional powerhouse . all characters developed so well acted so masterfully one grows feel though one actually knows them , gone this powerful life-changing journey them . it also not " just wwii movie , " since setting themes so very different usual ones . far just movie , this one makes viewer think feel instead just entertaining or delivering lot high-tech special effects . it shame more films hollywood aren't masterfully crafted this wonderful highly-recommended german film	1

i loved this movie watch it whenever it tv . i refuse buy copy because somehow makes it less special than just happening it while channel surfing . i not particularly like dustin hoffman - he great actor but he just never quite it me . but i love him tootsie . actually , i differentiate tootsie michael dorsey . michael dorsey hoffman okay ; toosie he superlative . i make distinction because this only cross-dressing film where i totally buy into reality character . role tootsie part lifetime -and hoffman outstanding it . he us laughing , crying , cheering , even producing outrage . we sympathize his rejection jessica lange ( she not lesbian ) wait anxiously bill murray " you [ ... ] " response tootsie almost rape her plummy co-star soap opera . every actor this film perfect - cameos sydney pollack ( director ) michael dorsey agent terri garr confused desperate actress/girlfriend bill murray slightly spacy roommate . there dabney coleman charles durning jessica lange . best all - dustin hoffman tootsie , maybe even more than he michael dorsey .	1

book amazing ; this movie adaptation quite poor . although actress who plays o quite beautiful , there some fairly erotic scenes , this movie deeply flawed , i can't recommend it . plotline gets totally garbled , especially toward end , point where it runs entirely contrary book intention several key philosophical psychological points . second , actor who plays stephen absolutely one worst casting choices i've ever seen ; doesn't fit role one bit . so please , read book . if you've already read book love it , it probably worth your while eventually see this film , but expect disappointed .	1

this classic flick every way ! it some not so great acting , little cheesyness here there , but all all it several scary moments . funniest thing me , tho , opening , zombie attacks then chases barbara moving pretty quickly , then when it shows him arrive house later , he slowly turns look other zombies , then he starts swaying moving really slowly stiffly ! it like he probably thought , " oh yea , i'm zombie , i guess i better stiffen up ! " try notice next time you watch this classic . i bet when this came out 1968 , it considered horrible shocking !	1

first i want make it very clear , while film it frightening moments this not horror movie any means if that what your looking then you should look elsewhere . said , storywise , plotwise actingwise , this hands down best supernatural film you ever see . placed capable hands writer/directer . night shayamalan who proved he force reckond well very capable hands actors bruce willis , toni colleti haley joel osment who well deserved oscar nod this film rises above it predesesors it reaches much more emotions than fear . it reaches your heart you watch this child deal his ' gift ' sorts well dr. crowe ( willis ) he deals distance him his wife . ending shocking they come deffinatly earns itself recognition shyamalans best script ( unbreakable good , village its points but signs complete mess ) i say i always found bruce impressive actor , but i felt he far too undertapped ... this performance prooves he more just na action star needs taken much more seriously ... i would liked him take home oscar nod this . film revolves around cole ( osment ) his ability see dead people . crowe ( willis ) child psyciatris who trying help cole come terms his gifts . it truly touching crowe helps cole find ways make ghost go away . this great film gives new perspective old idea ... other words this one started them all , this reinvention ghost story because major success this film we other gems like ' ring ' ' what lies beneath ' ..	1

it cliche , but most people who saw this movie just didn't get it . movie focuses ( further ) adventures buckaroo banzai , scientist , neurosurgeon , rocker , protector world . he his collection memorable characters around him , hard-rocking scientists adventurers known hong kong cavaliers . action dialogue characters camped up , eveyone good time harkening back serials old modern flavor . pay close attention , or you'll miss some fun movie ( example , droning background mental hospital lithium no longer available credit ) . no apparent reason , john litgow goes into cheesy italian accent free assocation word " home , " finishing beach boys quote : " i feel so broke up , i want go home . " jeff goldblum asks why there watermelon attached big , scary-looking machine . he promised he'll told later but course never . we're left smile wonder . course there classic lines such , " no matter where you go , there you , " perfect tommy coming defense mr. wizard top scientist . you never know when line coming . while performing neurosurgery , banzai says " no , don't tug . you never know what it might attached . " ellen barkin several fine moments perfect female lead . me , social message ( if there one ) came my son , who watched it me said " it really cool smart .

i really don't know where begin . this film nearly perfect you get . every facet great filmmaking flawlessly displayed absolute perfection michelangelo antonioni , l'avventura . this one greatest motion pictures ever made . l'avventura all relationships . relationships main characters also territory they inhabit . needless say , topography plays important role this film thus becomes outside character itself . when viewing first time , pay special attention deliberate pacing film . it very bold lyrical its approach . motion pictures aren't made like this anymore you'll pleasantly surprised there very little intrusion or manipulation director . antonioni really lets this film breathe naturally ; nothing hurried or out place . this really perfect film . i won't talk anymore this landmark motion picture ; it would sacreligious ruin great experience you	1
one best movies i seen !!! subject itself forces you look your own limitations anything out your ' normal ' boundaries . after watching this movie , you better insight how limited most us how this causes lot more harm than we think it . terms film quality , it also one best i seen . actors tremendous , characters so accurately portrayed you actually feel pain each one them . course , ludovic innocence rendered beautifully , but changes mother goes through very emotionally charged ( maybe because i am mother myself ??? ) . she seems first most understanding all when it comes her son differences , then goes through confusion stage , then tries really hard understand him . but when her family whole life setting ( house , husband job , social life ) goes havoc , she closes down emotionally her own son which extremely painful watch . after one final emotionally violent confrontation ludovic , she realizes she loosing him finally sees him way it should : her beautiful child , nothing more , nothing less . it also filmed very colorful manner ( especially during ludovic escapes into dreamland ) , which accentuate notion ludovic innocence . neighborhood setting seems bit caricature american suburbia ( green front lawns , barbecue parties ) european flavor ( adults dancing neighborhood parties ) . any case , movie seems make clear statement intolerance seems most prominent middle-class white surburban populations , which many could find this bit stereotype . any case , i highly recommend this movie anyone who wants something more out movie than what presented mainstream movies .	1
i'm not going try get all characters names right yi yi . there lot characters , extended family various lovers children . taiwan modern , impressive city , place rarely seen american television or film . i might looking manhattan rather than taipei . computer engineer family , wife spiritual emptiness , teen daughter involved her first serious sexual activity , grandmother life support , eight-year old son teased exhaustion little girls , they live high-rise condominium over raised superhighway . then there ner-do-well brother-in-law , so superstitious he marries his pregnant wife only chinese lucky day . his old girlfriend shows up wedding raise hell . she returns babies chinese confirmation more same . fight breaks out , kicking little men screechy women . our engineer walked away young love , while wife monks , he renews relationship business trip tokyo . he love . so she , but , i can't tell you what happens without giving away this poignant part plot . engineer daughter rather unusual fling well . i've left out ton information this film close three hours long , but watch beautiful cinematography edward yang , his brilliant pacing . one thinks it real life .	1

" imagine " warm beautiful celebration john lennon life told his own words words those who loved him supported his mission . his idealism prominent , but so his charismatic personality comedic interchange media . john lennon art expands way beyond his poetic lyrics melodies we find him much more complex man than we may realized before . here he expresses his romantic side sketches we find displayed walls while he yoko luxuriate their newlywed bliss . later they shown way almost portrays more innocent side soul love ( gazing into each other eyes kissing all you truly see ) or love goes back beginning time . it if they remove outer trappings life put each other souls . john then shown embracing his role father balances his responsibilities all while maintaining fascinating powerful presence . john lennon beautiful heart reveals itself most poignantly moment where he explains his lyrics homeless man haunting blue eyes then asks : " you hungry ? " you could feel his concern those around him moments where he connects so deeply souls still searching their purpose . there also beautiful moment where john yoko build little cabin/playhouse out island . they row across walk into house . then camera pulls away , silence scene says more than any narration ever could . fan mania captured very effectively during footage his early days beatles , but true beauty appreciation his music seems evolve quiet sessions recording studio . footage this dvd seems more unique than most also shows concert roof combative conversations media who seemed truly not understand his dream . he spoke hearts those who tired chaos wanted peace world moving towards more kosmocentric awareness . what strikes me most beautiful aspect this deluxe edition uniqueness presentation how well story woven together create warm memory so alive john lennon presence , his music his life purpose .

this , unabashedly , my favorite pirate movie until " pirates carribean " series released . graham chapman so over top title character , rest cast ( save cheech chong ) pretty much who who british comedy scene early eighties . john cleese wonderful pew , peter boyle mr. moon funny well . i heartily recommend this anyone looking quick , brainless laugh	1

this one worst movies i've ever wasted my time watching ! don't dispose precious cent this movie unless you gigantic drew barrymore fan you merely viewing movie raw sex scenes constant , random nudity . storyline could worked , yet movie pathetically low budget , acting horrid movie falls desperately flat . it impossible like this movie unless you obsessively love drew barrymore you want watch her her lowest point . it so bad i come here vent it online . director obviously film school drop-out who offered actors free cocaine produces low budget porn .	-1

you either love movie or you don't . if you're vod lover , special edition 2-disk release worth every cent . film beautifully restored its " color de luxe " panavision widescreen glory . ( my vhs tape barge making its way staten island landfill i type this ) . second disk includes karioke renderings songs several documentaries featurettes ( all listed above ) . my favorite these " jacqueline susann valley dolls , " which generous film clips depicting chain-smoking failed-actress-cum-bestselling-author speaking herself coming across , more than anything , highly committed indefatigable professional writer ( who used different color typing paper each her six drafts manuscript ) . it easy see how this no-nonsense , get-it-done schlockmeister got under skin procratinating perfectionist celebrity syncophant truman capote . ( i surprised see no mention their long-standing public rivalry anywhere among dvd extras . ) missed opportunity among all extras commentary track disk one . it great barbara parkins ( although her memories seem grown rather dim over years ) . one would liked hear patty duke ( or even leigh grant ) well , though we only guess why fox wasn't able make happen . but commentary could greatly enriched if fox nixed use gossip columnist ted cassablanca ( who stole his nom de plume gay character novel ) engaged truly informed movie critic or film historian co-comment ms parkins . casablanca badgers parkins " dish " other actresses , sharon tate murder , judy garland walking out helen lawson role ; when he not badgering , he cooing her perfume or comparing notes her which actors film they each found " do-able . " ( parkins just closed her eyes during her love scenes thought singer cat stevens england . ) both parkins casablanca surprisingly ignorant basic facts film . i found myself frequently shouting tv screen , " watch disk two--it all explained there ! " among things i still don't understand : why so many people dimiss or discount hayward performance merman-inspired helen lawson ? hayward comes solidly out " women picture " tradition seems perfectly cast . her singing voice , supplied veteran big-band singer margaret whiting ( that mrs. jack wrangler you , ted casablanca ) , perfect match ( raw years backstage smoking ) . but , only explanation i come up ms garland fans so much wanted see her singing role they shun hayward performance out perverse loyalty garland . ( garland died two years after release vod , perhaps adding degree fierceness her fans ' loyalty . ) special edition dvd overemphasizes camp cult elements movie ( " bouncing ball " karioke rendering lawson " i'll plant my own tree " really red wig ends up cartoon toilet final sustained note song ) . such thing make fun viewing once . but movie , movie delicious treat lasts forever	1
perhaps first social injustice movies hollywood began turning out late forties , crossfire one few my opinion which still hold up . that because social message , against hate general anti-semitism particular , doesn't become too preachy get way story . unlike gentleman agreement ( anti-semitism ) , boomerang ( legal class injustice ) , pinky ( racial prejudice ) others , crossfire tells taut story first , this case murder , features some first-rate acting , especially robert ryan . murder mystery straightforward there little doubt who killer . we know man named samuels ( sam levene ) beaten death . we know suspect , corporal arthur mitchell ( george cooper ) one four recently discharged soldiers who met him bar . we know one four big , edgy guy , sergeant montgomery ( robert ryan ) , who laughs too much likes verbally poke people he thinks weak . body discovered , evidence points mitchell killer police captain finlay ( robert young ) goes work . one mitchell buddies , sergeant peter keeley ( robert mitchum ) doesn't think mitchell could killer . cautious way he starts working finlay establish alibi mitchell , then concentrate montgomery . one biggest issues what could montgomery motivation . it turns out montgomery doesn't like civilians , doesn't like " hillbillies , " hates jews . he bigot . when montgomery complains " those kinds guys " , finlay asks , " what kind guys ? " " you know kind . " montgomery says . " played it safe during war , keepin ' themselves civvies , nice apartments , swell dames ... you know kind . " " i'm not sure i . " " some ' em named samuels , some ' em funnier names . " it isn't long before we realize montgomery psychopath who hates just anyone who different . keeley help , finlay finally able lay clever trap montgomery . young fine job cop . he seen probably too much . he tired . he decent man who relies his training . " i've this job too long , " he tells keeley . " i go it only way i know how . i collect all facts possible ... most them useless . " mitchum , laconic but alert , makes nice partner finlay . he ready stand buddy he thinks incapable killing , he really doesn't like montgomery . robert ryan makes you feel uncomfortable moment you see him . there something too friendly him , something too hidden , something too ready explode . you're not surprised when he suddenly beats samuels death his fists . difference part keeley part montgomery , i think , difference role lead reputation movie star role lead reputation movie actor . i think it only when mitchum took unsympathetic roles night hunter cape fear many critics realized he first-rate film actor , not just star . time , ryan already actor reputation , but major stardom eluded him . smaller part , gloria grahame excellent dance hall hostess who might give mitchell alibi . her cat eyes pouty lips , grahame always distinctive . she paul kelly man who may or may not her husband bring uneasy almost surreal quality their scenes . crossfire solid looking noir . dvd presentation very good .	1

there bad movies , then there bad movies . " universal soldier : return " cosmically bad movie , movie so poor every aspect its execution one would look " manos : hands fate " comparison . first " universal soldier " film moderately entertaining shoot ' em up flick starring action stars jean-claude van damme " rocky " refugee dolph lundgren essentially accomplished what it set out : people perished violent ways , stuff exploded , van damme lundgren beat each other into bloody pulps end film . even presence charming ally walker van damme female sidekick greatly helped film . movie garnered enough attention fans merit release special edition dvd some time back . it unfortunately also garnered enough attention fans merit this unredeemable piece trash sequel . second , one hopes final , installment franchise should never become franchise achieves such heights utter banality stupidity i sat open-mouthed awe watching it . i think i safely say i am less person sat through this atrocity . expect spend few days coma after credits roll . van damme returns luc , reanimated soldier who triumphed over forces government sponsored evil first film . this outing he now works dr. dylan cotner ( xander berkeley ) , scientist who reconstituted universal soldier program help his supercomputer s.e.t.h. luc , his female sidekick maggie ( kiana tom ) , helps design run training missions new batch super soldiers . film opens what filmmakers hope pulse-pounding jaunt up river , jaunt filled explosions , stunts , gunfire , briefest glimpse tom incredibly fit form . mission grinds halt we learn several important things : kiana tom incredibly hot but can't act her way out paper bag , luc daughter named hillary ( karis paige bryant ) who you just know get into trouble some point , only soldiers we must pay attention romeo ( bill goldberg ) one played michael jai white . frankly , turning off film immediately after glimpsing tom amazing physique probably good thing . everything follows dull , predictable , so full plot holes defy description . " universal soldier : return " feels like eighty minutes dental surgery rather than action film . sure enough , cotner computer goes fritz unleashes killing power universal soldiers . resulting conflagration s.e.t.h. implants its consciousness michael jai white , luc his loved ones flee compound , military swoops contain problem . extraordinarily untalented actress named heidi schanz also pops nosy reporter called erin who interested exposing government latest shenanigans . predictably , van damme schanz team up track down ... er ... well , track down something defeat supercomputer . i think they need some code shut system down , but meantime film takes them all over place so wisecracking romeo follow them around while absorbing all abuse luc hand out . even throwing few scenes set adult only club can't make this turkey fly . it dull , folks , painfully so . time film grinds its inevitable showdown luc s.e.t.h. back shattered compound -- injured hillary life balancing precariously background serve motivation overwhelmed luc ( geez , what surprise there ! ) -- i knew i just wasted far too much my life this car wreck . how bad it , you ask ? read ... plot holes this film innumerable , uncountable grains sand beach or acne teenager face . example , luc explains erin he once universal soldier just like romeo but cotner " cured " him restoring him life ; he no longer needs injections or ice or any other devices used soldiers . what heck we doing marveling this amazing supercomputer when cotner just performed miracle biblical implications ? he brought someone back dead ! how exactly he accomplish this feat ? we don't find out van damme , who simply smirks his way through few lines dialogue simply boggle mind their monumentally idiotic implications . i could go , but let discuss performances instead -- or lack thereof . i should say i adore kiana tom ; she drop dead gorgeous babe body could stop earth rotation , but watching her stumble through dialogue like your appendix taken out through your mouth . problem lumbering bill goldberg , whose " funny " lines anything but . more i think heidi schanz , less i think her . you wonder film where jean-claude van damme best thespian cast . you might think movie this foolhardy shouldn't contain any bonus features dvd . you would wrong . trailers this film , " return , " " double team , " " desert heat , " " knock off , " " maximum risk , " " nowhere run " showcase dubious career jean-claude van damme . making feature , van damme career retrospective ( ha ! ) , michael jai white feature , talent bios round out disc . my advice those viewers thinking renting " universal soldier : return " ? run , my friends , run far , far away don't look back .	-1

this film , surface , seems like complete mess . it completely plotless , feels almost european its pacing ( honestly ) . i'm thinking myself , this intentional ? thomas chong really auteur , or he just really stoned out his mind when he directed this ? film itself actually really funny , it best chong directed films . scene beginning film ( cheech chong syphening gasoline ) hilarious ( remember , this made 1980 gas crisis still everyone mind ) . scene where cheech chong improvise song " beaners " ( showing cheech chong doing racial humour way before overrated carlos mencia ) great , too . all chong films laid back , times completely lackadasical feel them , so my pretentious side wondering whether thomas chong real auteur , or he just lazy stoner who managed , somehow , string together few films . discuss ...	1
john hurt portrayal fool splendid . so many productions _lear_ get this crucial character wrong ( including , unfortunately , ian holm otherwise terrific production , which i first saw pbs ) , but not sir laurence . incidentally , shinnosuke ikehata ( listed credits " peter " ) also portrayed fool memorably _ran_ , kurosawa famous adaptation _lear_ .	1
ostensibly " crossfire " police procedural finding murderer kindly jewish man post world war ii washington d.c. count i thought film telegraphed murderer little early but beside point because story here so intricately textured there many riches found . film touches not only irrational bigotry leads murder but also portrays country yes military malaise following end our 4 year campaign free world tyranny . we now peace question arises where devote our energies . it this climate where after we saved some jews nazi extermination only direct our hostilities toward jews home . film starkly lit filmed director edward dmytryk maximum effect . cast superb robert young , robert mitchum , robert ryan , gloria grahame giving some best , some cases best , performances their careers . this film nominated best picture 1947 losing " gentlemen agreement " film touching domestic anti-semitism . i recommend seeing both films but my mind " crossfire " clearly superior film	1
when i saw this movie 2002 , i thought it masterpiece . i still three years later dvd . let me give you some insite characters first . davey stone : town drunk who drinks all his problems away alcoholic since age 12 when his parents killed chanukah after getting hit truck . whitey duvall : optomistic midget who extremely behind times , poised win " dukesberry all-star patch " , award given out annual holiday banquet . also his feet aren't same size he covered fur . also frequently seizures . eleanore duvall:whitey fraternal twin sister who wears wigs without them " looks like owl " . like whitey , feet wrong size behind times , example , she tries cut corn dog off stick . jennifer friedmen:davey childhood girlfriend who recently abandoned her husband raising her son single mother . 33 works dunkin ' donuts dukesberry mall . she , most movie aspects , would considered " girl next door " . benjamin friedmen:jennifer son , who throughout film develops friendship davey . mayor stuhy duhy : mayor dukesberry , who wife once man . tom baltezor : man whose left hand replaced pirate hook . original winner 35th all-star patch , but gives it whitey . chinese waitor : waitor china dragon , one more funny roles rob schneider past few years . mrs. selman : woman three boobs . commonly refered " mrs. triple nipple " . now meat review , plot this movie isn't really good , but not very horrible . one thing i like , yet dislike amount music . i really don't like people break into song every 15 minutes or so , but songs this good . listen ! even though this animated holiday movie this isn't kids all , jokes this vulgar crude , one example would whitey his hand his pants , he says " my finger your mouth , kitty , but i don't feel no teeth " . meaning he his finger up his butt . all all , this good movie if your adam sandler fan . this movie not next " gone wind " , but good movie whatsoever .	1
ralph bakshi boho fantasy wizards , like richard williams ' doomed thief cobbler , reaction against disney animated features shares many its flaws , well many its own . all his talk wanting show disney how tell real story real passion , there real lack story worse , real lack feeling dull characters disinterested vocal performances only draw attention . but perhaps most fatal all largely uninteresting animation often seems pitched somewhere filmation underground comics , more interesting ( potentially expensive ) sequences played purely two-tone still concept images susan tyrell flat narration giving film uncompleted work-in-progress look . use crudely rotoscoped footage el cid , alexander nevsky zulu choppy battle scenes also rather too awkward work , especially since it never properly integrated genuinely animated characters . its heart there vaguely interesting notion ( it certainly not developed enough called idea ) war technology magic - embodied two brother wizards each others throats thousands years - coming head when bad one discovers motivating power nazi propaganda , but too often it simply clumsily reacting against disney formula rather than telling story you see all too clearly early signs just how badly bakshi would mess up lord rings here . still , fox dvd boasts nice widescreen transfer good selection extras - audio commentary bakshi 35-minute documentary him film , various stills galleries , tv spot two trailers .	1

seen every film version pride prejudice one obtain today , i definitely award palm this one , jennifer ehle colin firth . bbc version 1982 also charming ; its tv-standard shortcomings lighting , cinematography , editing overlooked ; but there simply no comparison firth david rintoul mr. darcy . colin firth uniquely hits off character very reserved man who forced " out himself " attraction unexpected young woman . laurence olivier too suave polished ( well too old ) carry this off well firth , evoking more air offended politician than entrenched , unawakened country gentleman . rintoul 1982 version suitably rough around edges , but works too hard displays too visibly darcy gradual thawing presence elizabeth bennet . firth hides it better , character darcy would , while still letting viewer process . i enjoy elizabeth garvie 1982 version , but i equally well satisfied jennifer ehle elizabeth bennet . if she not come off quite youthful garvie ( ehle only her late 20s when she made pp ) , i find her more convincing girl who prizes wit excels it . delightful very pretty actress , she seems well matched her mr. darcy . most secondary characters nicely this 1995 version , which far best mr. bennet any cinematic pp . other stand-outs include jane bennet lady catherine de bourgh . i preferred only one character 1982 version : mr. collins , whose foolishness better served large , doughy actor than rather ferret-like ( if hysterical ) david bamber ' 95 remake . ( larger mr. collins also , course , truer austen original . ) grand scale which characters live this version probably not true jane austen world environment created ( smaller budgets ) previous films . sense infusion american money decried some reviewers regrettable ; but it certainly makes entertaining scenery . beyond anachronistic freedom manner younger miss bennets , other questionable aspect social environment evoked this version incessant curtseying bowing persons all ages social status . i notice american-oriented films depicting regency england usually replete it , whereas films made brits british audiences not	1

okay , if you don't like this movie then my opinion your not horror movie fan . anyone who grew up 1980 knows loves jason voorhees ! only reason you wouldn't fan because your one those stuck up , horror movie snobs who only likes movies such halloween other over rated played out slasher flicks . jason goes hell - final friday ( only it wasn't last ) one more creative friday 13th movies ever made ! sure there might some rather small plot holes here or there but thats no big deal . considering series gone this far , i think it amazing director pulled off something so creative ! instead jason run through woods entire film , chopping up teenagers who bearly act , director decided go different direction . movie starts typical friday 13th scene , attractive woman all herself camp crystal lake . she walks one cabins then eventually decides take shower . pretty stypical stuff usual slasher movie bimbo . soon enough however , we ( fans ) discover she member government s.w.a.t team , sent destroy jason voorhees . jason killer tons people , i'm actually quite shocked government ( or whoever handles there situations ) hadn't stepped sooner ! anyways , they find jason unleash everything they got him . after shooting him bunch bullets finally blowing his body bloody chunks , everyone thinks jason finally dead . what they don't know they're dead wrong ! ( sorry silly pun ) here where i think jason goes hell well . director explains how jason able come back all those times , through all those sequals . it actually idea i myself early days 80 sequals . jason heart takes shape form some creature hell . whenever host body ( whoever jason happens using time ) becomes too nasty it use anymore , it basically uses host . otherwords , it simple body snatchers plot . rest movie we watch helpless victems fall prey jason demon heart , taking over their bodies . soon we discover plot detail helps movie but us friday 13th fans , know it plot hole . no big deal considering it dosn't hurt anything long run actually helps story movie better . jason sister ( if you remember first friday 13th , jason mother said she only one child ) order become reborn again , he needs take over her body . you tell , jason goes hell alot more plot details creative story twists than most other ones series . i won't go into anymore detials movie , you just sit back watch blood fly ! ending also treat us horror fans too ! something any respected friday 13th fan waited see many years eventually blessed it later down road . i won't spoil anything if you haven't seen movie , you'll just watch it . over all , jason goes hell - final friday wonderful addition anyones friday 13th series gore hounds should enjoy much here ! it fun movie gives fans what they want see . more plot , more story , more gore ( get unrated version ) more jason ! anyone who thinks they're " above " this movie terms horror fan , get lost ! you don't belong here ! obviously slasher scene isn't you .	1

several years ago , i started my personal list 5 greatest movies ever made . four films made list . i finally fifth one . sure , it kind cheesy , deformed guy kind lame , ending kind ho-hum , but some reason , i loved this film . elizabeth berridge amy terrific . it true teens choose spend night funhouse not all sympathetic , but least they react way people might actually react . they aren't perfect , none us . amy sneaks out , lies her parents , smokes pot , sneaks into places without paying etc . what kind teenage behavior ? well son gun , this almost normal . tobe hooper some really good movies but this one deserves more acclaim . i loved it i loved ending camera pulled away landscape funhouse . funhouse itself creepy distrubing . not place i would choose hang out my girlfriend night , but hey ... girl would want spend night me funhouse probably someone i shouldn't going out first place , but that story . i suggest you rent it if you find it then if you like it , buy it . if you can't find it rent , buy it . i don't think you disabpointed .	1
i saw ad this ( popular stoner magazine ) few years back , thought " hey , i'd like get ! " , then promptly forgot it . i rediscovered it while searching through amazon.com stoner comedies , after seeing tommy chong own review , decided i it . basically , i loved it . yep , little weak places , but they weren't trying make cinematic masterpiece here . i'd put this same category movies like " deuce bigalow : male gigolo " or , more similar time period , " adventures ford fairlane : rock roll detective " starring andrew dice clay , one my favorite cheeseball comedies late eighties/early nineties . oh , that one other thing - i could've sworn this movie made ( released ) recently - copyright dvd says 2001 , all reviews info i read led me believe it recent flick . maybe just oversight my part , but it actually made 1989 . personally , makes it even more enjoyable me , i love finding flicks i missed my youth , get see now first time . then i get show it all my friends , who then similarly amazed they hadn't heard it , either . it definitely fun hobby :) [** few very minor spoilers ahead , those who haven't watched it yet **] so anyway , like " ford fairlane " , this movie hit miss times , but when it hits , it hits great , some real goofball humor you'll instantly quoting your friends end movie . also like " ford fairlane " , this movie bunch cool cameos , either playing random characters , or more typically , playing themselves . brief cheech spot utterly unexpected one biggest laughs movie . dokken jamming out tommy house also unexpected sight . thomas howell scene judd nelson simply amazing , howell utterly floored judd nelson never heard him . ( like howell , i also thought nelson kicked much butt " hip " , infrequently seen but highly enjoyable 80s comedy ) howell line , " you've seen ( random porn title ) but never saw red dawn ?!? " laugh-riot , i totally agree . judd nelson live under rock eighties , or what ? red dawn = must see movie ! conclusion , i really , really liked this movie . mad respect tommy chong family putting this together . end , i guess martin mull hypnotic suggestion ( " you'll like this movie . tell friend . " ) made actual impression me . i liked this movie , i'll telling lot friends . check this out sure - long you love goofy comedies , you'll dig it . it far out , man . :	1

now three great hulot films rereleased criterion , we enjoy them pristine quality affordable price ... but new playtime dvd completely updated two disc set warrants new review its own . first all , film , towering , nearly impenetrable achievement comedy world , visually cleaned up features crisp , clear sound , which makes it easier than ever before take dive into tati insular world ... enough already written film itself : some love it , some hate it ; my suggestion watch open mind , least couple times , reviewer wrote , you " active participant " appreciate this film : tati camera won't direct your attention you . i also recommend hulot holiday mon oncle should viewed first . i can't stress enough how great extras . if you're tatiphile already own copy playtime , i'd still recommend this release . there hours documentaries but real jewels interviews great man himself . speaking slightly stilted english , tati passionately articulates unique comic philosophy informed his films his career progressed he shows no regrets toward making film bankrupted him baffled critics distributers alike time ( film conceived international audience mind , but wasn't screened u.s , example , until 1970s ) . during course interview , tati also assesses his career within larger context film comedy makes some comparisons work earlier greats such keaton particularly chaplin . put simply , i've never viewed more fascinating extra criterion release i look forward revisiting his films even greater appreciation than ever before	1
i think very few actresses could pull off juliette binoche feat . ok , none come mind : binoche one woman tour-de-force , example universal present counter-point during conference led cultural relativists . i watched this part trilogy last : red first , then white , then blue . i think some reviewers this movie impose quite narrow definition liberty , one might -- or might not -- dovetail kieslowski own . we know very little julie vignon relationship her husband child prior their tragedy . i believe this intentional critical aspect this film . face horrible circumstance julie vignon one thing she knows she : depend her strength , resources , clarity thought . i not think it necessarily case her suicidal impulse pos t-t ragedy driven entirely her loss : bereft , certainly . but she clearly complicated marital situation , coupled whole other life - both inner extra-marital , plus mess rabid public face : short , i think it would force all these circumstances would drive her knee-jerk action she ultimately not take . this " liberty " not just vignon understanding liberty , but , rather , contemplation meaning liberty both personal national levels ( what liberty mean unified or " united europe " ? married person ? widowed person ? street musician ? prostitute ? addled mother ? ) . vignon not cold ; fact , quite opposite : she pragmatic rational - not even hyper-rational . she wholly good she generous ( wonderful line uttered sandrine latter part movie ) . reflects flip side color blue perhaps double-meaning runs throughout this movie . yes , blue - color cold , lack feeling . but what blue , color peace tranquility ? loyalty ? productiveness ? sparkle ? strength ? i watched this movie alone : me it required concentration , certain state mind . i know some people who thought it would played better faster slow mo rewind , but if you liked color paradise eternity day , other movies unfolded their own pace but didn't skimp beauty , you might like kieslowski blue . this one chew , i look forward watching it again	1
i hate this movie ! because it protrays 17-year-old girls such negative light . i'm almost 17 years old i felt disgusted adults think all teenagers smoke drugs drink when they really don't . real life , teenage girls don't kind stuff . i think hollywood producers should make movies girls following their dreams finding themselves rather than they drugs overdose die . it so disgusting media presents teenagers like this public then adults think that what young girls like . i don't think i ever seen movie seventeen-year-old girl like this ever . it worst movie i've ever seen my whole entire life i shouldn't seen it begin . i'm sorry i wasted my time watching this piece crap . i love sandra bullock , i think she cool woman great actress , but this piece trash too horrible words . it sick ! don't watch this all !!!!!!!	-1

this film carax his most mature , simply following paths godard truffaut their inevitable conclusion , sort enforced envolution cinematic language . i liken carax gustave mahler : half-disillusioned possibilities his influences , but still dedicated seeing them through end . there not much else say film . either you see where he going or you don't; either you respect innovation or you don't; either you're onboard experimentation or you're seasick , yet still docked . end , shutting down too quickly may mean missing out new artistic language , new development structure meaning . any case , it never hurts hear little scott walker , especially schizophrenic walker heard here , i.e. tilt . avant-garde never looked more ... pleasantly dissonant	1

one most compelling events release kenneth lonergan you count me it gave visibility mark ruffalo who plays troubled young man who , unable deal childhood trauma lost his parents car crash , lives life unattached agony isolation . he loner drifter , medicating his self-pity pot short-lived relationships . his sister sammy , played wonderfully laura linney , reacts same tragedy , many ways , overresponsible overcontrolling super mom . two opposite reactions same tragedy course result sibling clash . this film shows great complexity biting comic insight , attempt this brother sister shed their defense mechanisms most importantly reconnect one . ride never easy this film . no easy answers given . just important , this film , which deals pain loss , never descends into maudlin hallmark movie sap other films would . balancing edgy humor profound psychological insight , lonergan written directed tale captures layers upon layers psychological complexity accompany trauma loss . amazingly , he it fast-paced film scenes turns comic dramatic . matthew broderick , example , plays hilarious role sammy neurotic anal-retentive boss bank . conflict him sammy leads plot point i'll let you discover film . but most all , this film shines because mark ruffalo plays such endearing , sympathetic , sometimes infuriating character . you won't forget him	1
touching wartime musical some great tunes ever-incomparable judy garland lead , what more could you want ? maybe historical value gene kelly screen debut ? maybe . garland , her first " grown-up " role , looks absolutely fantastic onscreen , glowing lighting up every shot . second viewing , i found myself wishing dialogue scenes would hurry make way musical numbers , 19-year-old judy garland electrifies scenes such " after you've gone " " how ya gonna keep em down farm . " you see exactly why she often named world best entertainer ; her stage presence , discernable even black white transfer , brilliant . while garland didn't prove her true acting chops until " star born " , which she gave obviously oscar-worthy performance , she still tugs appropriately heart-strings when called upon so . gene kelly acting clearly amateur this stage , but who blame him , it his first picture after all . we'll forgive him brilliant work he later ( magnificent dancing talent , course , which sadly under-used this film ) . sure it sappy , sentimental , predictable , but who cares ?! it pure escapist fun judy , gene , wonderful music ride ! so sit back enjoy yourself . i most ridiculous grin my face whole time	1

everybody who says this , i ask , you seen drunken young master ? because these 2 foar superior . i am not trying discredit your opinion , but far modern movies go , this may his best , least since people america known who he . so story jackie beating people up when they trying force workers work overtime without getting paid , then they fire them when job they don't need them anymore . director lau kar leung(i think jackie left his name this , i mean he freaking it ) plays part officer who investigating something going factory people smuggling ancient artifacts out china . so other words story kinda sucks(at least this cut version it really sucks ) main thing watch action . i kind hate it when this happens becuae there not enough fights this bad story . i only think like 6-7 good fights this movie . now once again we may not getting all fights because this cut version . character wise only person who stands out me late great anita mui . she far best character actor/actress this movie . so end we get really spectacular fight , but my favorite one where they hired axe gang take out jackie . jackie absolutely top form here , not like he wasn't other scenes , they just didn't mix stunts fighting like they this scene . i know jackie break least one bone shooting this scenes , i don't know this factually , but you watch this tell me if there any known actor world who this . oh yeah , this like 16 years after he made real drunken master . something i don't really care fact they don't even mention real drunken master this movie . real drunken master simon yuen , his son yuen woo-ping all crazy footwork . so there really 2 drunken masters , except screen they only show old man dm . so , even though nobody drunken style like jackie screen , woo-ping could pull it off even better , but he not actor . so i am just saying it would really helped this movie if they least mentioned drunken master , but now everybody just knows jackie drunken master because they not seen original know idea who simon yuen . course they know who woo-ping , they don't realize it his dad who pushed this movie over top become huge blockbuster china . if anybody wants see far superior movie this than make sure you check out original if you want see movie slightly better than drunken master than you should check out very unknown dance drunken mantis . this movie brings back real drunken master introduces us northern drunken boxing champion . yes that right , we get drunken master doesn't doubled , hwang jang lee . i won't leave his sidekick corey yuen out either . now this movie chief fox iron monkey playing jackie role , this would easily top 10 movie all-time if they could gotten jackie , or lee yi-min , or kid 7 steps kung fu . but instead we just get top 50 all-time kung fu movie . i let you know right now , seriously , beware drunken mantis style . so yeah , movie pretty good , not story action , anita mui delightful character gives it 4/5 . also dvd quality great widescreened picture all-important french language track english those us who wanna try listen it . i would definitely advise you seek out chinese verion if this really one your favorite movies , because this almost bad jet li dubs . drunken style real gungfu style folks , if mastered real life you just deadly jackie . kungfumagazine.com some good articles it if you interested martial arts .	1
when i saw this its first run , i didn't know it box office flop . it anything but me . it most inspiring film my youth ! i can't think any other film caused me something my young life . i procured copies original engineering drawings plane made detailed working scale model . subsequently i chose engineering profession . after seeing film i read both " we " " spirit st. louis . " movie surprisingly close latter . i am glad we cinemascope dolby 5.1 version this personal classic . i don't know why this film flopped 1957 , but i think stewart age less it than others saying . it made 10 years earlier , it would not cinemascope , sound would suffered , billy wilder might not directed . i wouldn't want give those things up stewart " right " age . it great film played actor passionate part it tells great story . .... case where ticket-buying-public didn't get it right	1

amazon offering promotion where you supposed get free tv show whenever you buy dvd dec . well , they charged me it , i didn't really want it . i just thought i'd try it because it free . there no verification before you charged either . it supposed free , you hit button , boom , there charge your credit card . never again !!! .. directions don't work , so i don't even " free " stuff i paid	-1

quite possibly , stupidest movie ever made . " well-written " -- could fooled me . " artfully shot " -- i guess it its moments , especially if you like lot very black shadows covering most what you want see , but rest it no better than standards crappy 60 tv . " finely edited " -- i guess there art cutting real turkeynot campfest , not comedy , just plain bad . get some busty dolls some dopey guys , throw them stew , show some teasers breasts , add cheesy , dashed-off script guy who suddenly exemplars " i say , not i " plan it becoming " cult classic . " this not " rocky horror picture show " ! you'd so much more fun watching one again instead . roger ebert , you really chuckle when you remember this one claim movie making fame ? i thought your profession helping people not waste their time . you sure wasted mine	-1
this one my all-time faves . i own it already but need copy case something should happen mine . i first saw this movie years ago ; it . lines cast uses hilarious-altho it wasn't meant comedy , it it moments . all all , my fave bill paxton flick	1
i always avid fan westerns general , charlton heston particular , but this one those movies where legend surrounding it far exceeds actual viewing , even allowing its butchered studioscharlton heston course , plays major dundee , man very forceful character - resolute , determined , even rebellious ( " invading " mexico attacking french army ) . such man later found hopeless drunk wallowing gutters durango thoroughly incomprehensible . purpose " invasion " mexico capture or destroy apache indian , charriba , so one would expect audience watch movie anticipation great climax when two sides finally meet . when they meet however , action over less than minute , charriba simply shot michael anderson jnr . so climax , my view , anti-climax . we then presented new climax , when dundee his men defeat french army order get back across rio grande . although this encounter lot more exciting than one apaches , overall effect , far i am concerned , rather like effect one gets when reading murder mystery discover murderer somebody who only entered final pages ( scene where wounded richard harris single-handedly takes other half french army so unexpected view what gone before , virtually unbelieveable ) . regard movie heavily cut studios , i would suggest if any cuts made , they should cut durango scenes entirely , plus all scenes featuring senta berger . romance only slows down action adds nothing story , whilst too much romance leads boredom . finally , watched movie new score first , then original score , i say i preferred original . movie opens charriba saying upside down strung-up soldier , " who you going send after me now ? " original then opening title , " major dundee , " accompanied mitch miller sing gang singing major dundee march . me this much more stirring rousing score than new replacement , sets scene what one hopes exciting movie . all means buy this dvd piece movie history , part either charlton heston or sam peckinpah collection ( even though peckinpah disowned it ) , but my money don't expect western anything like great likes big country , magnificent seven , or how west won .	1
finally , this fine motion picture survives dvd - due shortly . george segal , max von sydow , senta berger round out fine cast this british outing filmed berlin . song " wednesday child " prominent throughout - even referenced name dialog . quiller ( george segal ) sent his lead contact , played alec guinness , infiltrate neo-nazi organisation - despite fact two agents ' lives already sacrificed their respective attempts . quiller tenacity tempered his belief enemy may saturated all around him - including his own " side " . genre cold war spy significant 1960 when this film released . classic spy films like " ipcress file " , " spy who came cold " , " quiller memorandum " offset campy spy spoofs like " like flint " , " our man flint " , matt helm films . course , there many more popular spy pictures . list spy movies this decade - including james bond movies - would lengthy indeed . difference , course , gags , gals , gimmicks . real intelligence work , depending application operation , not glitzy or glamorous - it tedious , numbing , painstaking , quite boring most instances . , like " quiller " , operative may not know those people trusted . one can't help but identify quiller - if anything , he resourceful clever . this one worth checking out - great scenery , great locations , senta berger	1

all too often when consumers run across interesting movie they never heard before , they make decision buy or rent it based packaging instead writing down name show then looking up reviews it . this approach makes consumers playthings unscrupulous marketers . one such company anchor bay entertainment this summer released 1988 flick called " dead next door " dvd . packaging this dvd touted this movie lost horror classic now resurfaced . fact , its labelled " collector edition " " making " documentary added dvd . such lengths anchor bay gone order deceive uninformed customers . marketing claims only partly right . dead next door really " lost " horror flick out sight ( not even cable television ) since it originally released 1988 . however , it not classic , unless you consider poorly made features " classics " their own right . think latter day ed wood type production made evenless talent than found ed wood movies . dead next door brainchild akron , ohio teenager named j.r. bookwalter who somehow persuaded hollywood movie maker sam raimi put up financing flick shot super 8 . gratitude , bookwalter named lead role " raimi " one lesser roles " dr. savini " after sam raimi associate tom savini . name evil cult leader named rev . jones honor real life rev . jim jones who responsible jonestown mass suicide 1978 . how original . dead next door good example what happens when teenager no real movie making experience given miniscule budget make feature length flick . abandoned houses , high school serve unconvincingly high tech labs , government offices headquarters zombie cult . plot completely unimaginative , acting just plain awful , original actors voices clumsily dubbed back sound completely wooden . while watching this , you find yourself frequently looking your watch even though flick only 84 minutes long . case so many today shot video ( sov ) horror flicks , dead next door comes off looking really cheap gives impression just thrown together over weekend hopes cashing cool box art , intriguing title gullible movie fans . good reason since dead next door shot just few days comes across cheapjack production made haste but little talen t.t he dead next door horror flick so bad it bad . both this flick subsequent productions , j.r. bookwalter shows lack eye detail total unoriginality resulted his name mud among knowledgeable horror flick fans . any event , dead next door waste both your time money no matter how low price you get it	-1

spoilers , but i'm sure most people know this movie already ..... i suppose what would disappoint bela lagosi fans he not vampire , but vampire actor . what really makes this film shine through not bela , but " luna " -a very beautiful gothic woman who amazing vampire stares , looks like pure goth . it basically detective movie but not disappointing one .. lots women screaming , vampire scenes suprisingly well ; even bat props look real . it bugs , rats , crawling spiders , very well fog . movie only 60 minutes long :-( so i would consider this more " moviette " or mini-movie . i found it very satisfying . too bad it only available vhs .	1
i first watched this film when i teenager 20 years ago , i really touched it . now , 20 years later , amid mediocrity characterizes most ( but , fortunately , not totality ) films made during past 30 years , i appreciate novecento even more . obviously , like every masterpiece , this film its own demands : not expect easy-going film . impressive photography ; well chosen cast ( except , perhaps , deniro which i never considered good actor most people ); film intent ... some features convert novecento gem .	1
only thing kept me watching this movie see if there going twilight zone-type ending tied it all together . remember zone where five wildly-different people ( clown , cowboy , ballerina , etc . ) trapped round room , when they finally escape , you find out they're just dolls trash ? it lame zone , but i thought watching this movie kelly lynch wanted stay inside abandoned desert house -- wondered if house going place life death . kelly might hovering two room her new " husband " satan . or angel . something really off-the-wall . but it didn't happen . it pretty much straight-forward story dysfunctional low-lifes trying figure out their messy lives -- without telling us very much themselves . acting very good kelly lynch looks great naked ( even bandages her wrists wearing dirty hosptial gown whole movie ) , but story gets lost desert . what heck happened baby shows up couple scenes then disappears ? that what i wondering rest movie but nothing more said	1
i watched this movie first time since early 90s amazed what wonderful picture it . film nominated best picture , best actor nick notle best supporting actress kate neligan - unfortunately , miss striesand not nominated best director , which surely misfortune because it she who coaxed these marvelous performances these actors . watch it love it	1
child 9 , who recently lost her 30 year old father cancer , i viewed this movie ( 6 times ) theatre , when it first came out ( circa 1966 , san jose , ca ) . perhaps it because i extremely sad impressionable period my life , but movie lifelong impact my political views values . upon finding dvd amazon , i purchased it , after viewing it now , woman my late 40 , i feel same way i when i child . very wary government so afraid their constituency , they would reduce them mindless robots , placated substance abuse , religion , willing turn everyone who didn't fit or comply . we heading there , america . i heartened yesterday , when after viewing this dvd me , my teenaged granddaughter told me she discussed movie her literature teacher . turn , her teacher asked if she could borrow movie , share entire class . i am donating my original copy her teacher class , ordering myself . perhaps our youth once again bring change , peace , freedom , honesty , caring back into america . i hope live long enough see day .	1
after several viewings when much younger , watched again . why this movie work ? it built very weak premises . main characters aren't particularly interesting or complex . yet . it seems capture moment " falling love . " most beautifully way rarely shown movies . you see it happen -- during visit nicky grand-mother riviera . you wonder simplicity it : sharing emotion , beauty time , music , setting , view , chapel , so loving elderly grandmother . later , reunion stopped freak accident , gives film turn caught imagination movie goers past 50 years ! believable , realistic love story , however , david lean brief encounter much closer perfection	1
jon heder excellent his breakout role . i watch any movie hes no	1

i got this dvd out library mainly out curiosity , i admit like reviewer i not really expecting find this riveting , especially it german sub-titles well just one person speaking unseen interviewer , answering questions years she ( traudl junge ) spent hitler youngest secretary until fall bunker berlin 1945 . i sat watched this dvd without getting up break , it so fascinating i also surprised i felt some compassion traudl junge , after all she worked cruel despot who ordered murder millions innocent people which included not only those jewish race but gypsies , people who dared openly gay , jehovah witnesses so many others i don't enough room this critique name them . traudl junge ability bring out me , hardened cynic when it comes nazis their crimes against humanity , any kind compassion , shocked socks off me i tell you . i sat listened this old very dignified woman who made no attempt excuse who what she during war but she never came across ( least me ) apologist hitler , rather she saw foolishness her youth absolute banality evil into which she many other dropped into such ease . she also gave insight into man who become enigma , she not make him human , he lost his humanity long ago , but she gave sense who he through her dialogue , how charming he could , his odd little foibles such him ardent vegetarian his passion dogs , all qualities what should endear you person but this case only repel you when you learn who person these qualities . blind spot surprisingly riveting , you want hear what traudl say i ended up watching it all one go when i thought i would flick through it watch it piece meal if all . worth watching , if you get chance see film " downfall " also read book " until final hour - hitler last secretary , " all three help you understand person , traudl junge also who man she worked , where traudl i some compassion , hitler i no compassion whatsoever even after watching one film , one documentary reading one book looks his life through eyes other people no matter who person , you still find him wanting	1
1975 good year movies likes " one flew over cuckoo nest " , " jaws " , " dog day afternoon " , , my favorite year , " dersu uzala " . there couple popular movies year i never got around seeing ; " nashville " " shampoo " . i finally got see " shampoo " other night , frankly , i disappointed . what disappointed me whole concept main character , george , played warren beatty . he just too important too many ways too many people come across believable . i wasn't surprized see , co-writer , beatty created his own character level . i still give movie decent rating because it well-directed , well-acted , moves pretty well . it probably bit edge 1975 ( major motion picture , ) still would inappropriate younger ones . i gather it political commentary because so much background involves nixon/agnew campaign 1972 . i'm no big fan either those politicians but i came away thinking they got better script somehow . i hope movie also comment sexual revolution those days . there plenty it little emotion or purpose ( other than obvious ) . indeed , sex comes across loser richard spiro pr race . george can't get enough it laments he just can't pass up pretty woman . then we led believe he actually emotionally involved one many he physically involved . it hard tell which one would , however . end he makes his choice but , then , she seems uninterested we . lee grant won best supporting oscar her role wife jack warden character . she alright her role but seems benefitted lack competition . one who stand out jack warden . he excellent smooth operating money-managing , wife-cheating , where's-the-party sort guy who always seems control ( or , least enough control anyone seems this movie ) . his competition oscar year , however , george burns his memorable role " sunshine boys " . i like good satire but i didn't see one " shampoo " . i guess thirty years waiting left me underwhelmed . i hope i get better reaction " nashville " when i finally get see one .	1

i just saw this movie i very impressed genre bank robbers . i very happy one hand movie took " gay theme " swing it movie didn't involve aids people dying . other hand it took negative swing because it didn't give very good portrayal gay relationships either . honest here , if it " straight " couple relationship way it portrayed , i would not thought anything it . i would thought it like any other unhealthy relationship out there . no , but it portrayed " gay " relationship so i see where it disturbed me probably others well . i others come realization all relationships unhealthy . they don't " straight or gay " unhealthy . also , they bank robbers petes sake . there something wrong them people ( gay or straight ) anyway if they robbing banks . there one thing i say this " gay themed " portrayal , robbers not queeny or flamboyant giving " weak " view gay men . so me , positive thing . i recommend this movie wants something different not your " run mill " gay movie	1
michael keaton perfect this role . no one else could played part . he selfish , demanding , self-centered hard headed most all full fear . slowly he begins change even though chaos all around him . not only this good movie addicts/alkies , jail inmates , etc . people who trying control addict/alkie would also benefit this , there no way control someone elses addiction . it very entertaining . there some hysterically funny scenes once aa not made fun . i couldn't find it rent it so i bought watched if 3 times all ready .	1

forget friday 13th part 1 . sure it first series but dosn't always make it best ! friday 13th part one good film some people might even consider it one best horror movies ever made . personal level , i think first almost every horror series ( halloween , nightmare elm street , friday 13th ) over rated way too played out . too many people talk first series like it only good thing horror general . granted , some sequals really crappy ( robocop 3 perfect example sequal gone bad ) but dosn't mean every sequal bad . think it moment . if there never sequal friday 13th movie , we would never even know who jason voorhees or all those wonderful sequals down road ! after all , jason never came until second movie . which brings us actual film , friday 13th part 2 . it perfect sequal all levels , giving fans more what they want . horror movie sequals ( especially slasher flicks ) need few things them make fans happy . blood guts almost always needed horror sequals . more better ! buckets blood fact . thing , attractive women dying horrible ways ( mainly due their own stupidity ) expected usual . what would horror movie if dumb blonde wasn't doing something stupid gets her killed !?! last , horror movie sequal needs tie up loose ends left over first movie . friday 13th part 2 all those expected things handles it rather well process . basically plot this sequal simple , more kids die camp cyrstal lake ( aka ) " camp blood " because they're stupid . movie starts off rather thrilling enjoyable moment right off bat . sake those who haven't seen this movie yet , i won't spoil anything you . fastforward little bit into movie ( skip some less important details ) movie set up yet round " slash ' em up " friday 13th style ! all means friday 13th part 2 great example sequal right ! if you've never seen friday 13th movie before , start off first two . if you find yourself enjoying " teen slasher scene " , move other classic sequals series . friday 13th never let me down ( not once ) terms gore i think it safe say most horror fans share same opinion matter . if your one those " horror fans " who only enjoys first series , stop reading this review right now ! go back watching halloween part 1 tenth time pretend sequals never happend . everyone else ( gore hounds real horror fans ) enjoy splatter plot turns ! friday 13th part 2 perfect sequal alot ways . i've said my bit , over out !	1

midnight clear ( keith gordon , 2002)keith gordon probably best remembered playing arnie cunningham john carpenter so-so film version stephen king so-so novel christine . gordon , however , hung up acting togs late eighties went behind camera , it here he truly shined , turning out such brilliant movies waking dead television genius such series house , dexter , homicide : life street . man amazing track record . so it some confusion i regard those works where gordon comes off somewhat less accomplished . midnight clear one them . based novel william wharton , midnight clear story world war ii platoon ( full misfits , natch ) who ordered scout out mansion inside enemy territory . they encounter enemy -- but not enemy they expect . survivors german platoon house down hill looking surrender . two groups spend companionable christmas together before they turn task deciding how get each other out situation they've found themselves -- enemies wartime becoming friends . this not your typical war film ; characterization much more important than action here , many other substandard war films this stripe ( hart war tigerland immediately come mind ) , it almost seems if director wanted still play it action film . there not enough real character development here float entire movie ; we get know our main character well enough , character upon whom entire plot turn later . we get little less guy who here purpose building sympathy . rest platoon , very little , enemy , nothing . we know more back-line lieutenant -- minor character best -- than we germans . not up standards set either gordon or wharton . *	1

it one great romantic movies celebrated english duo , michael powell emeric pressburger , who both wrote directed it . " i know where i'm going , " released 1947 ; but it just not well known their " red shoes , " or " stairway paradise . " this film stars young , charm-to-burn wendy hiller , joan webster , middle class young englishwoman who knows exactly where she going : island killoran ( mythical ) off island mull , scottish hebrides : marry sir robert bellinger , her immensely wealthy boss . however , weather need not cooperate her . storms keep her stuck mull long enough meet fall love torquil mcneil , laird vicinity ( it his island house bellinger rented . ) mc neil , played roger livesey ( erstwhile colonel blimp ) modest fellow , but pretty handy gaelic poetry when it counts . island mull enlivened some sturdy supporting players : pamela brown , finlay currie , young singer petula clark girl glasses . finally , hiller begins panic rain seems melting her plans , her resolve . she insists ferried out further island , risking her own life , lives laird young couple , well . but weather not allow her leave mull it ultimately too late . movie filmed black white , it beautifully shot any powell pressburger ever made . scotland sometimes harsh landscapes look dreamy mists ; hiller train trip across united kingdom textbook example flavorful economy . special effects boys wonders tools then hand create fierce ocean whirlpool described local " legend corryvrecka . " film probably bit sentimental its portrayals happy villagers singing dancing , probably accurate its portrayal society still not far removed feudal : those villagers sure tug their forelocks when laird hoves into view . its musical score , featuring ancient scottish song title , quite lovely . listen , if you're romantic , go ride	1

man movie camera film you're either going love or hate , it unlikely you'll find comfortable mid-ground . it silent , russian made , experimental . it opens manifesto rejecting inter-title cards , affinity or reliance theater literature . it won't reject any tricks cinema , though - including stop-action animation , slow motion , times dizzying , machine fire montages . it uses documentary footage tell its story . although it doesn't tell traditional story movie structure . it opens empty movie hall , records projectionist queuing up reel one . cuts hall , stop-action animates chairs unfolding . cuts orchestra - conductor baton raised , orchestra readied suspended . enter audience . love it or hate it , this movie never forgets it movie . i loved it . i loved when projector started real movie started . journey - one movie takes - well described second american title , `living russia . ' we seem spend most movie following man old , hand-cranked , tripod supported movie camera he travels through some russian city or other . we , over his shoulder , seem go everywhere observe everything - young woman sleeping bed , people sleeping park benches , store-front mannequins rest . eventually woman bench sleepers awake , mannequins animated , we travel time through work recreational life city . then it foundry , cigarette packing plant , beach , volleyball court .... some people find this art house movie terribly self-absorbed its lack conventional narrative frustrating . if you only like movies throw good story you probably won't care much this film . if you're not sure give this one try - beneath it lack `story ' fascinating story written celluloid , vibrant , wry , witty .	1
title character not get much screen time this film . he doesn't even get any lines ( most his yells so you can't see his mouth ) . this really story jane . jane decided go africa search her father who left her her mother many years before . way she must defend her virtue , kill crew boat she hired , pilot boat her father . there she finds man who seems his brains baked sun little too long . eventually they all go off search escarpment find elephant graveyard . once top they find giant inland sea bizarre tribe living near graveyard ( we only see one dead elephant so time i not know " graveyard " found ) . they also run into tarzan who habit not speaking passing out whenever he exerts himself . i really got feeling only thing any film creators knew tarzan what they learned johnny weissmuller films . escarpment seems half continent . it nearly impossible climb so i don't know how dying elephants manage get up it . jane experiences bizarre tribe ( where she gets painted white ) seem lifted ursula andress film slave cannibal god . there very little right this film ( other than it finally end ) . jane goes super-able frightened schoolgirl but eventually falls tarzan reconciles her father . but end it not really worth watching . viewers who hoping see bo derek nude , almost all found during closing credits so you might well just skip right them .	1

i'll home christmas your typical fluffy holiday movie . if you don't like fluffy , feel good movies happy endings , chances you won't like this movie . but , those us who aren't quite so cynical , this movie pretty good . i don't really care jessica biel acting ability , so that basically my only issue it . other hand , i felt jonathan taylor thomas ( j.t.t. he known my teenybopper sister back his heyday ) perfect his role .

all its low reputation , samuel bronston much-mocked king kings easily best most intelligent `devotional ' versions life christ , largely because it sets jesus historical figure , degree , victim history politics troubled times . more importantly , it manages it without relentlessly dreary one-note george stevens ' greatest story ever told , which becomes more endurance test each passing year . even vigorously-staged battle scenes serve real dramatic purpose , pitting barabbas ' davidic warrior would-be messiah against jesus ' spiritual deliverer ( " i am fire , he water - how we ever meet ? " ) many ways real conflict film : fight material pragmatism ( romans , herod , barabbas ) spiritual idealism ( jesus his followers ) . even caiphas given very modern reading , not black-hearted villain but unpopular roman-appointed religious leader who genuinely cares his flock , fearing jesus ' popularity could used romans start holocaust destroy his people . there much imagination work too : while jeffrey hunter messiah suffers mgm insistence redubbing part more `masterful ' tones , he proactively interacts crowd sermon mount , played almost like press conference , while last supper takes its visual design not da vinci but cnd peace symbol . casting variable - robert ryan john baptist , hurd hatfield pontius pilate , harry guardino barabbas , ron randell centurion , guy rolfe caiphas gregoire aslan great frank thring herod sr. jr. fine , but rip torn surprisingly awkward otherwise well-conceived judas iscariot doomed compromise , royal dano simon peter better idea paper than onscreen ( particularly when given dialog ) siobhan mckenna eminently punchable misty-eyed mary tad too oirish catlic my tastes . yet despite its weaknesses virtual sidelining jesus much running time - this more film his times his effect those around him than his life - it never less than totally involving , often genuinely moving . despite reputedly losing interest post-production , nicholas ray direction excellent , his mastery wide screen making great use 70mm format showing real inspiration his handling some miracles , scenes greatly enhanced miklos rozsa superlative score . even ray bradbury poetic narration , beautifully delivered orson welles , originally intended quick fix paper over cracks narrative , genuinely adds film complex political picture occupied territory . not some cracks aren't still visible , meaningful exchange looks temple steps jesus richard johnson ( whose constantly changing part - one day freed gladiator , next arab , next romanized jew - otherwise totally deleted ) . but they're minor complaints extraordinary epic achieves more its ambitions than its given credit . incidentally , how earth they get obscene graffiti barracks walls past censors 1961 ? less obvious dvd copy , you can't miss it 70mm prints!warner dvd beautiful transfer , unlike mgm/ua slightly cropped laserdisc issue , correct aspect ratio . extras thin , though - teaser trailer brief newsreel footage	1
cary grant ingrid bergman make superb team together , it really shame they only acted together once before , " notorious " ( which i would also recommend anyone see ) . ingrid really perfect this role , considering she just reproofed her scandal overseas married man , she shines , especially those moments rare , open comedy ( moment when she screams " how dare he make love me not married man " then shrieks loudy before stomping off into her bedroom hilarious -- not simply because line bit ironic statement , but because you would not normally expect her something nature . ) cary grant , , course , sublime , his cool , ironic british humor cast-off attitude setting off ingrid smiling charms excellent balance , though most charming aspect grant performances he always manages look buffoon , somehow , yet still completely tangible audience . when we find out he lied his married hurt ingrid , we really should sympathizing ingrid over whole affair . yet when he dancing madly around inrgrid dance later , not knowing she aware his secret , he still grins broadly , if knowledge he , always , entertaining completely charming , we can't help but still adore him tha t.t he only thing i found tad daunting this movie camera work , some longer scenes . beginning , you given full view apartment where two lovers meet , granted , it lovely apartment . but after 5 minutes , you really begin wish camera would zoom , or refocus , or something , least , could hold your interest . looking same people same , pulled-out view longer amount time than comfortable really annoying , which shame , because it detracted severely actors ' performances . i really expected more donen , after seeing his work " singin ' rain . " but , then again , " singin ' rain " gene kelly co-director -- probably accounted difference . other than , it completely enjoyable film watch , i would recomment seeing it . dvd superb transfer , color sound really pop out , really showcases ingrid cary their very best	1
people like me who lived through fall berlin wall ( 1989 ) but little too young time paying much attention like this blast past . much wit summed up one scenes ( which only seen deleted scenes ) when lead character friend mentions his situation little like delicate situation " back future " ( big hit just reaching eastern bloc time movie set ) . tale revolves around boy who keep past alive sake his mother health it illustrates both excitement those who experienced west first time betrayal ( this case felt his mother ) those who upheld former regime . it clever look social change general bit history hasn't yet seen often film . i loved it	1

i've fan this series many years , i still believe this one best franchise , even though jason no where found except end cameo . i fully believe shock who killer goes book one best twists movie history , such what learned star wars movies . movie itself really well , but musical score takes it level adds so much more horror it . you can't hear song night not little scared , it one those songs puts chill bones when it heard . first person view camera takes it sees through eyes murderer really well , so death scenes . overall , this movie just doesn't get old not matter how many times i watch it	1
if mind-bending thrillers like basic instinct prove anything , theme expert becoming obsessed his cryptic subject presents great deal potential . this film attempts similar tapestry . our protagonist ( ewan mcgregor ) finds himself progressively involved eavesdropping disturbing femme fatale across street ( ashley judd ) who blackwidow-spider type habit zapping all males she beds . problem , nothing much happens this premise . we never find ourselves feeling agent or his liege . no romantic overtures dangerous undertones . no edge seat interactions ala sharon stone films early 90s . instead , there queer apparition agent daughter punctuates every second scene adds pile threads end up nowhere . such constant failure take advantage its almost-intriguing buildups gets film my generous 1-star rating , anyone but mcgregor biographer needn't bother	-1
many people noted , early summer ( or bakushu , made 1951 ) easy confuse movie ozu made during same period : late spring ( 1949 ) . aside references seasons title , both deal " problem " setsuko hara character ( she ever wonderful smile ) still unmarried her late twenties .

alright , i'll confess slight infatuation jet li , but even not make this movie more than passable . plot all over place . it barely made sense - characters would suddenly arrive , locations would develop then nothing would come them . bad guys just silly - i like real malice evil my badies , i like hate them enjoy their come uppance . well silly twisted bad boy just pathetic , jet li , ever serene , so far above whole mess , so detached lovely , just going through very routine job jet li . evil imperialist yankees plotting capture unsuspecting chinese immigrants enslave them cartoon cuts outs . like every other enthusiast this genre i enjoy carefully choreographed fights they good , but not good enough redeem this film . give me kung fu hustle any time - now there quality	1

i know i'm going minority , but i really appreciated jo van fleet performance above all . i liked high standard biblical preaching father , confused unloved competing youth james dean , very confident rival brother , his personality plus girlfriend , but me jo van fleet stole show . i can't help it ! her exquisite dominance character portrayal , far distant serious mother , gave me reason relish . i happen like strong women movies , i don't know why . she begins total mystery , dark woman walking alone herself , making huge sums money deposits town bank . she gets followed stranger who turns out her lost son days gone . they reunite , his intrusion , they get know each other she finds he dilemma . get know each other scene her small " office " makes me big believer top notch acting leave one breathless , without technical effects . it well filmed scene leaves two pros what they best-act ! her trail actions like lighting cigarette , reaching ink pen , slightly fisting herself forehead , dozing off alone late night her office chair , make her one most noteable cinematic female characters since judith anderson mrs. danvers alfred hitchcock rebecca . timeless piece work live forever movie history . way , i read one comment jo van fleet appearance actually minimal , but then margaret hamilton supposedly only 12 full minutes screen time wicked witch west . quality , not quantity . .	1

i loved this film , characters , setting , what spoken , what left unsaid . talk wrong place send 5 women ( nuns ) who repressing their sexuality ... women palace . it not constant winds haunts these women , but their desires , their regrets , memories this palace housed concubines harem many years ago . women who nothing think but sex , waiting one man come fulfill them , compete amongst themselves his attention . thing pained them most their forced celibacy endless days tedium ennui , sentiments soaked those walls , so many years later all these women experience same longing desires . erotic , most certainly , but haunting ghost story first caliber	1
like lot people , i remember this movie fondly when i younger , this movie still really fun . unlike remakes made now , this took classic film put its own twist story . acting good , but what really stands out me sets costumes , especially when they make it city . entire scene when they watching people sing green , red gold really cool watch . songs also very memorable really catchy . overall , this cool movie still enjoyed anyone , it really classic .	1
panned patronized time it initial release , elia kazan adaptation his best selling book arrangement plays much better now than it 1969 . made after 6 year hiatus filmmaking time when movies enjoying unheard freedom due demise production code , arrangement clearly shows kazan still director reckoned . basic premise nothing new . highly succesful businessman ( kirk douglas ) suffers mid-life crisis attempts suicide . how he other characters deal aftermath make up rest story . kazan always actor director film provides showcase young faye dunaway douglas ' mistress who gets him reexamine his life but wants out someone else . deborah kerr her last major film appearance superb difficult role wife who tries understand what douglas going through but doesn't want give up rich lifestyle she become accustomed . strong support given hume cronyn family solicitor who plans his own richard boone rare non-western role douglas ' ailing father . his slide into dementia both heartbreaking terrifying . marlon brando originally agreed play lead but bowed out allowing kirk douglas who really wanted work kazan step . while not stage trained like other principals , he acquits himself well emotionally opposed physically demanding role . combination raw emotions , alternating points-of-view including black humor , touches surrealism ambitious then still today ( think american beauty ) . movie not without its flaws . it runs too long occasionally sloppy everything editing make-up but powerful writing intense performances make arrangement provocative filmmaking nearly 40 years later . called everything harrowing emotional ride self-indulgent mess ( see amazon summary ) it ultimately home viewer decide ( my 4 star rating indicates where i stand ) . kazan always controversial figure because his huac testimony 1950 but his greatness director cannot denied remains captured film all see	1

evita movie version popular broadway musical same title . it tells true story eva duarte peron , wife famous president argentina juan peron . story starts when eva 15 , ends when she tragically dies cancer age 33 . story stars super-stars madonna , who plays eva , antonio banderas , who narrates story character named che . jonathan pyrce plays eva husband , juan peron . this movie very moving make you cry laugh . most it singing , songs they sing catchy fun sing . madonna singer very good actor , while antonio banderas proved his acting already , but now surprises us his singing voice . this movie excellent movie . it beautifully shot never got recognition it deserves . this movie you not soon forget	1

" andrei rublev " tarkovski illuminates era which great faith great brutality coexist side side . one hand you see this world great christian artists , who live their work . other hand , you see world invaders . remember scene where invaders lock entire village church ? torture scenes not very grafic , but implications make you sick your stomach . some point they invaders pour melted metal into mouth one their victims , silence his prayers , then put sack over his head drag him outside , tied horse . these two world world pagans . they cast suspended two universes . they russians but not christians . they echo heathen russia . tarkovsky shows ortohdox russians treat their heathen breathren same brutality they themselves treated invaders .	1

watched this film three times since 1996 , i keep revisiting it hoping maybe something me would change make me like this film more , but it hasn't!!!when movie wins nine academy awards i think , maybe " intelligentia " knows better . they don't!!!this film positively plodding . acting or screenplay not anything exceptional any way . ( no small wonder fiennes scot t-t homas beat out ! )i am person who usually moved what i see , but more i view this picture , more i realize why seinfeld show dedicated whole episode their hate this movie . when i revisit nominees 1996 i see what weak field this film up against , but certainly fargo , shine , secrets lies even jerry maguire more compelling than this 3-hour bore . each his/her own . you either love it or hate it . i preferred latter vehemently	-1

29th street sweet movie great watch during holidays since so much it set christmas time it nice message . if it wasn't very raw language this could almost family film but then if language cleaned up it would not realistic story this man his life . this one handful movies where real life hero plays smaller part film ( this case frank plays his policeman brother ) . characters argue , curse shout but their love each other shines through painting endearing picture blue collar new yorkers 1970 . film deserves more well known than it	1

this movie my all-time favorite when i little . robin hood definitely my all-time favorite disney character . i remember how i'd sit kitchen table draw countless pictures robin hood , how i'd sit front our family computer write stories involving robin hood . today , i other disney favorites , but i still love robin hood . i still watch movie time time . i'm hoping they'll release 2-disc special edition fairly soon . robin hood makes dashing outlaw , i love his oversized sidekick little john . villain , prince john , seems more comical than intimidating . i love scene where he cries his " mommy " sucks his thumb while holding his ear same time . seems like childish thing royal prince , don't you agree ? if you don't this movie , then go purchase copy it , or least rent it movie store . you won't disappointed .	1

no this isn't courtney friends , but once you get past - this must watch tv ! while show content shocking , it so well written edited it all fits . it definitely sequential drama makes much more sense watching episodes back back . fleshes out characters so you start care understand them . courtney shows her acting chops best those moments when she silent lets her expressions say it all because sometimes her dialog bit stilted . best character functional schizophrenic photographer , don konkey . he exhibits endearing combination weirdness , loyalty , insight sweetness become break-out star this series . if you only watched one episode wrote this one off - go back watch few back back you may just find yourself addicted .	1

" screamers " based short story " second variety , " late , great author philip . dick . same author who brought us " androids dream electric sheep , " aka " blade runner " " we remember it you wholesale " aka " total recall " more recently fine film " scanner darkly . " although film itself without doubt low budget film , movie itself still entertaining . this sci-fi film takes place year 2078 . it time continual warfare , both miners who refuse mine anymore due radiation , corporations who control future military , political , economic base . enter colonel joe hendricksson ( peter weller ) . he charge small group survivors still fighting war he himself sick . planet sirius 6b also host new fighting element : screamers . screamers mechanical machines kill anything moving surface . atrocious casualties both sides thinning ranks what once thriving colony , machines created help continue fight . only these machines evolved . like their human counterparts battle , they learned kill more efficiently : even creating newer more advanced killer-screamers . when spaceship crashlands sirius 6b , one survivor informs colonel hendricksson some disturbing news . reports so-called cease-fire promised lie . news reports sent back past 2 years fabricated . moreover , he now believes war senseless never end . therefore , he sets out make contact other commander enemy forces make peace ; since leaders back earth won't , he decides end war . this film very good low budget film . performance peter weller disillusioned commmander colonel hendricksson , stands up very well film . ' screamers ' they razor-sharp , fast moving machines cut down anything or anybody moving . although film would better if more money allocated into it production , it still very good film overall . i highly recommend film , it entertaining worth watch .	1

this not only my favorite western , but it also one my favorite films . i don't buy lot videos own , but i this one my permanent library . when dvd comes out i'll sure get it , too . when i first saw this theaters ' 72 i attracted action , humor , sentimentality ( i still can't keep dry eye when i watch final scene watch bear .... ) i got older i realised there lot more this movie . there consistent theme law justice , distinction them . when we first see roy bean he petty outlaw , less than man . he total contempt law justice , which he doesn't distinguish . then , when he first becomes " judge " , it dubious title only- fill his own pockets . time goes he intuitively dispenses true justice name law . final climactic scene , when asked who he , he replies simply , " justice . " he gone full cycle , scoff-law less than man , embodyment justice itself , more than man . you'll notice his chief adversary lawyer gass , man knows everything law nothing justice . " man " steals more legal trickery than old outlaws ever dreamed stealing . it this movie made me see law creation men , while justice ideal emanates directly god . i don't know if this theme john huston mind , but it what i get out it	1

original " candidate " masterpiece , awfully creepy film , considering subject matter . i personally would not watch original first then this ; i'd it other way around . this film loosely takes idea first one replaces communism scare corporate conspiracy . oh , it still works just fine , but only few scenes i find myself comparing it back original one . meryl streep absolutely chews scenery this film , playing combination hillary/coulter/matalin hybrid who suffocates her son ( sacrifices him , literally ) because her political " true believer " status . her tirade directly fellow party members who initially reject making her son vp nominee classic . it reminded me alec baldwin chewing up his five minutes " glengarry glen ross . " most fun movie watching liev schreiber start unravel he realizes what they remember gulf war not what it seemed , early scene where fellow vet confronts denzel character after rah-rah speech boy scouts his kuwait exploits . they don't waste much time here before letting you know something really wrong . jonathan demme directs he uses his " silence lambs " technique extreme facial closeups great , disorienting effect . it pretty freaky , quite often . they update original " trigger " isn't visual one but verbal one , which i thought nice touch . repeated viewings , you'll catch some things you didn't notice before going background some " i just see ...? " cameos , most notably one only robyn hitchcock . i swear , one scene background , guy who either or really looks like barry white playing security agent . one last highlight completely over-the-top " convention " climax , when two candidates come out face crowd . " theatricality " over-the-top absurdity it all ( new mt . rushmore ?! ) probably seemed ridiculously funny few years ago , but would probably irony-free these days . oh yeah , you'll never look cup o ' noodles same again after this . this movie isn't just thriller elements modern mk-ultra conspiracy but also commentary our current political system , whereas original dealt more freaky thought communist sleeper agents our midst . highly recommended . hey , it demme after all--it hard go wrong this . if you liked final explanation/twist what happened ' nam " jacob ladder , " this right up your alley	1

nearly all movies made kurt vonnegut books simply awful ( happy birthday wanda june , mother night , breakfest champions ) . there one delightful exception -- slaughterhouse five . makers this film took time trouble make their movie subtle . they accepted fact vonnegut never appealed loud , over-stimulated , self-absorbed , resource-guzzling masses . kurt books appeal directly depressed , quiet , suffering young men women who still school still think deeply life . hero , billy pilgrim , pretty much carried events happening around him . he finally sees insanity trying take charge his own life learns simply accept things way they . this essentially taoist tale . most stories told vonnegut taoist perspective . hero dropped into middle meat grinder life told repeatedly he must not allow himself turned into hamburger . but , contrary his most feverish guilt-ridden efforts , he turned into hamburger . when he finally accepts reality lump hamburger , life becomes little easier him deal .	1

after living this film 15 years , it seems me best description its theme comes words character liz ( jane birkin ) , who context speaking work her husband , painter frenhofer . according her , it concerns something " shameful--it not body shameful , not nudity , but something else . . . " " something else " violation , existentially speaking , enigma painter model . such violation cannot seen without mediation art . cinematic context , it risk direction takes whenever it approaches its subject frontally , we see rivette tendency retreat wide shots , place events off-screen , or circle behind his players . this critique bresson , who insisted calling his players " models " rather than " actors ? " ( it impossible not recall storied psychological scars bresson methods allegedly left his players . ) it clearly not simple , there close-ups noiseuse seem cruel actors frenhofer his model . this goes beyond bresson other ways : rivette , always reader , patched together thumping good story literary sources ranging poe balzac james , process created true mystery thriller . mystery hinges four-minute shots hand scratching out drawing makes it no less thrilling . it tumbles forward toward profoundly ironic ending worthy best james novels . initial critical take this film it most thorough document artistic process ever committed film . well , yes no . it seems artistic process painter , but i think there may playful game " bait-and-switch " afoot . watch b�art . watch , especially , piccoli , who veritable encyclopedia actor art , mesmerizing his scudding , absent-minded movements he his sudden precision , always surprising . rivette devotion actors clear all his films : think his sets , so resembling stages their creaky boards , sound " effect " rivette more often than not takes place score . it may artist canvas , plaster , stone , or screen may reveal something secret , even shameful , his models . it may even unscrupulous artist thief soul . but rivette , one , shows la belle noiseuse he given these things some serious thought . he always generous his actors . result trust artist model demonstrated this film amounts strong rebuke idea film cannot show thought . it ; it comes price , but hands master it great gift players it audience	1

official story excellent example how mix political cinema human drama , avoiding agitprop or crude sloganeering put human face issue argentina disappeared - particular children taken away undesirables given well-connected families who won't ask any questions . when one well-heeled adopted mother learns this begins suspect her adopted daughter may one those children , rather than turn into sermon film focuses her own fears she tries disprove possibility until ultimately she same uncertain hell families disappeared - she suspect , but she never truly know . although some devices may seem little too schematic - she history teacher who depends solely `verifiable ' official version her country history - it wears them lightly often extremely powerful . best foreign film oscar rather dubious history , but this definitely one more deserving winners	1

first all , i would like start off saying this movie sucks . here few things supports my decision . 1 . dacascos not know capoeira . he played berimbau ( insrument used capoeira ) wrong , he pronouced many terms incorrectly , he no flow his movements . 2 . acting horrible . while watching this , you kind get picture director wanted finish this movie soon possible . most lines just stupid . dacascos character no real history . apparently this mysterious past you really could care less because plot so predictable . 3 . fighting laughable best . capoeira only martial art outlawed so violent unstoppable . you don't need corny fight scenes show it usefulness . most fight scenes where repeated movements shot different angles . dacascos doing meia lua ( spinning kick which both hands ground you strike ) knocking out three people once . one ridiculous scene , saverio ( drug lord ) pointed where he wanted dacascos stand so he could miraculously appear behind him perform unchallenged jumping kick back his head . i wish experinced capoeirista would fight scenes . although this movie horrible , it only movie which capoeira suppose main artform used . while watching this movie , one only hope this poor performance dosen't hurt capoeira chances cornerstone movie .	1

we should start making one thing clear : films zalman king no basis reality whatsoever ; they're erotic fantasies , pure simple . how else explain his casting choices leading roles his films : carrie otis , sherilyn fenn , david duchovony , richard tyson , bridgette bako , etc . people real life seldom sex appeal above-mentioned names . then there stories cloak these fine specimens , which almost always involve young innocent woman led down road sexual discovery , usually domineering though charming man , who she secretly lusted after sometime . what king films lack dramatic verve , they make up hitting their intended target : your libido . critics pounced like never before his feature film adaptation anais ninn erotic classic , ' delta venus . ' but they clearly missed point , ' delta venus ' isn't so much feature film , it most epic , most visually beautiful episode king 90s showtime series , ' red shoe diaries . ' context , it succeeds its fairly modest goals . set 1940s paris , ' venus ' introduces us aspiring writer named elena ( audie england ) . what appears morning ritual , she rushes banks sienne bitter january cold , muted urgency , one thing : watch handsome lawrence ( costas mandylor) -- man she yet meet --- row through foggy river . it isn't too long before she meets lawrence party thrown her agent , marcel ( eric da silva ) , discovers lawrence also writer , thriving , if controversial career . he , fact , leave france american tour support his latest effort --- but not before whirlwind affair elena , which far more profound effect her than she could ever imagined . lawrence gone , no money , no luck getting her stories published , elena crew friends --- artist , singer , their same-sex lovers --- suggest elena model nude cash . but marcel got more lucrative idea : she could write explict sex stories nameless collector erotica , who'll pay her handsomely it . ulitmately , elena accepts both offers , when collector , through marcel , insists graphic realism her stories , she ups ante her own sex life , fullfilling her desperate " desire plunge into living " " capable many loves . " audie england performance elena unfairly panned . she isn't great actress , but she just right mix doe-eyed innocence , restless intelligence , raw sensuality bubbling just beneath surface make her believeable . her initial scenes mandylor mildly touching , we see her teeter school-girl crush burning womanly desire . if nothing else , she least marked improvement over woozy carrie otis ' wild orchid . ' take how you may . costas mandylor really isn't this movie much , but he makes most what there . two chemistry , without which ' delta venus ' would really terrible critics said . granted , king doesn't always hit mark ' delta'--a sequence set party st. tropez particularly irritating his reach themes seem overextend his grasp . there definitely points which dialogue seem strain capture nin prose . critics also complained this film simply doesn't reflect reality life 1940s france . ( ugh . ) but counter , go back top this review read first sentence again . you really expecting zalman king give you blow-by-blow hitler invasion france ? if you're going this simply watch interesting love story -- turned beautiful cinematography , gorgeous actors , atmospheric lushness -- you not disappointed . fans tv show ' lost ' fans get kick out cameo made adewale akinnoyue-agbaje mysterious clairvoyant who gives ... special reading redheaded prostitute	1

i skeptical this film expected disappointed , but contrary , i pleasantly surprised . essential thing remember this maurice pialat * vision * van gogh , not documentary . taken spirit , there much here vincent fans enjoy . those unfamiliar van gogh life work likely lost ( probably bored ) , but those who familiar vincent his oeuvre appreciate research pialat put into this film artistic choices he made . i also encourage viewers who may felt they missed something first time watch it second time , because there many small things best noticed second time round . one detail i particularly appreciated replication van gogh actual room auberge ravoux auvers-sur-oise this film ( not case " lust life " or " vincent theo " ) ; those who visited auberge moved their experience -- like myself -- feel surge recognition first time humble little room appears onscreen . course there some major inaccuracies/speculations pialat uses fuel drama . most obvious central love affair film ( marguerite gachet ) , which pialat invention most implausible number reasons . but it serves its purpose context film . i not get impression ( one reviewer below ) affair presented motive suicide--it not . suicide affair both result larger malaise . jacques dutronc simply extraordinary vincent , his acting filled subtlety . he doesn't stoop histrionics or scenery-chewing ... he doesn't need . every gesture , every facial expression , every look his eyes says something character . no wonder he won cesar role . this neither vincent " lust life " ( kirk douglas ' tormented soul searching love understanding ) nor vincent " vincent theo " ( tim roth mad-as-a-hatter egoist ) . this vincent quiet cup coffee before he goes work morning escapes dr. gachet house enjoy solitary lunch wheatfields ( latter one my favorite moments film -- simple but lyrical ) . there no sign " mad artist " van gogh mythology . suicide comes much surprise film it must real life . we don't see it coming . apparently there region 2 dvd available uk deleted scenes bonus materials . i wish it available region 1 dvd us !	1
i really like this film . first all it absolutely beautiful look . tahoe water water everywhere - all sumptuously photographed . story emotionally intense rollercoaster lengths mother go protect her children . intense , often suspensful sometimes creepy , this keeper . swinton amazing here - like one raw jangling nerve . she amazing watch . rest cast fine their roles , whether shady , clueless or sympathetic . well worth view	1
i cannot believe all negative reviewers . obviously you never adult party where people behave like teenagers after delt alcohol mixed drug nobody ever tried before their age . least not here . but i similar party , it ended similarly . fights happen , but not serious . you take things happen party open mindedness or not them . your husband or wife or girlfriend ... etc ., not going behave usual you see bad side them . if relationship can't handle one party like this one , it probably can't survive marriage . story kept me interested almost whole way through except female gossip got alittle boring , otherwise very watchable , funny tragic . i would like see it again	1

so fireman ball gentle look human comedy or it sly subversive poke nose inept , authoritarian government ? perhaps we should take word director milos forman . it just gentle comedy , he'd shrug his native czechoslovakia after picture released 1967 . course it subversive , he'd say , after he'd flee his country 1968 , when soviet tanks sent install tougher , duller brand communist leaders snuff out brief prague spring . how subversive ? new czech leadership immediately banned movie " permanently forever . " all this , it still one sweetest , most good-natured looks how people behave , even their leaders , who undoubtedly among most bumbling , self-serving incompetent group men you'd ever hope not meet . small czechoslovakian town leadership fire department planning ball raffle honor their aged former chief . they'd planned year before his 85th birthday but , well , they never quite got around it . now he dying cancer they feel they really ought something . there great banner meeting hall , dance drinks food , beauty contest featuring town young women , great raffle donated delicacies , bottles wine toys cosmetics . but , oh . one thing after happens sweet irony , banner burns . girls don't want take part . slowly , item item , things begin go missing raffle table ... first chocolate cake , then bottle cognac , head cheese , chocolate ball . " every one stealing here , " wife one blustering fireman tells him ., " you only watch , you old honest idiot ! " she one stolen headcheese her bag . firemen entertainment committee , group puffed-up aging men , dither bicker endlessly over details problems . " busts ... busts important " one thing they all agree they examine candidates beauty contest . one point head firemen committee stops music tells crowd some items taken raffle table . he says lights go out few minutes he expects items returned . lights go off . lights come back . even more items table missing . it all looks like ball eventually end shambles , but then they hear alarm . farm house fire nearby . firemen townsfolk rush fire manage rescue aged farmer his underwear . but fire engine stuck snow . there no water pressure . farm house burns down ground . but least firemen find way comfort cold , old man . while he watches his possessions burn , they suggest he move his chair closer fire keep warm . this such wry gentle comedy , so sweet-natured , it reassuring realize leaden hand czech authoritarianism now long gone , this movie remains all us . this criterion presentation looks sounds just fine . there excellent interview milos forman	1

formula familiar but enjoyable . group british tough guys assembled enterprise combines violence humor , while cherishing their peculiar personalities even finding goodness where none should grow . we've prisoners winning gardening competition , pot dealers helping little old ladies , crooks leaving crime life real estate agents . now here " mean machine , " corrupt british soccer champion , jailed rigging important match , ordered prison governor coach inmates ' team . big match against guards ' team . if this premise rings faint , far-off bell , you may remembering robert aldrich " longest yard " ( 1974 ) , one burt reynolds ' best performances , told same story , more or less , terms american football . barry skolnick " mean machine " more than inspired " longest yard ; " it based same tracy keenan wynn screenplay , indeed " mean machine " even original title " longest yard .

when i found this movie video store i little nervous but after fifteen minutes into it i really started enjoy it . yes , it most definitely guy movie there some vulgar bathroom humor . but , acting theme make this worthwhile rental . i really wish this movie longer because near end when you really feel chemistry d'onofrio hines . they really get comfortable one i wanted more . last thirty minutes movie absolutly terrific because it just really picks up once they get gold city . plus , audience gets better indepth perception olee(especially ) lemely . i think vincent d'onofrio good job playing blind man . unlike some actors he makes it believable throughout he cannot see(it very natural it like he not acting , way it should ) . rent this movie it good i mean it only made like 40,000 $ theater these small films need our support plus how you not respect actor who multimillion dollar film(men black ) then tiny film like this one same year . also , i would like add i am quite jealous guy who wrote review he movie . i mean pretty cool it pretty hard top ! hey i emailed littlejake4@ivillage.com if you like film or not	1

forewarned those who may driving desert night some dark , deserted piece highway . stop hitchhikers your own risk . also avoid urge trying too helpful fellow motorist stranded way . remember things not always what they appear . this quite well-constructed , coherent storyline beginning end . you never left dark this plot . everything explained appropriate time , history this particular vampire sect , how they happened show up midwest america , how vampire virius works body , its telepathic properties what must cure yourself curse " forsaken . " all this infomation nicely worked into script such way not bog down viewer too much substance , hence detracting what average movie fan looking , gore violence . brief comment any young girls who may get struck watching this boyfriend . while you may not enjoy horror elements movie you might enjoy male members cast which includes ; brendan fehr ( roswell ) , kerr smith ( dawson creek , final destination ) johnathon schaech ( thing you ) head vampire . brendan fehr terrific young , wise beyond his years vampire hunter roaming highways byways search vampire infected him virius . my favorite scene movie when nick ( brendan fehr ) sean ( kerr smith ) stop roadside diner bite eat . two-way conversation quickly turns into monologue when nick begins compare aspirations hopes his generation those last . it not only hilarious , but absolutely true . without giving away too much ending , i'll just say perfect opening provided sequel . while i'm not generally fan sequels , i would've liked see brendan fehr reprise his role vampire hunter least one more time . simply most enjoyable vampire film since " lost boys .

i love this movie . i only few comments some scenes within . first , why cia doing surveillance american airport retired colonel his mercenary crew going pow/mia mission ? cia not chartered domestic surveillance . second , boat scene , after crew loaded its gear it , fails show mr. chang two daughters . it showed all other members but not girls - where they ? third , scene where patrick swayze fires thehill-top down onto lao guards , mr. chang shot head . whom ? unless sharpshooter hiding nearby , it would nearly impossible infantryman shoot upward his target hit him forehead , especially " fog war " occuring through most scene . comments aside , movie inspiring brings tears my eyes due fact handful guys balls go back southeast asia retrieve our pows/mias whereas government failed so . acting may melodramatic , but storyline right	1

one first best musicals , anchors aweigh features several memorable musical sequences , such kelly dancing jerry mouse , kelly dancing 7-year-old sharon mcmanus , sinatra singing jose iturbi playing piano , kathryn grayson singing iturbi conducting , much more . technicolor perfect , some innovative camera work such seeing piano played beneath , through transparent keys , grayson singing , seen through finder camera . plot thin , but you get involved kelly sinatra enthusiasm . sailor leave , they take home runaway boy ( dean stockwell ) sinatra falls his aunt . set him up aunt ( grayson ) , kelly suggests sinatra get her audition jose iturbi . but sinatra young naive this one , , his own sung words , falls love too fast . while they're trying contact iturbi , who never available , he starts fall girl ( barbara britton ); but kelly now falling love grayson . anchors aweigh most often remembered combination live-action / cartoon sequence tom jerry , but there lot more here that worth look . i'm giving it five stars because , while it not quite good best musicals - singin ' rain , music man , oklahoma - it one first their class technicolor big productions ( perhaps meet me st. louis first ) , better than most others .	1
i understand why people prefer videos like live sunset strip , but what those people fail see this one rawest , most heart-wrenching stand-up performances ever put film . start finish , pryor laying himself bare--i'd give this video four stars his boldness alone -- completely honest moment , without care whether audience " " him or not . several times they clearly not -- you sense tension room when he chastises walk-out admits homosexual experiences . it monologue where pryor transforms himself into " willy junkie , " however , makes this video must anyone interested art stand-up comedy . it masterpiece audience manipulation -- first , it seems like harmless , amusing caracature , but soon it morphs into horrifyingly honest portrayl . i dare anyone watch this not strong reaction some sort ( it me tears ) . granted , it isn't funny ( who says stand-up funny all times ? ) , but it shows what pryor best : exploring area most people spend their whole lives trying avoid -- rock bottom .	1

after watching " new jack city " , " sugar hill " definitely similar , but milder , pared down version former , still stark realities street life drug trade common denominator . while new jack , wesley snipes character " nino " cold , bloodthirsty , womanizing , heartless druglord . snipes ' role carmello sh much more conservative terms his mannerisims , attire , he compassionate , humane , sympathetic , but still not forgetting he first foremost drug kingpin who needs take care business . ironically , carmello must care his ailing father , whose life shambles result abusing same product made his own son rich , eventually succumbs . i would even go limb say nino njc could regarded re-incarnated life this film character(carmello ) . carmello eventually tires his life dealer , realizes there more life than jet set lifestyle , wealth material things . eventually , carmello given chance redemption , but must live rest his life crippling injury inflicted his own brother , who eventually dies well . carmello starts over far concrete jungles nyc new wife child . remarkable clarence williams , ernie hudson , vondie curtis-hall , lovely theresa randle , abe vigoda other actors add depth this film . even after 10 years , this movie still hits home	1

you more neurons firing your frontal lobe than average 14 year old this one . some called this " mockumentary " , but term oversimplifies film . this love story . it not " boy loves girl , loses girl , then gets girl back " . it " boy loves himself until he meets girl ( " hattie " - " sweet " one ) he unwittingly loves more than himself , dumps her , gets girl ( " blanch " - " lowdown " one ) , marries then divorces her , only then realizes how much he loved hattie ... then just fades away ... without her . " just like real life , there many hilarious moments shared intertwining souls wide ranging idiosyncrasies , but just like real life , true love infinite then gone instant . this why film presented documentary - " true story " . characters , time , place all arbitrary meant entertain you while delivering classic tale love unappreciated then lost forever . sometimes there isn't " hollywood ending " love story .	1
i thought supernatural would just sci-fi thriller , but then i started watching it surprised discover there real plot line character development . i think this show wonderful would recommend it everyone	1
spoiler alert : it rather hard review this film without giving away some key components . i don't normally include so-call " spoilers " my reviews , but this case it lot themes film . this film came out during glorious era spiritual horror flicks like " exorcist " " omen , " because great success those films , this humdinger sadly overlooked . this truly horrifying film deserves place your dvd collection , especially if you into this specific genre spiritual horror flicks . cast impressive list actors who , unfortunately , has-beens 70 , or up coming actors who now rather famous . christina raines , main actress , sadly , never made it big she should she gives very solid performance rather difficult disturbing film . i found other actors good , but bit hammy times , but doesn't detract overall impression film . fact , it may , bizarre way , add it considering casting actual freaks , forgive political incorrectness term , film . this film like freak show sorts or car accident itself . we don't really want see what screen , but we can't help ourselves . there enough this film revolt some infuriate many , especially it condemnation " sins man " we try accept today our over indulgence term " tolerance . " when one sees this odd film , one must keep mind it based catholic faith interpretation sin , certainly instution not well-known it tolerance any sin . so if you inclined whatever feels good your life , especially point excess , you may find yourself squirming your seat bit while watching this film either out awkward sense guilt seeing your sins kind exposed this film , or anger your way life isn't considered " acceptable " staunch religious . no one likes someone pointing condemning finger him or her , even when it may earned . our natural instinct either feel shame or anger or even mixture both . way , i mean " freak show " literally when i mentioned it earlier . i don't care term myself , but those film considered themselves such i grew up time location no problem term , so please excuse my use it here i honestly don't mean rude . there less make-up involved this film than most aware actual circus freaks used film , especially climax scene . fact , my dad knew number them they part freak show coney island , famous amusement park south brooklyn where i spent many summer day riding cyclone roller coaster . occasion my dad would take me some bizarre shows park it interesting then see those shows film later able say " i know guy ! " me , young age when seeing it , it added oddity film . my parents obviously far too permissive films they let me see when i young . i saw this film when it came out " exorcist " " omen " i barely my teens then . anyhow , i grew up bensonhurst not too far where they filmed this movie i recall taking pictures actual house where they filmed exterior shots ; i unfortunately lost them over years . house neighborhood very congested red hook section brooklyn , despite directly across river bustling manhattan overcrowded section brooklyn , there intense feeling isolation conveyed film . much credit this goes director , michael winner , achieving this via camera positioning . course , he experienced shooting new york directed brilliant " death wish " charles bronson earlier . whole concept film bit silly but weirdly interesting lone priest guards gates hell until he passes guardianship over someone else before his death . if he unable so , then gates hell remain open they temporarily left ajar during transition one " sentinel " next . idea satan , played burgess meredith , comes up keep hell gates open open wide convince new sentinel commit suicide , mortal sin catholic church something main character attempted once before her life , instead accepting thankless life isolation servitude means redemption past sins . silly premise film , one can't help but feel both uplifted end sad new sentinel her sacrifice made behalf thankless strangers . analogy christ crucifixation life priest/nunhood clear here notion how sinful , ugly , sadly self-centered suicide viewed catholic church many outside it . please spare me negative comebacks this isn't my personal view suicide . i tend feel god takes great pity those who not face trials life often brings those who attempt or succeed suicide often distraught not thinking clearly . i trouble believing god would punish such troubled soul , but discussion ( argument ? ) . like " exorcist " " omen " before it , we sadden losses sustained sacrifices made end main characher who may not totally noble but certainly likable . " sentinel " alison reluctantly takes role new guardian . she wanted so much out life already felt god owed her something , hence her suicide attempt earlier , yet , she still gives god others spite her past pain . one can't help see how she may offered redemption her past mistakes taking this burden , but she allowed free not accept it , but she although she may so begrudingly , she it salvation world . " exorcist " father karras not , misinterpreted some , commit suicide end , but rather sacrifices himself save regan , possessed girl ( he catches demon souls so-to-speak ) . " omen " peck character , mr. thorn , willing kill his only son save world . sound biblically familiar all ? these spiritual horror flicks popular reason still because we respect those willing sacrifice themselves selflessly others , even if they don't really want it . perhaps it because we may think ourselves incapable such action or would like believe we would take same road these heroes . it matters little end what your religious beliefs or if you any all . we just can't help moved one so noble nature , even if he or she reluctant so ( consider george bailey " it wonderful life " ) , giving all he or she our benefit . consider our love appreciation soldiers who fight us , police firemen who equally risk their lives us , complete strangers you get my drift . i always enjoyed these kinds spiritual horror films when they well-acted , written directed , they become classics . i am bit reluctant label this film " classic " , but it still excellent film holds up well . it didn't define genre like others i mentioned , but it certainly accomplishes what it set out . it frightens us appropriate times , grosses us out others ( it very graphic ) gets us see both worst best humankind . it may not true classic like " exorcist " or " omen " , but it certainly solid companion such films worth spot your shelf	1

c'mon now , fess up : you ever really believe john wayne cowboy ? or any other actors 30s , 40s 50s westerns ? their clean shirts , their white hats , their crisp scarves their middle-america ethics , they convincing harrison ford president united states . westerns times past what we wanted west , not what it . because real west wasn't pretty it wasn't romantic . it stank ! this movie i able believe western setting first time . altman mccabe mrs. miller ( novel edmund naughton ) not only deconstructs cliches -- lone hero standing up lots bad guys , hooker heart gold , town pulls together -- it suggests far more plausible realities how west won . altman town business its own survival . while , roger ebert points out , " everybody knows everybody , " long before picture started , there no team spirit here . each character mercenary , no one noble . that probably how it real west if you wanted survive past next tuesday . that probably why film focuses so much church--it little bastion relief after all hypocracy goes monday through saturday . early beatty mccabe says he trying get away " partners , " people coming into his life telling him what . one altman central points you cannot world mirrors organism , where many parts not single cell what determine survival . more even than fred schepisi excellent underrated barbarosa ( 1976 ) , this western anti-hero . or maybe non-hero . we sense mccabe not escape men who want his business interest first time they meet -- everyone seems figure out but him . mrs. miller also seems fleeing something--we're never sure what exactly -- but she appears out whole cloth looking mccabe says she " sent " look him , not really explaining anything explanation . her motivation hooking up him remains elusive me . she could better elsewhere . -- or maybe she just needed man boss around . rest cast what ensemble casts robert altman films : they advance director bird eye view his surroundings . quirky shelley duvall low-key john schuck , they inhabit brutal world , both emotionally physically . conditions harsh . everyone everything dirty . nights dark . comforts few , mostly found bottle intercourse , both social carnal . it any wonder these people care only themselves ? final message i took away mccabe mrs. miller . towns -- business empires , everything else -- founded tough people who persevere anything but romantic idealized symbols they become much later . west john ford , william wyler , tall cowboys god-fearin ' townsfolk , comforting . it disneyland vision how we came , higher purpose part mix . but whether it big corporations or big towns , their survival result violent actions , amoral choices pure survival instinct . it instinct mccabe , despite his own sort anti-hero , lacks , pays ultimate price . wal-mart comes town . that part american story too . we subscribe this myth america land rugged individualism , but fact america embodies collective corporate more probably than any other non-totalitarian country face earth . or maybe even counting totalitarian countries--it just different kind totalitarianism . freedom , altman tells us , myth , or least type freedom americans always hold theirs theirs uniquely . it not kind film leave you smile you walk out theater , but then , most robert altman movies aren't . way , this film antithesis wyler big country , which tells us there plenty everything everybody , everyone his piece . 1950s , seemed true enough . time we reached 1970s , however , world different place . film gorgeously shot one my favorite cinematographers , vilmos zsigmund . it cold beauty , but if you find poetry mud puddles cloudy skies , you impressed . ( this one few movies i've ever seen where rain actually * beautiful . *) extremely low-key lighting matches mood , makes us feel cut off rest world . ( i don't know why gordon willis got slammed so much godfather his lack light when this movie made year earlier every bit dark . ) leonard cohen songs perfect complement . their contemporary feel lyrics tell us western genre deconstructed , once all . some people , mccabe mrs. miller may not their cup tea . it film yields more after subsequent viewings . there not lot plot , few elements there still baffle me -- shooting one coyboy cold blood no apparent reason , example . film takes its time get point point , this post-star wars world may prove frustrating some . still , those who take their time it , mccabe mrs. miller beautiful poem west , both real one one exists solely our imaginations . print good , though not pristine . music track sounds fine , but sometimes dialogue murky hard understand -- even altman . supposedly he asked clean up some sound elements some reason refused . trailer , surprisingly , anamorphic . ( you won't care unless you hdtv . ) there not much extras , just altman commentary ( that pretty good once ) short tv behind-the-scenes documentary . i liked this film lo t--t o me it one those great " 70s sensibility " flicks like chinatown godfather network -- but i understand how it might acquired taste , especially today	1
characters likable , there some decent progression growth seen over course film , but only half scenes necessary . it seems if they just wanted give gene wilder few more chances quirky . gene funny guy , there no doubt , but enough enough ! film family friendly , except few instances harsh language violence , but it really nothing compared sorts things get into theaters these days . it worth look , but only if you're willing deal some pretty decent stretches time when there not lot progression story	1
this series just tad too much blood my taste ... it verges horror , here there , which bugs me ; i even like super-violent action movies just fine , but brutally slaughtered recent corpse thing ( more ' personalized ' violence than killing bad guys ) not my style . this why i gave it 4 instead 5 stars . aside detail , i find this show totally addictive . brothers make ' buddy movie ' effect , whole supernatural framework creates sort non-religious yet definitely spiritual effect ( big mystery why these guys never ever seen praying show ; i actually known people who lifestyle similar what show depicts , central ) . not mention young men so passionate , powerful , strong , yet sensitive , darkly troubled past , sheer sexy it nearly intoxicating over long run many episodes . ;-) anyway -- show actual plot , it well filmed intelligently well worth watching . i recommend it	1

i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1
storyline movie simple one : two soldiers captured people who live mountains . leader people mountains wants trade them his son , who prison . so leader tells two captured men write their mothers tell them come get them they make deal , so so forth . movie not one greatest movies i seen , but it not terrible piece . ending great completely unexpected . , i'm not sure if it just me , but plot character motivation seemed derived viewer common sense rather than any real motive movie . example older soldier kills sheep herder ; whole exchange seems like something out monty python . throughout movie there sense humor , me person i watched it laughing hysterically few scenes ( most notable when prisoners get drunk ) random times throughout . overall film gave off surrealist feel . it never quite seemed real all . exchanges characters just keep getting more more unrealistic ( i'm not sure if writer planned or not , but it seem lag near end ) . movie definitely loses points front . also there never seemed any real connection things . beginning threw me off , when they attacked them brought them back horses threw me off . it somewhat difficult get into movie , but once it got going it easier watch , then it drug then it over . not recipe success my eyes . although i'm not sure if way russian cinema , but certainly isn't way american cinema runs , least not kind deemed good quality . but overall i would recommend watching it , it good movie . but sure you're watching it someone else so you able laugh them share few raised eyebrows plot how doesn't seem realistic .	1

i'm absolutely stunned . i wouldn't surprised if every five or ten minutes words ' wow ' or ' oh my god ' came out my mouth . last half hour most phenomenal part movie me . i think i sat there my jaw hanging open whole time . it completely disturbing but , same time , amazing fascinating . there so much goes movie , but it all makes sense somehow ... yet , it all so utterly confusing . this film absolutely brilliant i believe this jeremy iron finest performance . i went into movie aware both twins played jeremy irons but middle movie characters no longer jeremy irons , they beverly elliot mantle , which what i believe acting supposed . i wouldn't say this my favorite movie , fact , i wouldn't even put it my top ten . but most intriguing amazing movies , best acted role , i would put this film right top . my recommendation you would rent this movie yourself stunned just like i . you may not want add it your permanent dvd collection , but this movie worth seeing least once .

wasn't this movie made cary grant most money , most successful grant film , one broke record consecutive weeks ny radio city music hall ? after recent re-viewing , i see why , although it hardly grant best . fact , i don't suppose it even approaches his top twenty . tony curtis , it different story . tony , signed most his studio career universal , didn't really get much chance develop his full potential , except oddities like some like it hot , vikings , spartacus , most his films pretty much dreck . ( think all classic directors whom janet leigh worked , then ask yourself how tony fail take advantage his status #1 usa leading man . ) but operation petticoat give you idea kinds things tony best , kudos young blake edwards writing him such good part page after page surefire comic situations stage business . script filmed ten years later , well , grant wouldn't it course , but i think times would allowed more full implications tony character sleazy promiscuity emerge ; here sexuality tamped bit submarine setting general radio city atmosphere . wasn't cary grant even least little bit annoyed playing script which he would basically old fuddy-duddy like james cagney mister roberts , tony playboy , signature cary grant role ? fact operation petticoat must trying some " everyman " service comedy mister roberts , it same febrile energy , his awkward introduction servicewomen other female stereotypes , something same drab fire ; i imagine women enter both films only suggest there wasn't any hanky-panky cary tony because no way could either them gay . dina merrill appropriately icy here , though she knows she not really welcome , she just there allay suspicion . i love her look , but she no grace kelly , that sure , human warmth far away her range working-class solidarity	1
this simply response latest review made " viewer " this film . i , quite simply , feel review level narrow-mindedness film recommend not basing your choice their review . state " world favor get rid them " well saying these criminals " irredeemable beyond any rehabilitation " very prejudiced . lack restorative justice inability find effective deterrent not necessarily fault people who commit criminal acts , but state . before saying you wish cop there " take care hustlers muggers prey upon innocent visitors ( otherwise beautiful ) places like montego bay negril " you should try question why these muggers hustlers even exist . could it because travler presence itself ? anyway , i not believe you justify killing criminals satisfy your own traveling enjoyment . it reasons such this people who lead path criminality not get appropriate attention rehabilitation . try questioning methods state not ' hopelessness ' criminals . i recommend this movie , it a+ . just not watch it mindset this last reviewer quite narrowly insists .	1

i think , perhaps , people want make this movie more complicated study " truth " than it . fact , it tells simple story involving simple truth : we some base instincts motivations which cannot always denied societal mores . film not pleasing those who want see more " character development " same reason " bridges madison county " panned - point movie not who characters why they became who they became . point , two similar spirits met , mingled , moment , loosed themselves artificial restraint . relationship two main characters this film no chance developing into anything beyond lust rutting satisfaction lust . " damage " occurs because lusty rutting offends so many fundamental mores . situation two " lovers " develops it becomes less less human until it finally beyond any control - lust becomes addiction destructive worst kind drug addiction . it doesn't simply " spin " out control - destructive energy builds until it cannot contained . energy such it sucks its other , unaware point , victims into its vortex they all devoured - damage total destruction life it only short time before . film should prompt thoughts " artificial " restraints " normal " urges instincts . what wrong two people physically attracted doing things these people ? what wrong same kinds people who rolled together kitchen floor " bridges madison county ? " " love " require fidelity ? should we not - humans - all concerned emotional damage we cause ourselves those we love not restraining natural urge ? this movie train wreck opening scene . it something you might want look away - but just can't . it might disgust you but it also might thrill you . it reason people listen shock radio watch soap operas . it reason people say our society gone or going hell . it our base nature we like think we don't or , least , under control . it what happens when - if - we ignore our humanity give head our basest instincts . when you watch it , don't just watch it . let yourself go . then , end , wonder if it dream you'd enjoy reality or if you relieved it just dream . it phenomenal movie	1

okay , so we all know story how ducks come behind win how coach bombay gets revenge his old coach many years bad memories . fair enough . corny thin plot times , it still great story good morals . it definitely no hoosiers or rudy longshot , but it disney it best . it classic disney sports movie well great family film . now , dvd . let just say i sure didn't buy this movie special features . there menu screen chapter search that it . ohh , one more thing . whenever they re-released film dvd , i guess they must inserted queen " we champions " " we rock you " into portions film end credits . one thing particular kinda bugged me fact original score david newman replaced queen " we champions " right part where charlie scores winning penalty shot . it not queen song wouldn't fitting here . i just felt original score added lot emotion within film . not huge deal . i just didn't remember last time i saw movie vhs . ahh well . i guess $8 i really can't complain	1
man oh man . if you took time machine back 1972-3 you would nearly impossible time finding film quite disturbing its ultra-realistic portrayal needless violent brutality last house left . while it may true compared many 80 gore-fests today gore/horror films lhotl may seem little tame(not really though ) , it still packs quite wallop even 35 years after its release . fact , without lhotl we never would got i spit your grave , house edge park , night train murders , mother day , last house dead-end street , cannibal man , maniac , henry : portrait serial killer , man bites dog countless other examples modern horror realism filmaking . lhotl paved way horror films concerning simply , violence . it one first films truly represent depravity post-world war ii american society killers who helped define violence latter-20th century . when you combine this historical context , fact this classic film made near-amatuers low budget , it hard deny legend terrible allure last house left . put yourself mindset theatre-goer seeing film 1972 i defy you downplay this film power ! if you consider yourself true horror fanatic haven't yet seen this film , pick it up immediately ! you won't disappointed .	1

some books movies wwii haven't aged too well , not because they weren't good , but rather because material or humor so topical , doesn't make modern audience laugh or relate because they weren't there never understand these jokes , get subtle references , or just understand frame mind which this made which audiences time came it . there no doubt this film made during wwii , but even though lot situations jokes products specific time , they're quite funny easy understand . perhaps it not quite technically fine-tuned or tailor-made just them earlier movie masterpieces like ' chump oxford ' ' pack up your troubles ' , but there lot funny moments this . it seems like so many people said lh post-1940 films unfunny/embarrassing/pathetic/etc . people begin believe it never question it . yes , they're lacking special magic present hal roach studios , but doesn't take away fact they still quite funny always great job material . some funniest moments include when they're " helping " pretend-victim edgar kennedy ( wonderful see him playing their slow burn foil again ! ) , when they go into city hall receive their assignments , when they're mr. kennedy house later get into scuffle him ( scuffle leads them dismissed air raid wardens ) . i also immensely enjoyed subplot nazi spies who planning blow up factory , how boys alert townspeople somehow , even though they'd dismissed air raid wardens , save day end . sure it smacks made during wwii , but i love books movies wwii . still , there little things this movie make my rating more like 4.5 than full 5 , like how dumb stan ollie made out . they've always kinda dumb , that large part their appeal , but they dumb sweet endearing way , like two overgrown little kids who didn't know any better , not dumb practically borderline retarded . one jokes supposed stan struggling write four letters his name his air raid warden id card ; this way stupider than they're supposed , almost cruel laugh over , like asked laugh someone who retarded barely able write one name . ollie even says one point , " i guess we're not smart like other people . " i'd strongly recommend this one their best post-1940 features someone who into wwii , but not someone who isn't familiar boys already	1

this among most underrated films i ever seen . characters , casting , subplots , tony goldwyn superb directing , i simply cannot say enough this film . diane lane superb young wife mother whose youth came halt when she becomes pregnant 17 she later child after her daughter . lane character pearl adventurer free spirit who married good man who , alas , unbelievably conventional , uptight , boring , so unromantic i found myself wincing several times throughout movie . scene where he confronts pearl blouse man so lackluster i thinking , " yeah this guy seems really upset " . speaking blouse man ..... far i am concerned viggo mortensen most devine man who ever graced this planet . he already overwhelming artist activist , but when one adds his superb acting abilities list he almost unbearable . mortensen role jerome walker among his best performances far his most sensual . moment pearl meets walker attraction tangible she looks him sees everything she wants everything she wanted . her affair walker gives her back things taken away her when she became wife mother . mortensen beyond temptation knocking pearl door . way he moves , holds himself , looks every woman who comes into his bus seduction itself . he takes one look pearl knows what this woman lost what she needs regain part herself she sacrificed . moment he bites tag off tie-dye shirt he gives her ( one sexiest moves you ever seen ) you cheer this gorgeous couple wish pearl free order live her dreams this sublime man . love scenes this film beautifully practically set screen fire pearl abandons her barely-there inhibitions very obliging walker . perhaps most intense scene movie when pearl son injured while pearl walker . they pulling back up summer commune pearl accosted her fellow housewives tend her her injured child . she walker rush boy side , it walker ( much dismay pearl mother-in-law ) who knows how tend wounds comfort boy . after her son treated pearl husband rushes into house three parties love triangle same room . your heart breaks pearl her anguish written all over her face when her husband turns walker thanks him assisting their son , you don't hurt her you hurt her . it gut-wrenching scene so visual it almost more stirring when you mute audio . runner-up most poignant moment this film when pearl daughter watches her through pair binoculars woodstock . busted understatement millennium discovery . even so , pearl looks absolutely beautiful her joy freedom walker swings her around his arms . once more , viggo mortensen , low-slung pair tight pants , no shirt , artfully painted he lowers diane down slinkily crawls top her ..... lighter note , i would thinking " good job mom ! " ending happy bummer same time . i'm not going give it away but i thought pearl would make different choice than what she . when you watch scene pearl walker his room you understand what i mean . it moment viggo mortensen shows us what truly superb actor he naked emotion his face , voice , eyes . if you loved bridges madison county , you love walk moon . if you fan any actors this film you love it . if you viggo fan you need something cold drink if you just want see great movie this certainly leave you satisfied . above all else , this terrific selection watch someone you love .	1

" inspector clouseau " most obscure entry pink panther franchise , even more obscure than " curse pink panther " or " son pink panther . " technically third movie series , " inspector clouseau " finds alan arkin title role french inspector jacques clousea , character peter sellers started make famous two previous movies character sellers would become inextricably linked four more afterwards . " inspector clouseau " lacks boundless energy director shawn levy actor steve martin 2006 entry franchise or subtle sophistication any director blake edward actor peter sellers ' indisputable classics , but director bud yorkin actor alan arkin entry undeniably unique actually quite entertaining . " inspector clouseau " finds ever klutzy clouseau heading france london france again then onto switzerland take psychotic gang behind great train robbery , led mysterious " johnny rainbow " . clouseau assisted shifty scotland yard inspector weaver ( frank finlay , who played inspector lestrade " study terror " again " murder decree " ) who arms clouseau array james bond-style gadgetry . way clouseau , he always knack , finds his way into arms beautiful babes takes out dangerous underworld assassins trying kill him , all completely accident . bud yorkin directing style quite different blake edward , whole movie feels like completely different animal any other pink panther flicks . but movie finds charm sense fun all its own . lack jazzy henry mancini score adds distance other panthers , but ken thorne hummable score suitable replacement . memorable moments include scene where clouseau moves chair chair while debriefed scotland yard commissioner ( patrick cargill ) , scene where he finds himself " modeling " seductive photographer , hilarious sequence where he weaver become intensely competitive playing games speeding train . there also sufficient number twists turns make this movie worth look despite its obscurity .	1

here great film sprung forth czech new wave : film , through its small gestures subtleties makes some big statements . i'll leave it you all discover forman delightful insights into human behavior loves blonde . suffice it say , plot --- which involves young girl ( hana brejchov�) attempt find true love factory girl --- could become whimsical even sentimental other hands . forman , whole thing grounded earth . instead weightless romantic comedy , loves blonde aims realism , while forman maintains relatively light touch proceedings , everything happens her --- she finds love piano player , makes love him one night , then eventually pursues him his home , where she meets his ever-bickering parents --- still its own kind weight it . only way i describe it , i guess , weight real life . i haven't seen more accurate recreation marriage dulled out any other movie than i saw second half loves blonde , milda parents : it comic , yes , but it also uncannily realistic , maybe you'll recognize your own parents when you see control-freak mother carefree father this film . blonde movie ... well , she doesn't necessarily become sympathetic movie progresses , but we get sense why she begins attach herself piano player milda : she sees him escape drudgeries factory life . understand , you'll find ending this film poignant maybe kinda sad . ( her dream shattered , but she keeps believing it anyway , either out hope or simply desperation . ) but enough my pretentious analysis , hehe . point , milos forman loves blonde , like jiri menzel arguably more celebrated closely watched trains , film , though short 85 minutes , takes its time observe human nature face oppression , its own light subtle way . its comic surface only makes it seem like slight movie ; but its subtleties scenes comic observation , it heck lot more say our little human foibles than lot other romantic comedies . recommended	1
i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1
after watching " new jack city " , " sugar hill " definitely similar , but milder , pared down version former , still stark realities street life drug trade common denominator . while new jack , wesley snipes character " nino " cold , bloodthirsty , womanizing , heartless druglord . snipes ' role carmello sh much more conservative terms his mannerisims , attire , he compassionate , humane , sympathetic , but still not forgetting he first foremost drug kingpin who needs take care business . ironically , carmello must care his ailing father , whose life shambles result abusing same product made his own son rich , eventually succumbs . i would even go limb say nino njc could regarded re-incarnated life this film character(carmello ) . carmello eventually tires his life dealer , realizes there more life than jet set lifestyle , wealth material things . eventually , carmello given chance redemption , but must live rest his life crippling injury inflicted his own brother , who eventually dies well . carmello starts over far concrete jungles nyc new wife child . remarkable clarence williams , ernie hudson , vondie curtis-hall , lovely theresa randle , abe vigoda other actors add depth this film . even after 10 years , this movie still hits home	1
cruel sea excellent literature , wrenching novel , superb sea story , entirely faithful history world war ii north atlantic . monsarrat personal experience combined his eye detail make him extraordinary writer . his prose transport you very moment he describes . this authentic classic must-read everyone who would go sea , well every student wwii . i've re-read my well-worn copy several times over thirty years	1

this movie awesome ! my sister i used watch this all time back day so i ordered one each us . cinematography bit weird though , it seems recorded little differently dvd , it almost foreign look it ( like australian or some english tv/movies ) . it doesn't change viewing experience , i just little surprised when i watched it	1
this out all many versions jane eyre my least favorite ... granted samantha morton very adorable fairy/ elfin like face like mr rochesters description her , but her acting no highs lows . she stands up mr edwards little too much giving really snappy answers , seemingly no respect her employer , which not fault hers , writing script bad .... so direction . ciaran hinds totally over top . he so angry no understanding , his eyes very lustful times crazed . he not all like character described brontes epic book very sad tortured man who falls hopelessly love innocence singular personality earnest , honest yet strong sweet jane eyre charlotte bronte brought so vividly life her classic words . over acting both during proposal scene almost comical . me there no love , feeling or chemistry here two actors just lust .... he seems going through middle age crises just eyeing up this young girl , she though supposedy virgin ... she dosn't act like one . plus this movie seems very rushed you never get good foot hold story especially during janes childhood . i also miss gypsy scene omitted many these movies expertly dalton /clarke mini series , which brought some brief light heartednes otherwise very dark story . if you want see great versions . i highly rate 1944 movie orson wells though it abreviatd version , movie truly captured spirit feel . it moody dark mysterious . fantastic timothy dalton version which most accurate book all movies taking actual lines right brontes story . dalton clarkes acting simply superbly sublime ! however if you like me , see them all make your own decision . they all something offer most entertaining ...	-1
yesterday i went into british supermarket bought this dvd called " assassin " , because it bridget fonda cover , star , i thought she great " jackie brown " . i thought film rather ok : interesting anyway . then i tried find it amazon . nowhere ! no such movie . 43 movies " assassin " title , but this wasn't one them . bright idea struck me , i entered search bridget fonda . up pops this film called " point no return " , identical cover , swipe me if it isn't same film . what point this retitle ? no answer : no point . now i've read all reviews it bit shock learn " assassin " frame-by-frame remake french film called " nikita " , unknown me , original zillion times better . well , figures . american remakes european films inevitably dismally inferior , since americans totally lack seasoned culture , wit , irony understanding human nature which developed over couple thousand years europe . " assassin " , aka " point no return " , now ruined me . i see it all just provide opportunity bridget dive out cabbages mushrooms kitchen , generate computer-enhanced explosion tenth floor , step aside stunt-girls perform some athletic kung-fu , high-jumps fisticuffs . too bad . i still thought bridget rather good part , story sort interesting : now i know why . keitel seemed reprising ( or anticipating ? i'm not sure dates ) his cleaner-up role " pulp fiction " . there also seemed faint echoes " prisoner " --- once you're you cannot get out . reversed gender role-play seemed subversively signalling woman woman , even if she hit-person . better than 2 stars , i hardly ever give three . but i doubt it get better repeated viewings .	1
i won't give summary movie ( many reviews already ) but i say this . why no widescreen ? i believe region 2 version this dvd got widescreen presentation , but why people stuck region 1 dvd players get stuck full screen version ? i've seen widescreen edition it looks much better ! aside flaw , this great dvd worth buying if you love goofy max , loved 90s , love catchy music or just like disney general . 4 stars only because absent widescreen presentation . otherwise movie worth 5 stars	1

wow some people take children movies too seriously . i own harriet spy i still love it same since it came out i think it nick classic . if you think it its shame new generation kids grow up without movies like this . harriet spy few things it seem like its not children but if you pay attention watch it end it also teaches you appreciate what you plenty other good morals . movie description bit simple complicated same time its 11 yr old wants writer but her spying her writing actually its more like shes exploring writing everything she sees . you cant just read reviews movie you see it cause some reviews dont this great movie any justice . acting great story line very original thought provoking . if your parent you would like know if this good movie your kids well im tellin you it . i 8 when it came out it made me look some things differently . this great movie you shouldn't let your kids miss this this definitely teach children appreciate good friends more important good parents . i'm sorry if this review doesn't help or give good movie description but this very underrated movie leave good impression kids not bad one	1
ah , yes : frailty human condition . one moment domiciled , husband-doting grandmother ; next , moaning lover coupling man half her age . director roger michell reminds us we're all capable behaving outside box his moody film , mother . sixtysomething may ( anne reid ) , recently widowed , decides move london closer her two adult children . while getting closer kiddos -- learning more them , herself -- she finds herself physically attracted married carpenter ( daniel craig , new james bond dude ) who her son friend who also affair her daughter ( plot get any more tangled than ? ) . may throws caution wind affair young man -- affair definitely tweaks " ick " factor , subsequently turns her already fragile family upside down . reid plays her role robotically , unemotionally , while craig character less than flattering . matter fact , there isn't flattering -- or likeable -- character entire film , yet viewer drawn into this dysfunctional mess just like crowd rushing train wreck . mother indeed pay homage human condition , subtly pointing out its frailty same time . -- . mikels , author , reckonin	1
terrence malick acquired tremendous cult following auteur , but this , his first film , only truly successful one among them -- one finest films ever attempt capture donwside american dream ( it without pretentiousness ) . although many films inspired notorious 1950s killing spree charlie starkweather caril fugate , natural born killers frighteners , badlands really only one resonate -- part because it treats its starkweather-fugate analogues not quintessence gleeful evil but rather polite disaffected , making their killing spree all more astonishing . kit carruthers ( martin sheen ) handsome , well spoken , very gracious ; he chastises himself when he speaks ungrammatically records notes telling children very pietistic typical homilies playing fair listening minority opinions but acceding majority . he shoots father his girlfriend holly ( sissy spacek ) only when man threatens deny kit what he feels fairly his -- holly -- , thereafter he uses his gun means rid himself simply people who attempt arrest him . it becomes basically adolescent wish-fulfillment scenario . when kit holly escape forest build themselves elaborate treehouse , they become like swiss family robinson or huck joe raft escaping their pursuers . cinematography film widely praised , its extremely inventive use music ( carl orff " musica poetica " well songs mickey sylvia nat ' king ' cole ); sheen spacek could hardly improved upon central roles	1

you like cop movies ? if you then you're luck . alien nation essentially cop movie ... aliens . fact it just cop movie aliens what makes this movie little groundbreaking . however like any other genre movies , this cop movie isn't perfect . it falls into some same trappings most cop movies . spite alien nation innovative science fiction genre , even if innovation itself played out nausea elsewhere . this isn't high cop drama like black rain or heat . it isn't necessarily low cop drama either like v.i. warshowski or rookie . cop drama part pretty much middle . so what makes it innovative ? well ... it aliens . one things make really good science fiction when aspects real life get represented fashion . films like aliens their viet nam war contrast , contact its spiritual belief contrast , their holocaust similarities all stand out above crowd because they compare their situations real issues . alien nation same . not buddy cop themes but themes racial hatred discrimination . instead some other ethnic minority you get alien refugees planet . you get all parallels bigotry modern society this film , they address it concise manner . said it still cop movie overall . oddly matched police officers learning accept each other , drug lord looking take over , lots gunplay cop jokes ... they all end up here . this aspect movie merely average . just like all other cop movies you seen over decades . cinematography , settings , script , style all fall victims cop movie theme they all nothing really write home when compared other police films . this doesn't mean script , cinematography other stuff i mentioned bad . it just doesn't stand out above crowd . appreciate alien nation what it : parallel society discrimination against people different than us . understand fact vehicle they used portray this , it appropriate one , clich�d cop plot . if you like cop movies sci-fi then you found winner here . rest you i won't say it overall great movie , but i say it pretty good one .	1

" conversation " little seen masterpiece francis ford coppola , made " godfather " " godfather pt . ii . " it mystery-drama , plays like horror movie similar nicolas roeg film " don't look now " sense works dread , rather than fright . two-time academy award winner gene hackman plays harry caul , wiretapper whom we first meet he recording conversation young couple park . caul sees his job job , he doesn't get involved people he records nor he pay much attention details conversation . he supposed record it deliver it . his suspicions begin grow tape when he tries personally deliver it mysterious person who asked it instead badgered man assistant ( harrison ford ) it . same time we begin realize how bad caul his job . his partner stanley ( john cazale ) quit already began working wiretapper . superintendent his apartment building managed get inside his multi-locked apartment drop off birthday present . ladyfriend his tells harry time she watched his spying someone hour ... it no wonder when rival wiretapper comes his office him he manages record intimant conversation harry woman . while mystery revolving around " conversation " continues , harry begins deciphering some sentences his suspicions confirmed when he hears sentence : " he'd kill us if he got chance ? " this question fuels rest movie , until very creepy superb climax . some most haunting parts film come end this due visuals film . one much-talked scene comes when harry flushes toilet motel room it begins overflowing blood . this scene ( few follow it ) some most effectively creepy scenes i've seen long time . gene hackman superb harry caul , multi-layered character page must seemed very one-dimensional . harry man no personal life , almost no friends , he man lives shrouded mystery . coppola already proved time this movie came out he cinematic genius , but he mostly known movies like " godfather " " apocalypse now . " those films 3 hour long epic films , but i think really see how much range coppola director it nice take look " conversation . " few people seen this movie , it much smaller scale film most his movies but it truly masterwork . great acting , great direction , great art direction , great cinematography . grade :	1
titan ae really good scifi movie . it fantastic visuals , chases , good enough story keep you interested . voice acting also pretty good . unfortunately movie suffers what many movies , especially this genre , suffer . they don't commit adult or child-based audience , nor go after strictly scifi audience or more general audience . so what ends up happening you get just enough both , without fully focusing one target audience , kind sterile , but still good . if you looking mind blowing concepts something other than ' standard scifi fare ' this isn't where look . if you want good movie keeps you entertained kids watch too , this great flick .	1

i'm not into slasher-type horror flicks ; viewing people get hacked death holds no fascination me . yet , i find " friday 13th " flicks appealing some reason ; possibly because they usually involve young adults fun camp-type environment , which naturally stirs fond youthful memories . story centers around halfway house troubled youths middle nowhere . tommy jarvis , who still traumatized events previous film , arrives home . murders slowly start mounting up leading action-packed climax . first film series serious murder-mystery horror picture . this not case part . although " new beginning " plays it semi-straight , it numerous goofy , campy elements . fact , there so many laugh-out-loud moments it almost comedy . which not say it bad ; matter fact , these aspects makes part highly entertaining re-watchable . film notable featuring three very lovely women -- blond , brunette redhead no less . blond " pam " played melanie kinnaman , protagonist story . melanie so incredibly gorgeous it hard take your eyes off her if you're red-blooded male . i originally caught this film tv so when i recently picked up uncensored dvd i bit surprised amount needless cussing ; little bit here there reasonable reasistic ( not mention amusing , if right way right time ) but it bit overdone here ( just bit ) . i'm sure filmmakers threw it simply comical touch . any case , it goes without saying if you find overkill cussing offensive you might want skip this one . bottom line : dvd worth picking up if no other reason than beholding awe-inspiring , succulent beauty melanie kinnaman ( which explains my title mantra ) . other than , it just very fun entertaining flick . criticisms regarding absence certain character -- who really gives flying freak ? film good job showing what ultimately happen those severely traumatized jason . so , yes , it belongs series .	1

if they bringing high mighty dvd finally , then maybe it time unravel complications surrounding this film feature it dvd . so proudly we hail one greatest all war movies , because it told woman point view ( so speak , it still male director person mark sandrich ) it sometimes ridiculed derided , usually armchair critics who should walk mile nurse shoes before daring denigrate her bravery under fire . claudette colbert plays janet davidson . unusual choice nurse , colbert eschews most her usual glamor ( except san francisco embarkation ) really gives herself part . colbert often good when she play against strong women , here sandrich surrounds her gallery independent types , way francois ozon made catherine deneueve shine recent 8 1/2 women . janet born leader even though she only photographed one side her face , which somewhat limits her utilitarian duty during battle scenes . even covered grime jungle grease , colbert still turn heads , when she meets george reeves , sparks ignite , hot enough burn corregidor down ground . veronica lake plays up her dark side playing lieutenant d'arcy , time bomb just waiting explode . often seen soignee bewitching , cute fringe hair playing peekaboo her eyes , lake here going cornell woolrich-style vengeance against japanese . if tarantino made kill bill 1940s lake would beat uma thurman role easily . she hotter than pistol she ms. 45 . paulette goddard , i think , most challenging role i agree other reviewers who say this goddard best part . while colbert lake really just occupy same acting space throughout movie , goddard character change , so viewers watch her mature fly night flapper only men her mind , woman heart who lives help others , not just impress them her oomph . it harder than it looks walk line , but goddard pulls it off without whimper . often cast sexpot pure simple , or gold-digging mantrap she apparently real life , goddard entirely persuasive her role , like lake , she natural action scenes . i want her my nurse . her romance " kansas " kind cute too . all all , underrated movie kind plot screws deeper deeper , unbearably tight , like das boot , except set pacific	1

i first saw this movie tv years ago ; they advertising it , since i'd never seen or even heard it before , i intrigued premise , i decided give it go . i missed part film when friend called , but i hooked it after we hung up . it not perfect film . there plot holes , yes . but reeve seymour so good , so believable , they draw you . i read reeve took some criticism after film released too sensitive his portrayal richard collier ! well , 1980 you , folks . dvd problem , or maybe it just my copy , where times film , image suddenly becomes rather jerky . fortunately , this doesn't last . i enjoyed watching interviews , hard though it see once-vibrant christopher reeve wheelchair , talk around operation his respirator . it hard , too , see him film , walking running ease . there just something this film takes hold you . i mentioned before , reeve seymour give perfect performances . i suppose magic here relationship them really works , this such rare thing anywhere , any time , we willingly suspend our disbelief . they both fit into their roles if parts written only them . it not " chick-flick " . it so much more	1

amusing , entertaining .... two words i would use describing this holiday confection samuel goldwyn . lavish sets , costumes , music good performances cooper norwegian sigrid gurie(she equally good three faces west john wayne ) . sigrid gurie suffered greatly her shaky career : time mof this film it found out she born flatbush , brooklyn " siren fjords " " fake " . fact her parents norwegian moved back norway when sigrid 11 months dismissed . ( their ship not so far titanic when it sunk ... ) vivien leigh born darjeeling , india liv ullmann tokyo . they never labeled indian or japanese . there many similar examples why poor sigrid suffered this idiotic case unbelivable . goldwyn indeed called it " great hoax " ... why sigrid left goldwyn after " algiers " no wonder . but she leave us this film , algiers three faces west - she playes each role differently . it`s shame goldwyn didn`t look after her - me may star tradition dietrich garbo . though i must say ; sigrid gurie quality presence all her own :-)	1
many reviewers seem rate monsieur ibrahim highly because omar sharif smiling presence . this caused them overlook , however , film canyon-sized plot holes overarching sentimentality . i agree film its good points : scenery ( parisian street scenes apartments , turkish countryside ) , music , lesser degree , sharif performance ( when it avoids ladling syrup ) . certain individual scenes work well . now questions : who father , why he such miserable human ? why mother leave ? more important , why she briefly come back ? there brother , or not ? there holocaust angle ? if not , why ? or why keep it completely oblique ? what planet beautiful , sweet , happy prostitutes imported ? boy no peers rely ( or corrupted by) ? should lonely old shopkeeper thought best only source wisdom 16-year-old boy ? even if wisdom doesn't rise above level what forrest gump would say ? if this supposed early 1960s , why word " algeria " not come up conversation ? some , these questions irrelevant , however , given chance see aging omar sharif screen . others , beware	1

i drawn into watching dirt one reason only ; courtney cox . but if you're expecting sweet loveable monica ' friends ' , you're big shock . courtney plays shallow , mean clearly self-hating lucy who runs tabloid gossip magazine named dirtnow , all while trying control everyone around her dismay her [ ... ] brother ( who secretly affair tom cruise like character ) , her innocent apprentice ( who took drugs first time lucy " get story " ) , her psychotic childhood friend ( who she depends get juiciest pictures her magazine ) killer mob boss record producer who keeps head his latest victim pickle jar . dirt not faint heart or those offended real human sexuality . it gripping , interesting quite sad view worst human nature , what we or won't love , money success . i'm honestly hooked i love show , despite lack " sweet monica " , courtney cox rocks	1
i can't understand why so many people singing praises this film . others pointed out , this film none-too-subtle ripoff , primarily " jacob ladder " ( which , itself , inspired " occurrence owl creek bridge " ) but also elements " one flew over cuckoo nest , " " twelve monkeys , " probably other classics sanity-bending genre i can't recall moment . we not even five minutes into film yet when i turned friend i watching it said , " this going end up ' jacob ladder ' remake ? " that how blatant it . thirty minutes into it , i mentally naming films each sequence film stolen whenever there scene change . there even shot which we see adrien brody character staring into coffee cup , camera slowly descends toward surface liquid exact copy similar scene " taxi driver . " now , i'm well aware stealing ( aka " influence " ) hallowed tradition all fields art , influenced one predecessors not itself bad thing . problem this film not even tenth good any films it steals , not even hundredth original . film intent seems merely try give you same sense creepiness dread you get its sources , but it completely lacks their depth . " jacob ladder , " " twelve monkeys " " cuckoo nest " great because you delve deeply into souls mental confusion central characters . all characters " jacket " interesting cardboard cutouts i never came care what happened any them . only reason i even gave this film two stars because incredible acting talent ( brody , jennifer jason leigh , etc . ) wasted it . how adrien brody able stomach this after doing " pianist , " i no idea . their talents worthy greater productions than this . don't waste your time .	1

this best version alice adventures wonderland , starring fiona fullerton alice , dvd . previous editions very shoddy - yet film so great even those watchable despite fading colors graininess . this new ( 2005 ) edition colors brought back which really nice . graininess could still use some work though it would really wonderful if major studio would buy rights this film proper restoration . there also music important scene cut this film - two songs never made it theatrical release one scene where alice meets cheshire cat tree cut before original release - very curious thing very popular scene book ! it would great if next dvd release this film could proper restoration also include some special features . many actors this film went become major stars ( ex - michael crawford phantom fame ) special features could include deleted scene if it still exists original soundtrack recording well some interviews stars - like what chitty chitty bang bang willy wonka . don't expect any special features this edition - there aren't any -- more surprisingly there no menu all - bare bones , but still classic important film alice lovers - much more reminiscent lewis carrols books characters than disney film	1

i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1

this version " four feathers " excellent , story much deeper than newest version ( starring heath ledger ) . other reviewers told you what story , so i won't go into tha t.t his movie excellent cast including following : beau bridges , jane seymour , robert powell . all actors excellent job making you believe they who they . battle sequences leave more than little desired , but they excellent day . love story very believable not include any sexual scenes or unecessary nudity . man who plays father also very good , i'm glad all back story why beau bridges character way he . overall , story really very good , but it battle sequences saddning part . you clearly see men not stabbed several sequences . well , minor quibble . anyway , see movie , it doesn't contain any sexuality ( unlike new version ) should plus most parents adults	1

" bible ... beginning " first 22 chapters genesis , more or less , put into film , including stories creation , adam eve , cain abel , noah , tower babel , abraham . goes two half hours intermission too . it got some great photography , interesting score , some great sets like tower babel ark . it pretty straightforward most part , though noah scenes bit lighthearted . you tell they lot fun all animals .	1

i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1

river runs through it difficult film review or even fairly comment upon . it beautifully-filmed overflowing sort natural scenery --- thick dark forests , cold , free-flowing rivers , wide-open skies --- most movies would steal show . it also features cast actors , tom skerit , emily lloyd , craig sheffer , brad pitt , giving what i long remain convinced most outstanding performance their careers . this classic 1991 motion picture ( re-)tells true story writer norman maclean youth early adulthood nearly century ago wilds rural montana . norman deep , pensive person , many ways opposite his younger brother paul , free-spirited daredevil whose adventurous nature good-hearted but perilous , everyone around him except paul himself seems see . norman paul father upstanding presbyterian minister whose scholarly erudition sternly eloquent sermons give way frequent intervals undertaking great passion his life : fly fishing . reverend maclean loves nothing more than take his sons river fly fish trout . these trips elder maclean imparts life lessons boys passes words wisdom they each go recall during course their lives . time passes film we leave boys youths rediscover them young men . visiting norman returned home 1920 , completed college east . paul now somewhat infamous regional newspaperman , who uses his articles skewer corrupt local figures business politics . where norman every bit staid responsible his childhood hinted he would grow , paul hard-drinking charmer whose fondness high-stakes poker games frontier saloons nights out wilder local women stands odds his upbringing respected maclean household . during summer follows norman homecoming after graduation , he his brother father once again return river fly fish , norman finds love beautiful girl neighboring town , entire maclean family watches paul slowly destroys himself fast life he cannot seem leave alone . film tells kind engrossing , touching story very few cinematic works , one crowning jewels modern motion picture achievement . river runs through it times funny , others profound , throughout it radiates its quality , ultimately ... ultimately i hope anyone reading this see this great film him or her self	1

i rather impressed how strong this film . heard not much it i expecting ' da hood ' film . i didn't much confidence ernest dickerson ( surviving game , demon knight ) his direction hasn't matured past decade . i eat my words now . he definitely brings strong visual integrity never die alone . dmx turns believable performance king david new york drug dealer who legs it la when he steals his bosses stash . upon his return years later he promptly offed two-bit thug . his dying moments he bequeaths his entire legacy investigative reporter david arquette ( who great his role too ) . before night over arquette pieces together his life awful past full heinous crimes unleashed , but it not over yet arquette becomes marked death king david still very angry boss . mere 88 minutes never die alone tells intriguing story non-chronological order sets up remarkable array complexly interwoven characters . it surely character drama first before anything else . don't misjudge it no more than violent ' gangsta ' thriller . violence brutal honest but it not distract , none it superfluous . dickerson direction gothic , urban noir edge it feel 1950 pulp novel . it dark , very dark some may feel slightly uncomfortable how frank never die alone it depiction misogyny utter ruthlessness it central , highly evil character . dvd 2.35 : 1 anamorphic widescreen dolby 5.1 sound . there bunch extras i never time check out . but this definitely movie fans ( initially unrecognisable ) dmx , just don't expect one those nice but bad characters he played exit wounds or cradle 2 grave . king david bad , bad man	1
i tend agree high praise here , but i few thoughts add . first off , every shot beautifully photographed there some simply amazing tracking shots . sense , this " art " movie if there ever one , perhaps reflecting it ( alleged ) subject matter . little this seems flamboyant its own sake . aspect worth note medieval " feel " movie . times it really seems if someone took film camera back 700 years or so . oh , it should mentioned what tremendous testicles tarkovsky must take his subject matter , early 1960 russia , renowned medieval icon painter . this mighty thumb nose soviet state arguably act subversion . pacing slow , but no more glacial than movie like 2001 , or once upon time america , say . but here brass tacks novices know : this movie episodic say least , only film i know wherein title character takes lengthy vow silence . when vow finally up , movie seems lose interest andrei altogether , he becomes background figure . but it here , finally tarkovsky shows what he straight ahead narrative -- although narrative isn't andrei . it young son newly deceased bell maker , who insists his father told secrets bell making only him . it'll mean his head if he . . -ing , we viewers aren't sure . here where movie picks up pace emotional power . how much this power relies two previous no t-t oo-seemingly-connected hours hard say . oh , vladimir gets sacked . convincingly . there images scenes stick your ribs . it help if you're already interested art , religion , russia , or splendid cinematography . or bell making , come think it . if one your neighbors begins medieval smelting process their back yard , odds they've inspired this film	1
one unusual aspects this holiday special it rarely focuses charlie brown . rather , pepperment patty central figure , she takes challenge teaching her friend , marcy , how color eggs . other aspect this program it relies visual gags surreal humor welcome spring rather than delivering message most peanuts programs . it seems appropriate , though , given feelings evoked easter . all peanuts specials , color pallette score cartoon beautifully represent time year . trivia question-what day year it ? hint-look sign tells you how many days left christmas !!	1

this movie based semi-autobiographical novel , " bastard out carolina , " written famous feminist , lesbian author , dorothy allison . analogous book it based , this film genuinely poignant disquieting piece art too shocking aired originally planned tnt . more importantly , director ( anjelica houston)does stellar job portraying main events characters relation actual occurrences described novel . author dorothy allison claims through writing novel " bastard , " she able gain perspective some most horrific events her childhood . whole , movie chronicles life illegitimate young girl named bone , who born into close-knit , yet extremely impoverished south carolina family known boatwrights . naturally , character bone meant represent author she recounts various memories her childhood . bone life begins well enough- -she grows up amongst loving single mother named anney , younger half-sister ( reese ) , many drunken , flamboyant aunts uncles . however , bone life takes turn worse when her mother marries man named glen , whom bone later forced call " daddy glen .
