there oughta law . i utterly guarantee this thing won't work . i employed pest control industry 16 years . we used find cockroaches living such devices all time ( it usually nice toasty warm there ) . sanitation , exclusion , very careful application pesticides what you need . rodents sometimes repelled brief time , but quickly adapt ( adapting environmental conditions one things rats best ) . again , count sanitation , exclusion , traps ; try avoid baits because you'd rather know where little s.o.b. died ( i.e. trap , rather than wall somewhere )	-1

well , i ordered this online we couldn't find any window-mounted feeders locally . it lasted exactly two weeks . problem extremely weak design : 14oz glass feeder fairly heavy-too heavy stay attached any glass two measly suction cups , this . there somewhat strange instructions this model , directing user quot ; rubquot ; suction cups several minutes order ( supposedly ) build up proper quot ; suctionquot ; -then glass slides into groove ; well , thing worked first-until i slide out glass bottle portion refill it . i it gingerly i could , not disturbing my preciously attached suction cups , refilled it(only halfway ! )-and replaced it . 4 minutes went by-and then entire thing-glass , suction cups , everything-fell our deck , breaking into million thick glass shards ... frustrating me , hummers-and our two dogs , banished outside until i could clean up this mess . what crummy product ! overpriced-although i wouldn't buy it again two cents . beware	-1

this grill it all , six burners , side burner , rotisserie infrared burner smoker box dedicated burner . grill grates 3/8 " stainless steel rods provide great grill marks your food . grill heats up 600 degrees less than 10 minutes , but it burn through propane rather quickly , but wouldn't any different any 60,000 btu grill . i able put grill together myself little over hour . fit pieces fantastic end result attractive incredibly stable grill . it two pull-up counters stainless steel inserts , cabinet stainless doors . so far i made countless steaks , dogs chicken breasts all came out same due even temperature grill . my old charbroil would give me two raw breasts , two good breasts , two overcooked breasts ... not this grill . i also slowed cooked some ribs smoker box going meat fell off bone . but , best meal yet rotisserie chicken i prepared rub injected marinade . skin crispy meat tender juicy . we'll making many more those chickens future . weber known commodity . they built last , given quality components ( care ) i expect this grill last least 15 years . many people end up get rid their weber after 10 , 12 , 15 years because cart rusted out , but that not issue this grill cart constructed 304 stainless steel . all all , great grill last long time . my only cons would propane consumption maybe size . it probably little too big me my family , but it only weber all features i wanted ( mainly rotisserie smoker box burner ) . if they four burner model those options i would gotten , but alas weber summit platinum d4 not exist	1

i've using stainless steel weber grates few weeks now , replaced old porcelain ones . i think heating quicker , more event , perhaps even more absorbing items grill . not sure if makes sense , but it seems foods seem heat through adequately shorter amount time without getting overcooked . i tend keep burners down low turn cover down almost everything i cook . i'm little disappointed grates don't stay shiny stainless steel , even areas which i don't lay down foods . i guess that because all heat swirling around when i cover closed . all all , i give this hearty recommendation	1

i am amazed . my mom sent this me after i'd complained already eaten alive mosquitos this year . i don't just get bites ; i get huge , oddly shaped , so-itchy-they're-almost-painful , welts . i am person who attracts every single biting insect . i often wished i sweated deet . however , i don't . i tried this dubiously , first morning--i'd getting bites every day 8 10am ( even high % deet ) . -- no bites . -- i still didn't believe it . i used it again evening -- after rainstorm come through -- 6pm 10pm . no bites ! it comes belt clip , but i left it outside one point when i came inside . second i left its side , mosquito landed me . i , since then , used it several more times , no insect spray all , it very muggy around here . absolutely no bites . i seen couple more bees than usual , it turns out ingredient this blows out ( geraniol ) said attract bees . not big deal me . it apparently doesn't work everyone . i always assumed there some sort chemical i give off makes mosquitos head straight me , bypassing everyone else . ( i might party where no one else even sees mosquito i leave over dozen bites . ) i wonder if geraniol somehow combines whatever it i put out neutralizes it . this could explain why it would work some people not other people . this price , it worth it find out if you one people whom it might work ! i figure if i replace cartridge every 2 weeks ( ~ $3.50 /cartridge ) , i even saving money because i'd going through 1-2 cans high-deet bug spray per week	1
while principle product rather simple ( flat piece metal spikes sticking up ) , it very useful . instructions very easy - coat light coating oil , drop potatoes metal spikes . stick bbq cook . allegedly cooks faster than potatoes would oven . here my reflections after my first time using this contraption : 1 ) i started cooking potatoes same time steak vegetables . time my steak asparagus cooked , potatoes needed 10 minutes or so . hindsight , i should started potatoes while grill heating up ; they would time2 ) i varied original instructions - wrapping two four potatoes aluminum foil before placing them spikes . they cooked faster , though less roasted taste ( i found very desirable ! )3 ) one four spikes i placed sweet potato - which tasted fantastic after coming off grill ! it needed no foil , cooked little faster than exposed ( foil-free ) potatoes . summary , you should probably start cooking potatoes while grill heating up . you wrap them foil make job faster ; though it cut back nice roasted flavor you otherwise get . i gave it 4 stars because it isn't 100% non-stick , even coat oil . when i pull potatoes off rack , they tend stick spike tear part potato open . still taste great , though	1
i received cover , it fits just picture indicates , it comes down wheel . i leave charcoal underneath mine , haven't any problems rain soaking it . cover heavy-duty seems very good quality . i'm pleased my purchase	1
i can't complain durability these sensors . i bought original la crosse weather station 5 years ago while located texas . it recorded temperatures high 113 degrees since i moved nj 2.5 years ago , it also recorded low 18 below . i'd say that pretty durable unit so no qualms buying replacement when original one quit recording humidity bounced around temperature readings within short timeframes . i'm back working now i this unit ... i can't live without my weather station la crosse nice looking works	1
i recently purchased this model replace separate radio controlled atomic clock wired in/out thermometer . unit seems well made display easy read . based upon my experience so far i would still buy one but design/implementation could certainly improved . 1 - remote distance 80 ' line sight under perfect conditions . manual suggests deduct 20-30 feet external wall . if there wasn't external wall it wouldn't outdoors now would it ? 2 - time day only updated once day at/near midnight . my unit off 2 seconds noon . not big deal but one would expect bit more accuracy . 3 - algorithyms computing sunrise/sunset moonrise/moonset seem off couple minutes when compared values intellicast , etc . 4 - temperatures humidities seem accurate compared other measurements i . 5 - even though it ' rain cap ' external sensor must out direct rain fall such under eaves . 6 - oak trim just vinyl decal plastic . nobody going confuse it real wood . however , spite my criticisms i think it good unit approximate weather monitoring	1
