oral-b good product but refills certainly aren't worth what they charge them . i don't know you but it always annoyed me when you get held hostage company buy their refills item they sold you rip-off price . they could make great profit selling these refills something like $2.50 each , their rip off price $8.50 ea beyond absurd . other thing when you buy their toothbrush they something there like brush heads last 2 months . that real laugh . even brushing just once day , you're lucky if you get month out them . so not only they rip you off their refill cost , they also lie you get you locked into their product begin	-1

i am big fan regular clic reading glasses . i own several pairs think they great . however , sport goggles not get my vote confidence . they three problems which make them unusable me : 1 ) all clic products there all important stem adjustment adjusts length stems properly fit glasses onto your head . however , unlike very cool regular reading glasses clic , sport googles not adjust properly so goggles run very tight if you need even slightly above average stem legnth , 2 ) there also extra foam padding sport googles make them very snug , but because tight stems foam padding makes these glasses far too tight enjoy 3)the maker doesn't make it clear they should their description ... irridium ( red)colored lens some sports goggles far too intensely tinted dark any kind regular light conditions or applications like morning driving ... or even safe walking rocky path . sorry clic , but your success reading glasses went your head ... you needed more user testing comfort vision sports goggles . i would like return them larger size lighter colored lens ... too bad me !	-1

i'm 26m , 6 ' 185 growing . work out regularly , mostly weights basketball . i'm allergic peanuts , which makes most protein bars off-limits me . this only bar i've found where non-peanut flavors don't contain trace amounts peanuts set off my allergies . incredible , if only reason . but there more . 20g protein . wow . this meal replacement if you're road or it mid-morning , early-evening or even late-night snack , especially if you're trying build lean muscle shooting 1.5 or more grams protein per pound body weight . it easy 20 . carbs real , review says . it clean energy , effective either before or after workout . i prefer take liquid protein after workout , body absorbs it faster , but pinch this would great choice . beyond it little crispy little chewy , there physical satisfaction eating it makes experience complete . but , review said , this isn't intended diet bar , it men women who work hard use lots energy throughout day , hence name " builders bar . " i guess if you ate half one instead meal , it might work way . finally taste outstanding , when stacked against other bars ( although i haven't tried many , due peanut allergies ) . if you close your eyes pretend , it really could dessert . i stick cookies cream or chocolate . chocolate yummy dunked hot coffee mid-morning . i buy box every two weeks keep stocked home , work oftentimes one car just case i get hungry . review said outside chocolate got crumbly , this true , if it gets hot melted . when things solidify they crumble . doesn't change taste but it messy . keep them cool you're good shape . i've even tried putting them freezer prior eating , not bad but no significant difference . thank you clif	1

i ordered this thermometer week ago , when i returned my doctor office sinus infection fever . i thought it would accurate , especially based reviews . when i received it , i took 10 readings . temperature went 103 degrees 95 degrees . no two same . last night i tried it my husband same effect . this disappointing waste money , say least . if there rating less then one star , i'd give it instead	-1
i've it one day it seems accurate . i calibrated ua-787ej against manual setup ( stethiscope , gauge cuff ) i purchased last week readings consistant . i read first review stated their disatisfaction b/c readings " high " . i would recommend calibrating unit yourself if it off , return it or refund . last week i've tested several monitors local stores ( omron , relion , lifesource ) i felt all them reported low bp readings . i even ordered one very eratic its readings but always 10 12 points lower than readings taken w/a stethiscope ( sometimes i used bp machine wal-mart , which seemed consistent ) . i returned it refund . i work hospital , co-worker used new ua-787ej this morning , found his blood pressure very high , went down er indeed it extremely high . if you doubts accuracy , i suggest purchasing manual steth ., gauge cuff your own calibartion . it only way i could confident automatic unit accurate reliable . manual setup only costs $16.00 wal-mart ( maybe less amazon ) taking your bp easy .	1

i wasn't sure what make all these conflicting reviews but i needed shaver this shaver represented pretty good value . i took chance i don't regret it . switched straight edge electric past , i knew my skin needed adjust new treatment . right box remington red warning tag says exactly . first few shaves rough ... my skin felt looked raw few patches . not good experience frankly it what i suspect most negative reviews here based . however , made this transition past i intent completing adjustment . well , it two weeks shaves fine . better than fine , shaves very close leaving wonderfully smooth face . irritation almost completely gone really only appears when i'm too vigorous parts my neck tender skin . i consider this more my fault than shaver . electric shaving isn't everyone . furthermore , there shavers which treat skin more tenderly but not produce close shave . given variety faces shavers there no " one size fits all " . however , if you like rotary electric shaving , you don't overly sensitive skin , you want really smooth close result then you should consider this shaver	-1

excellent scale- ever since i bought it , i've losing weight since i accurately tell how much i weigh . it must weight loss . i weighed 176 day i got it , i'm 157 right now . water percentage , it worthless- long you're over 50% ( male ) , your fine . it related body fat % . body fat % fluctuates too much great . it good rough estimate- but i go 16-19% depending when i weigh myself . i find i'm 16% when i follow recommended advice ( don't eat 2 hours then weight yourself ) , but that definitely too low my opinion . i still got small beer belly . 19% seems more accurate i get after i eat . but body fat percentage definitely gone down since i lost weight , so like i said -it good estimate , but don't worry 3% fluctuations . i think key this scale note your lowest weight ( morning when you get up , just weigh only option ) . way if weight goes down , you know you lost weight ! it amazing how many pounds you gain right after your eat ( clothes weight 2-5 pounds depending jeans/pajamas , etc .	-1

i bought this product hopes shave less often dual epilator/shaver feature . over all i am very pleased . like other reviewers i think legs armpits it works best shower when you nice lathered up soap - lather helps get rid friction head moves over skin it much smoother shave . i found without lather movement somewhat jerky , head didn't slide over skin smoothly it more painful . legs especially shins , it still painful although not painful epilator i tried . it works absolutely great ( when lathered up ) armpits . i both them quickly , completely very little pain - i think your armpits must less sensitive . i my bikini area - again definately works better hurts less when your skin lathered up . i say this definately painful process . while it still works great this area , i think waxing may stil best couple reasons . 1 ) waxing whole area one fell swoop therefore you only pain moment opposed several minutes epilator ; because your bikini line so sensitive , this makes big difference . 2 ) it nearly impossible epilate " shape " your grooming because bulkiness head . unless you're removing all hair it would difficult just certain area . ( this reason i gave four stars not five)i happend few mutant hairs my chin i pluck every now again ; just giggles i tried it my face ( dry ) . it worked awesome . i ran over my chin only couple times it got even smallest thinest hairs you couldn't really see . overall great product but not best bikini area	-1

i tried using my mom old hot rollers once ( heavy kind , spikes pins ) because i wanted curly hair , but easily discouraged because they really hard put they hurt my head . not so these rollers caruso ! steam itself heats up 1 minute or less rollers also heat up fast ( 1 roller time , 10 seconds or less ) , they're so easy put . they're foam , so they don't hurt my head , they're not too hot handle , shields hold each roller place securely so they don't fall out . you also use combs help wrap shorter pieces hair . i medium-length , thick hair , probably left rollers 45 minutes , although directions say you really only need leave them 15 minutes after putting last roller . longer doesn't hurt , though . neither blow drying speed up process . smaller rollers gave me look i going . they made my hair soft , manageable , curly . i skeptical first , but am pleasantly surprised results . it worth money . i would highly recommend this product	1

centrum-brand vitamins made quality company , which important buying vitamins . since vitamin industry not regulated fda , manufacturers put just anything label sell their product , many ! oft times supposed ingredients not even product , this why name-brand product essential . centrum-brand one consumer trust . centrum-silver product targeted adults those older than 55 years age . however , this vitamin formulation taken any adult effectiveness . vitamins elements chemical compounds help body cells function better , mostly area cell/body metabolism . if one eats balanced diet high greens fruits , extra store-bought vitamins probably not essential , vitamins supplied adequate quantities food consumed . however , typical american diet notorious high sugars low veggies fruits , therefore making supplemental vitamins important . diets high sugars demand more vitamin compounds help metabolize sugars . since average american consumes more than 110 pounds dietary ( table sugar : , sucrose ) sugars each year , supplemental vitamins important if not essential take daily basis . when selecting vitamin product , it important get basic vitamins , such a e , but it also important get minerals trace elements too , these compounds elements essential metabolism cellular health body various functions including immune system . this product all basics covered more , why i like it . most vitamin companies when formulating their vitamin compound give 100% rda or more . i am not believer mega-vitamins ( formulations provide many times more than rda ) because body only use so much extra generally excreted urine . only exception this rule fat-soluble vitamins , ( vitamin , , ) . fat-soluble vitamins stored excess body reach toxic levels . this mind , it makes no sense continually consume fat-soluble vitamins excess . one final thing : many manufacturers make claims their vitamin product going make you " feel " better , sensation vitality noticable . perhaps if you state malnutrition many years , this claim may valid some , but i taken vitamins most my life , i feel same whether i take them or not . rather than judge effectiveness vitamins how they " feel " , judge them instead knowing you all bases covered terms cell metabolism , once this covered , your cells healthy nutrition make them . jim " konedog " koeni	1
