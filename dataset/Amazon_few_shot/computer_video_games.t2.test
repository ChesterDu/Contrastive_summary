said earlier review creators final fantasy giving us everything but what we actually asked . they gave us advent children , cell phone games , finally dirge cerberus . this game action based game showing you day life most under-used least interesting character final fantasy series . its creators way telling us they never re-make final fantasy vii but rather insult us every marketing ploy know man	-1
i got this game during summer expecting it great fun . well ... it caught my interest few weeks then i just got bored it . i'd only recomend it people who not get bored easily	1
i guess first thing i'll say i got jedi academy before i got this game . i hugely dissaponted . i really liked jedi academy but this game not great . i cheat codes so i all wepons all amo i undying . there partes this game insainly tought . there way many puzzles - i don't mind puzzles but there simply way many . some them insainly hard . i would recomend you get jedi knight : jedi academy - way better puzzles aren't insain you get choose what you look like .... well i could go but i'll leave it there . if you aredy jedi academy you want star wars game $20 then you sould get battlefront thats anoter great game . just don't get this game .	1
i loved " incredibles , " so i excited play game . i've only playing video games last couple years , only off , so i'm really just beginner . perhaps explains enormous difficulty i've this game . my boyfriend long-time video game player , he able things one or two tries i labored hours over . even using cheat codes not really help me all much . i surprised when i read review said game too easy . i almost cried . lol but seriously , unless you good gamer , you're probably going more frustrated than challenged this game . me , i guess i'll stick action rpgs	-1
i bought this game whim , really liked need speed : hot pursuit 2 . this game needs help . first all , frame rate lower than it should . there slow-down well . even game before this , need speed : underground 2 looked 100 times better . car models most wanted touch nicer-looking there far better selection than underground 2 , but that only plus this game it . you don't race much fly around city barely-controlled frenzy , trying stay ahead computer cars . winning more luck than skill . he or she who hits least obstacles wins . hardly enjoyable way race ! i get too stressed when playing this game , so i put it away while . definitely rent before buying this game .	1
this game originally released 10 dollars . almost everything it pulled straight diablo not quite good . though this game few things it interesting , enjoyable some people , i would just skip this game go diablo 2	-1

this supposed x-box cleaner , but system not read disc . shoddy product	-1
i want take moment address battle system license system . these systems , while well-conceived , completely ruined game me . example , license system , itself , very good idea : it allows player craft character his liking tastes . problem lies execution . say , example you want learn " steal . " not only you get license it but you also purchase it game . this presents problems . my game , example , my characters possess suite licenses they cannot use because shops don't carry particular item . system gives you flexibility but snatches it away requiring you not only get license but also find item . i can't help but feel hobbled license system . because these items ( which require licenses ) come discrete parts game , developers cunningly shot up difficulty . it doesn't matter i earned license " shield fire " level 4 , i only get it level 20+ when its offered shop ! game very challenging precisely because mechanics prevent characters getting better-than-normal equipment after they earned license . sly , artificial way developers ffxii ramped up difficulty strips away seems almost arbitrary unnecessary . cap three playable characters ( one time ) straw breaks camel back . lastly , battle system , my opinion , isn't fitting console rpg . it feels like i am playing world warcraft or city heroes . enemies always faster than you . it nigh impossible chase them down they always able catch up you . fighting bow exercise futility : enemies catch you because game freezes you place during firing . r2 button , which allows you flee , borders useless outright deadly use . while fleeing , game prevents you interacting objects . so if you flee toward door , you stop , pause , let them hit you , before you escape . my mouth gaped open when i saw reviews game online . this game received astronomical scores , some heralding it best final fantasy ever . shocks me beyond belief . ffxii would better mmorpg even sharper two-player rpg . single-player game , shoddy a.i mechanics , game plays like tumbling rock . perhaps i am just too old school , but this game tastes too much like lollipops bubblegum . your mileage may vary .	1
i bought this product after reading you update code list via network connection , or using usb flash drive . i not able get either work correctly . after following their instructions datel website how update codes using usb drive , it deleted my game saves memory card . it also corrupted memory card , corrupted saves card slot 2 . i nothing but trouble it , it slow doesn't live up promises . their customer support lousy , response merely said ... sorry . well thanks lot them ... just lost hours game saves !!	-1

i'm going start this review saying i came wii lifetime pc-only gamer . i never felt need buy console until wii its fun controller system came out . aspect i most excited controlling first person shooters just precisely intuitively mouse keyboard , together added entertainment using it other motion-activated actions within game ( rowing , throwing grenades , close combat , etc ) . result , after spending night out cold get my console , flushed excitement seeing all merchandise , i grabbed three games : zelda ( no-brainer ) , trauma center , call duty 3 . those three titles , i'm sorry say cod 3 one leave bitter taste my mouth . i stated before , i am pc gamer ; i'm really into my hobby , love satisfaction building pc which manage all latest games . i played cod 1 2 pc , greatly enjoyed both . far biggest problem wii version , however , especially someone accustomed playing computer , graphical shortcomings title . i literally no idea what going . i could barely tell which direction enemies coming only reason why i going right direction because linear construction most levels . added this , i no idea how get rid first german engage me hand hand combat ( much advertised feature , which actually just interactive cut-scene ) . i followed instructions wave my controllers around wildly , although i worked myself into frenzy ( causing my dogs panic think something really attacking me ) inevitable german ( i tried throwing all my grenades into room he hides ) kept clubbing me death . even beyond this setback , i found controls often quite poorly implemented . it also disappointing ( yet speaks volumes ) grenade ' throwing ' function involves you actually ' throwing ' nunchuck ( without letting go , way , unless you've got backup tv ) disabled default ; trying use it usually gets you miss your target/get cut down/ blow yourself up . record , i know wii controller works . i've played many hours other games already ( system conveniently informs you ) . this just seems like shoddy implementation it . i definitely tell you there lot ambition here convey frenzy war , some obvious strong attempts creating absorbing combat scenes . nevertheless , it essentially boils down messy soup blurry pixels which , even my gameplay-over-graphics mentality buying wii , blocks enjoyability this title . honest , it made me think ww2 isn't best-suited area wii . after all , these historical titles tend rely great deal cinematically portraying visceral splendor war , rather then pushing exciting new gameplay elements . my advice fps front : wait wii ' far cry ' game see how turns out . meantime , there countless hours other great titles more suited wii graphics waiting your attention . before leaving you , i'd just like clarify thing : this perspective someone who very little experience consoles . perhaps you're reaction game very different if you come wii straight gamecube instead pc/high definition gaming . oh , if you're still determined buy it , keep eye out my used copy game ; i'm going need money ' banana blitz ' ..	1

main appeal grand theft auto franchise always freedom it gives player explore vast amounts territory cause mayhem he sees fit . san andreas contains far most audacious expansion landmass available you . this time action takes place california inspired locales such los santos , san fierro las vegas inspired las venturas , all within enormous state san andreas . main inspiration this time around fascination ghetto culture so predominant early 90 . this provides great opportunity rockstar take advantage setting implement some new challenges player conquer . new grand theft auto concept territory control , member street gang player opportunity take over every available territory los santos later game . perhaps most notable additions franchise ability customize your character appearance improve his varied skills throughout game . these may seem like rather superficial additions but they surprisingly satisfying when implemented properly . character skill growth happens naturally rarely interferes freeform exploration players come expect series . customization your avatar varies greatly encompasses most fashion styles found during early `90s california . lower tier stores offer usual assortment baggy pants sports jerseys while more expensive stores offer suits , expensive jewelry trendy fashions . your characters appearance varied you want it it not stop just clothes tattoos , his physical fitness also changed . grand theft auto franchise improved almost all aspects each subsequent release this one proves no different . last game series use this outdated engine it pushes it far it go terms graphical prowess . graphics slightly improved over previous installment but they remain sub par standard featured most games released around same time . nonetheless visuals quite effective sunsets fill san andreas orange tint game color palette faithfully replicates feel early nineties california culture . soundtrack aptly replicates time period which san andreas draws its visual style perhaps one complaint this subject would rockstar seems try encompass far too many genres music . expected genres found , such hip-hop alternative rock , both which strong presence early nineties pop scene . however , some stations seem oddly out place game world era . dance music funk each get their own stations yet it hardly seems worth it , although too much choice never bad thing . making welcomed return various radio station djs , who each pepper time tracks hilarious chat amusing observations . those would prefer listen nothing but banter there two radio stations talk radio format , one public station holding discussions day political events light talk shows . either one these stations more than enough keep player amused hours but just case pc version gives you added bonus playing your own mp3 tracks adding them game music library . sound effects themselves seem appropriate but never particularly impressive . there usual banter among pedestrians complaints motorists you pull them out their vehicle run off their ride . all these things add little bit life game large cities voice work varies enough cover all different geographical areas san andreas contains . thick southern accents countryside inhabitants snobbish tone civilians rich neighborhoods all present . gunfire explosions sound average , not much improvement present since vice city . despite controversy seems follow every release series san andreas praiseworthy title itself . engrossing action game continues expand its limits while continuing deliver what fans series come expect	1

after finishing both " half life episode i " " chronicles riddick : escape butcher bay " over few days , i looking fun first person shooter game would let me pass away hour or so day , allow me unwind slaughtering constant flow enemies high powered weapons without resulting actual murder innocent people . i'd heard " far cry " pretty good , so i bought it , installed it got ready blas t.t he first thing i noticed astonishing graphics engine . it without doubt most beautiful environment ever created fps . my jaw floor first few hours , checking out ridiculously high detailed environment . outdoor scenery looks like paradise holiday destination crystal clear blue water lush green jungle . there birdlife , fish general feeling you're running around living , breathing world . one thing very different right start would play major role later missions . there no save game option ! there checkpoints littered around levels , but it occasionally around 10 20 minutes solid game-play them . first this just annoyed me since i found myself reloading over over some harder missions . i couldn't just run into fray , firing my weapon left , right centre anything moves because one headshot would send me back heck long way some instances . i forced change my style play all out assault , stealthy , crawling , breath-holding , sweating , nerve wracking approach . i rediscovered part myself loved " thief : dark project " so very much all those years ago . yet i still got combine approach levels general carnage when it simply unavoidable . i am now firm believer save game option should removed many other ( not all ) first person games out there it raises intensity level dramatically . story itself fairly average dialogue even more so , which really what places " far cry " below likes " half life " . you basically just following instructions entire game , used violent killing machine no real choices . but some reason , i just didn't care i so absorbed surroundings simply surviving it didn't lower my enjoyment . enemies very good ai , flanking me whenever possible generally actually trying avoid shot rather than running straight me . there plenty occasions though where enemy just stand there distance while you shoot them plain sight , but generally all good . weapons fantastic both highly effective satisfying use . sniper rifle always personal favourite this game makes awesome use it , massive maps open ground . while initially i prepared standard " serious sam " type game , " far cry " turned out so much more . some fantastic graphics , inspired level design , forced variations play some fiercely intense gunfights make this game absolute winner . you add value money well since there 20 long missions get through . no save option , those 20 take you long time complete . but you love it ! i sure	1
i really enjoy top down side scrolling shooters , so take this opinion mind . only problem r-type dying sucks . when you die you restart usually bad position without any powerups . once you unlock free-play this make game frustrating when you playing new stages or playing different ship etc . however overall i think it best r-types one better side scrollers out there .	1

my television completely different part my house my high speed internet connection , so while i wasn't thrilled dish out extra money this adapter , i say it completely worth it . since i figured out how set up my home wireless network coordinate 360 , i get very strong connection no problems staying connected . only issue i when i first set up adapter i didn't known enough wireless networks everything clicking together . first 360 would access xbox live , but using other nearby wireless networks because i not give 360 password id access my linksys router . i live center city philadelphia , default adapter picking up using whatever open wireless networks available . range must good , because it would register six or seven other networks varying strengths . once i figured out my linksys router password code ( i think it wep number ) i able punch router id into 360 360 then automatically connected secure wireless router my home . i never single issue since . i don't think this delay optimal setup anyone fault but my own , since i pretty ignorant how wireless networks set up but i feeling it may happen others . all all , i think secure wireless network home what become standard next few years . this adapter works great , small disappears behind console , reduces clutter wires , allows you keep your computer high speed connection separate distinct your television area . it definitely worthy purchase	1

castlevania : curse darkness game even die-hard castlevania fan might not much get into . lament innocence wasn't terrible game , but it wasn't great . curse darkness just goes show when 3d castlevania game marches forth , it problems . sometimes scary problems . like lament innocence , it so much potential good -- this title more so . but it doesn't deliver , that sad revelation admit , especially after so much enjoyment ds smash : dawn sorrow . ever since 1997 all time best , symphony night , so many main characters series like alucard some way . hector curse darkness no exception . he looks little like alucard . but we're not here discuss . hector devil forgemaster , one who given up his powers . dracula dead , but land overun curse monsters world valachia . hector , however , isn't concerned what kind shape world . he more concerned evil devil forgemaster name issac , who killed his beloved . if you couldn't guess , it time revenge . so issac leads hector into place full traps obstacles he must overcome . doing so , hector slowly recover his devil forgemaster skills whatnot . story actually unfolds excellent voice-acting , but there isn't much story . since symphony night we've given this metroid style exploration when it comes castlevania . this marvelous , once again , makes its way into 3d world castlevania . you explore large castle riddled goodies . this includes weapons , subweapons , armor much more . playing game quite fun . most game , you might guessed , spent running through endless hallways defeating monsters . isn't boring you might think . you perform some cool looking combos enemies , but each one must finished button . you also lock onto enemies perform combos . this makes camera go crazy , though , but this forgiveable . battling without locking actually much better , it isn't too hard without . although , if you want steal your enemies , you'll lcok ' em . speaking stealing , it nice you actually . many time monster leave himself open stealing . this usually occurs while it recovers taking damage . again , you must locked it happen . likewise , unlike lament innocence , they actually use level up system . other words , there actually point battling through hordes monsters this time . you also little helper monsters . you compare them familiars found other castlevania games ( like symphony night dawn sorror ) , but better comparison would pokemon . they lend their assistance gain experience defeating enemies , just you . it nice not go it alone , but we castlevania veterans would prefer go it alone . each enemy also drops evolution crystals . collect enough them your monster evolve . you won't grow like them , though . that sad part , they don't really enhance gameplay . monsters special abilities , though . golem like creatures open heavy doors , imps let you bury underground . but you can't help but admit it would nice if your little innocent devils actually characters . also , no evolution crystal same . you take advantage system collecting different types crystals seeing how your little buddies evolve . one nice things devil forger , you make your own weapons ! hector it any time he wants ! that right , no running back some stupid shop it ! monsters often drop raw materials , you use them make new weapons or make your current weapons stronger . you this simply opening menu . i don't know you , but that pretty satisfying me able tha t.t he weapons their own little downside however . exception sword , none them highly helpful combat . you start game off short sword , you'll grow accustomed its fast speed easy use . other weapons just aren't fast enough , enemies aren't weak certain weapon " type " . this makes weapon crafting system little useless some points . unless you're person who likes use " cool " looking weapons opposed swift powerful weapons , you won't much use weapon crafting system , except power up your sword . thus , experimenting weapons garners no fun . it pretty cool , i must say , venturing somewhere isn't dracula castle . instead you actually venture through world valachia . meaning you'll trek through swamps , mountains , valleys lot more . so if you're tired dracula castle , this quite change . problem this " world " you don't see enough it . there not enough detail it . you follow beaten path ( so it isn't really different than dracula castle lament innocence ) , so you can't go off just explore places you're . game also suffers what lament innocence suffered : lack detailed enviroments . you'll no doubt run down same path/hall/corridor several times over . if it weren't map you'd find yourself lost , thinking you must one those " looping " ares , or you took wrong turn ended up running circle . monsters also not so great . what i love 2d castlevania games ( especially new dawn sorrow ) how much variety thrown into monsters . attacks they use you . even if they're same looking monster , they throw some new attack you don't expect . curse darkness ( like lament innocence ) no variety . you'll run into same batch monsters constantly , they'll never something new . later game you'll find yourself fighting nothing but reincarnates different colored monsters nothing new . likewise , all monsters you'll ever see encountered pretty early . moment you run into axe armor , you've run into ' em all ! they'll never change . i sound like i'm picky enemies thing , but i'm not . it takes away challenge game . fact reincarnates don't anything new makes it more true . that not worst part : game overall just isn't challenge . bosses , times , but if you've playing 3d action games , i think you'll find even more challenging bosses no challenge all . early boss battles game fairly easy . later , however , they get start get hard , that when battling them actually becomes fun . again , though , if you're action/adventure pro , you'll probably beat most them your first try . i wish i could say graphics great . hey , hector looks great combat . but enviroments don't enough detail . too many them simple everyday enviroments we've seeing long time now . where detail ? you know ... like ... maybe leaves tree moving ? we're point where there could some kind interation enviroment , instead it seeming like we're running through still-life painting . visually , it doesn't look half bad . it just there could so much more . bosses look cool , framerate doesn't slow down all , but there isn't enough variety , or detail . however , i must say this : music sounds aweseome ! usual , castlevania games some best music there heard gaming ! it better than symphony night ? no , it not . it isn't better than lament innocence either ( which also steller music ) , but it still among best you'll ever hear video game . likewise , voice acting actually really really good ! i just wish i could've heard more it ! curse darkness potential good game . but there lot things keep it down . it fairly fun game play , but it lacks innovation . you won't able separate it other action/adventure 3d games . it got nothing makes it stick out . if you must this game , however , i'd say wait price drop . if you're really looking good castlevania game , i'd suggest getting hold " dawn sorrow " . it much better game . good : +great music ! some best gaming ! +good weapon system+it pretty fun play+you steal enemies ! +great voice acting ! bad-little innovation-lack cutscenes advance story-too much game gets recycled too fas t-t oo easy-the game doesn't look bad , but there little imagination environments-not whole lot different enemies-it too easy-boring level designs ( not enough them)-you just can't help game almost no innovation ! it no different than your average action/adventure 3d gameget dawn sorrow , or one other 2d versions game . they seem fare so much better than this one . even die-hard fan castlevania admit this one rather bland	1

might little misleading -- battle mechanics almost exactly same those first game ( heck , most nippon ichi games , though this series , i think , best lot ) . part game absolutely delivers : - great classes . - good monsters , more consistent class sytem them . - excellent assortment items . - good variety levels . however , far story -- area which hour darkness solid -- this game falls its face . writing iffy , plot itself contrived , characters ( while certainly amusing ) predictable , it just leaves so much desired . if you're looking storyline you get involved , go back first game . if you're it gameplay , though , don't miss this one ! some class tweaks few added features , cursed memories worthy addition those who simply want monotonous level-up madness some us thrive . great 2d art mixed fun environments , hilarious quips item descriptions , engaging fights hundreds hours ( literally ) entertainment	1

fable much anticipated rpg promised 40-50 hours gamer action storyline complete control over life protagonist . we waited this game what seemed like lifetime build up game finally arrive almost more than rpg lovers could take , but it live up hype ? no , my fellow gamers . it hurts me so say it . while game promised deliver several hours stoyline play i shocked when i completed main storyline less than 20 hours . now , i'm not one doubt sacred words lionhead studios , so i dedicated 20 hours my life uncover different aspects gameplay , such getting married , changing outfits body types , becoming divinely evil or majestically good ( ect . ) , but it all just so linear ! paths set , storyline already thought out , character chosen , you weren't given enough keep interest going . i later dragged myself back game play storyline through again , though i admit i enjoyed game much more second time through , i just found myself not caring it all . too many options closed darn story just too short !! darker elements game simply addicting such colleseum , prison ( which i played over over over ) , story your sister , but it seems though people charge developing such side stories ( which we all so love !!! ) got little case a.d.d. now , i'm not saying avoid this game . it got just what some gamers may need get into rpg , but those us who expecting game completely pwn morrowind , well , let just move ... or wait better thought our sequal . * crosses fingers	1

i played through first halo really enjoyed single-player campaign . i never played multiplayer game until i bought halo 2 . let get this out way first : halo 2 multiplayer unparalleled . multitude multiplayer games ( capture flag , juggernaut , team vs . team , etc . ) dizzying variety terrains , there plenty keep halo fans busy blowing each other up . addition alien elites playable character spice things up . you also wield two weapons time , one each fist , providing combat option those gunslingers like their battles john woo-style . unfortunately , halo 2 single-player campaign not impressive . whit , alien covenant entire society based idea activating giant rings throughout universe ( known halos ) put them their journey spiritual evolution . reality halo weapon designed destroy flood , infestation aliens who turn human alien alike into vicious zombies . how you keep flood infecting every living thing ? why , utterly destroying every living thing universe course ! play alternates master chief alien elite known arbiter . this gives player both sides story , which interesting ... point . eventually , plot converges enough so two characters should really end up fighting each other . would something , if ai made you play through both battles opposite sides creating enemy uses your own moves . but instead , midway through battle universe , giant plant looks like audrey ii little shop horrors shows up . this planet , speaking jabba-esque guttural tones , rams plot down our throats grabbing arbiter master chief shoving them into opposite plot lines : arbiter ends up working humans , master chief ends up doing alien dirty work . then things really get going , just halo 2 hurtles towards final battle earth ... game ends . i should guessed something up when , during e3 interviews halo 3 , ceo bungee only this say : " you ready finish war ? " what he meant , " you ready finish game you thought you finishing halo 2 ? " you've probably noticed my review second installment pirates caribbean , i really , really , really hate movies games fail provide whole story . it doesn't matter this part two three-part series . writers developers obligation provide full story ; you create story beginning end even though it middle series , evidenced two towers . halo 2 improvement original , but it loses points weak campaign forces you play both sides , then throws talking plant clean up mess .	1
if you always wanted turn based strategy game fantasy setting no limits then dominions ii really only option out there . its not perferct but its darn good . story , if you really call it , world dominions once one god . one day he just wasn't there all sudden everybody their brother decided try apply his job . all these " pretender gods " kill off all other gods put their religions out commision order take over world become true god . start up new game dominions ii you need choose one 17 different empires then pick your pretender god dozens different avatars . you play darn near anything you imagine ordinary , like arch-mage , outrageously exotic , like fountain blood . every pretender god strengths weaknesses some may adept only one or two paths magic while others may learn many ease . you also pick castle set up your own " dominion " which effect your god his followers his religion spreads across world . but isn't all , you still haven't actually started game yet . next you create game picking one nearly dozen huge maps setting all game settings such victory conditions difficulty neutral provinces . lets not forget , you also choose which 17 empires playing if they human or ai players . game itself huge very few limits . your empires unique units may built any province which you built castle but every proince game also its own units may built there inculde many none empires usually access . plus units may equiped different armor weapons such there may well hundreds unique units game maybe even thousands different equipment varaitions . like pretender gods , units come huge array simple , like light infantry , wild , like werewoles vampires . combine fact there hundreds spells game research , hundreds magic items forge find , random events almost every turn , no two games ever end same way game nearly unlimited replyability . combat bit unsual . all units , order move around map or attack , assigned commander . commanders built same way you recruit normal units but they only lead so many men . however , you assign units under commander many squads you like each squad well commander himself issued specific order such casting spells , using ranged weapons or attacking certain foes battle field . downside all this you set up all this before hand during your turn . combat occours turns you no control over battle . its entirely up your units follow plan you laid out them . better or worse this system certainly original . but some things game really bother me . my biggest complaint game computer ai . its not thats its too stupid or too smart . its actually bit like terminator , it allways seems know where you sends wave after wave seemingly endless foes after you . it can't reasoned , it can't bargined it won't stop until one you dead . no diplomacy options units like spys , assassins scouts extremely rare expensive most games aginst ai just deteroiate into massive rushing attacks huge armies killing each other over over gods throwing spells each other turn after turn . problem game manual which huge but contains no information isn't easily available game . its same problem evil genius , manual awful all hints should hae manual hidden games loading screens . i hope you read fast . grapics obviously aren't exactly par half life 2 or doom 3 but they work , however i've got take issue music sound which downright awful . you better get used hearing same three music tracks over over . over all , dominions ii far best turn based fantasy game i've ever played . room improvement obviously here but this game should keep you occupied long time	1
i've fan prince persia series since i little kid . pop 1 great , pop 2 absolutely unreal . pop 3d ehhh .... but then two years ago , came game changed everything . " prince persia sands time , " first game this amazing adventure game trilogy took everyone breath away . gameplay original , flawless , beautiful . storyline sucked you didn't let you go even after you'd beaten it 6 times over . it flawless game . last year , first sequel , " prince persia warrior within , " released . while game contained improvements quality graphics " freeform fighting " techniques , game less pleasing both critics gamers . ubisoft turned humrous , witty , intelligent prince " sands " into angry , nu-metal-rocking , humorlous scoundrel who seemed hellbent ruining everyone time . while story equally engaging " sands , " " warrior " failed because it simply not much fun play . luckily , ubisoft saved best last . " two thrones " easily one greatest games i ever played . concluding one greatet videogame trilogies ever created , ubisoft developed near flawless game . it though they took strengths both games , removed weaknesses second game , created thing pure brilliance . " two thrones " contains all witty , punning elements first game mixes them exciting , more violent elements second game while removing everying ruined prince demeanor second game . original , fun , saracastic prince back , largely because ubisoft also brought back one things made " sands " so great : farrah . farrah perfect foil our hero . she adds humor , power , creativity , definitely sexiness game " warrior " lacking . farrah relationship prince far my favorite relationship i've ever " played " videogame ubisoft deserves big brownie points bringing her back . gameplay " two thrones " amazing . throughout game , gamer occassionally forced play " dark prince " there situations where " normal , " original prince unable get through . other games , playing two characters often appeared more gimmick than actual , integral part story , but " two thrones , " reasoning behind prince frequent changing prince dark prince back again very well explained very important overall story " two thrones telling . " fight scenes epicly fun play . this prince more moves than he two last games combined his battle techniques joy use . new " speed kill " method killing some opponents adds certain amount skill brutality many fights otherwise would seemed boring taken far too long complete . i welcomed addition speed kills once i fully learned how use them . prince still moves acrobatically ever . there still wall-running , jumping , flipping , handsprings , etc .... only real notable movement difference when gamer plays dark prince . dark prince chain/weapon/thing used grab onto bars away or objects would otherwise out reach prince then swing over them . it not different anything prince before but it definitely fun worked well flow game . all all i rate this best new sands pop trilogy . it awesome game should played anyone who ever enjoyed 3rd person adventure game . if you haven't played either one first two games warned : storyline actually rather complex you missing much story if you haven't played first two games . if you played first two games , this story terrific conclusion prince tale , way it wraps around back beginning trilogy floored me when i finished it . buy this game . ( something worth noting ... after you beat game you unlock many videos , chief among these " alternate/real ending " warrior within formerly only available if you beat warrior after collecting all life upgrades .... so if you beat warrior without all life upgrades didn't see " real " ending ... beating this game shows it you video collection )	1
i honestly hate fighting games . i think they're boring they don't offer anything interesting keep me attached them years go . enter tekken . tekken around many years . when it first came out , everyone loved it . it used compete virtua fighter sega saturn . i impressed then i'm impressed now , all these years later . action just lot fun . you really couldn't ask better fighting game . graphic updates really added more depth characters environments . i love game i hope you , well	1

i very much enjoyed this game i think it may my favorite x-box game i own ! i kinda agree person said this game pretty short , but it not make it any less better ! one funny part this game part where you sunny first time game jump each pipe whole time she just sitting there laughing her head off ! i reccomend this game people like games fun , educational , very durable	1
simply put , xenogears + xenosaga 1 absolute best storyline , best role playing experience ps2 date . i strongly believe xenosaga 2 best storyline any rpg i ever , ever played , including final fantasy 7 , xenogears , hundreds others . because rpgs strongly reliant storyline gameplay , i consider this pinnacle role playing ps2 . final fantasy comes close , star ocean , but terms storyline , this game beats them . however , i mark down few other minor flaws . this game highly niche game , only those who enjoy style , sci fi setting . it also very short ..... 20 hours if you play straight through ( no leveling up ) . maybe 38-42 hours if you take up side-quests want strong character . gameplay : first xenosaga highly relied cut scenes narrative . fact , i absolutely could not stand battle system . xenosaga episode 2 still relies heavily upon storytelling through hours cut scenes , but it fixes battle system . battle system , simply put , one most fun turn-based systems i ever experienced . while xenosaga episode 1 battle system seemed slow unwieldy , episode 2 fast paced , action packed , highly challenging battle system . you 3 characters screen just all times , these characters switched off manner much like ffx , but it costs turn this game , causing it more tactical . each turn you many options ; you attack ( more various attacks later ) , stock ( save turn next turn order get combo ) , use ether ( read : magic ) , or change your battle party . if you choose attack , there whole slew options here well . most importantly learning weak points enemy . every enemy , including bosses , certain attack combination most effective against them . when you attack , you press either square , which zone attack , triangle , which zone attack , or circle , which zone attack . certain characters also zone attack , but this only against flying opponents . you must expierament enemies order learn zones they weakest . sometimes , you may required ' stock ' turn order attack enemy its weak zone . " what advantage attacking weak zones ? " you ask . well , it allows large scale , damage pounding comboes absolutely essential this game . once you hit all enemy weak zones , you " break " them . this involves circle button . once character ' broken ' , they tossed into air , or attacked while prone ground . this add up tons damage if you plan your boosting right . boosting integral part combat system . pressing r1 button brings up 3 slot meter which sometimes empty , but it may feature character potraits some your characters . if you press r1 , then button ( square , triangle , or circle ) character potrait , they boost forward , immediately after acting unit taken its turn , this new character turn . enemies , however , take advantage all these systems well . if you not plan well , or randomly attack without comboes , enemy break you , boost ahead several times , easily destroy one your characters one short , brutal assault . countless times my entire party destroyed simple enemies should no problem , merely because i not plan ahead . you get very , very used seeing game over screen . plus side this difficulty you feel real exhiliration when you win , it great accomplishment . note even power levelling , it won't help you much some situations , believe me , i tried . finally , there ether . ether skills basically magic , if you know anything rpgs all , then you know basically what present here , healing ether skills , attack ether skills , nothing big . i forgot mention e.s. units . these basically mechs , called a.g.w.s. episode 1 . many points game involve you using these move around fight , now they independant battle system . it basically same one your characters screen , except you only one attack turn , no comboes or anything like . it just added piece fun already awesome game . there skill system place . after every battle you earn class pointss and/or skill points . these spent getting new ether skills , or new upgrades your characters make them more resilient when you equip them . every character same skill set , this minor flaw slightly brings down gameplay score , but not overall enjoyment least . finally , one other flaw gameplay there no weapons , no armor . both these rpg standard fare , it seems kind odd not either . this may just something developers decided not i disagree , but it still seems little odd . note this really not detract game any way . xenosaga 2 , they also opted add lot more puzzle solving than episode 1 . interesting thing these puzzles , while challenging , don't take away gameplay expierience all . fact , i found many very enjoyable . storyline this game simply incredible . but , keep mind it basically required you beaten xenosaga episode 1 if you want understand it all , or least acquainted story some manner . if you haven't played it , best way get bonus dvd came game , there probably some somewhere around , maybe even ebay , allows you see 4 hours cut scenes original . this substitute those who dont want spend 60-80 hours required xenosaga episode 1 beat it . anyway , i digress , xenosaga 2 storyline more space opera fun . often times i got very emotional , game tug your heartstrings . ending sequence game , spectacular event lasting 15 minutes , i seriously tears . this game you , storyline good . it also filled entrigue , betrayal , new discoveries , new secrets . it truly incredible . i seen certain reviews say storyline doesn't solve everything , it doesn't solve all mysteries . let me tell you something : it not supposed . xenosaga going 4-8 part series , storyline continuous . it makes no sense all story complete only episode ii . i see no reason why anyone could possibly complain it . graphics : graphics xenosaga 2 basically same they episode 1 . no real improvements all . they still great though , cut scenes gorgeous . my one real complaint here lip sync sometimes off ( problem just every rpg voice overs ) , some environments little dull . this made up environments simply breathtaking . sound : soundtrack xenosaga episode 2 godlike . opening theme battle music catchy japanese sounding tunes ring your head forever , this music incredible . voice acting also absolutely superb , i zero complaints , this rarity . sound effects also very appropriate , very well . value : game hurt value department only because its length . put it perspective , first playthrough took me 28 hours , but more like 30 if you count all times i died go back point i got killed . after you win , you use your game clear file access even more goodies like some bonus bosses , dungeons , side quests , this helps make up shorter length . personally , i think its best $50 i ever spen t.t ilt : finally , overall enjoyment . this game simply most enjoyable game i played ps2 . i completed it after several all-night gaming sessions , it most likely keep you up too . role playing experience here superb , storyline possibly best rpg history , battle system incredible depth . there virtually nothing not like . avid rpg gamer , i recommend this game highly possible . however , there few things consider : you handle challenge , you like space opera/anime feel ? if you answered yes both , get this game	1
i find this game very indepth when it comes ability change formations plays just what you see . however , my major disappointment comes graphics . i understand ps2 doesn't not standards xbox360 , but this false advertising showing this very detailed game not showing which system this ran . i just hope when ps3 comes out , madden rerelease game it give xbox360 owners something whine . ea should more infomational giving what things look like consumer rather then just showing best picture they	1
admittedly , i haven't played lot strategy rpgs . i attempted play final fantasy tactics , generally considered classic genre , one point , but i found it really dry i serious problems class system seems really unbalance game making it too easy . i've never really much motivation seek out other examples srpg genre because there nippon-ichi disgaea series , unique it fun . long-lasting too . you spend several hundred hours playing through disgaea : hour darkness disgaea 2 : cursed memories beat all bonus content beyond main campaign . disgaea 2 shines more polished version first disgaea . character sprites more vivid , spell effects more visual flare . music dialogue sharper audio quality . all bonus quests first disgaea expanded such inclusion dark court endless dungeon item world even more stuff dark assembly . however , it also so similar first game it feels almost like expansion pack rather than true sequel . story disgaea 2 similar first one , it highly character driven told quite bit humor . overlord zenon tranformed all residents world veldime into monsters . adell , last remaining human , embacks quest slay overlord rozalin , zenon haughty neglected daughter . way , they meet colorful cast enemies , rivals , allies they attempt crack mystery behind near-immortal zenon . it enjoyable story , if bit meandering . it one major susprise twist end caught me off guard though it probably shouldn't . combat , like most srpgs , takes place series grid-like maps , usually four chapter . characters move around so many squares per turn opportunity attack any enemies falls within their attack range . battlefields littered geo-panels , multicolored pyramids confer penalties bonuses certain areas maps . there dozens classes , both monster human , fashion powerful army out . choose wisely , because grand total 10 deployed any one time . unfortunately , experience points only go character deals final blow so level disparities characters combined steadily increasing difficulty curve make it neccesary replay some maps times . luckily , difficulty curve much more finely tuned this game , so you spend less time leveling up than first game . main campaign disgaea 2 pretty short , i clocked little over 30 hours my first play through , granted i barely touched much sidequests . i also found it little easy side . i didn't die once until i penultimate chapter . i don't know it because game easier or if it just spending over one hundred hours conquering first game . sprgs probably hardest sub-set out rpg genre . disgaea series highly recommended experienced inexperienced players alike . disgaea 2 many different systems enhance playing experience , but unlike many games , doesn't force player learn how work them all . players option playing game face value or learning all complex systems more enriched experience . this very accessable game , this genre definitely needs more games strike balance too hard or too easy .	1
i think this might one my favorites ff series . i think all characters awesome . their overdrives very cool too	1
incredible game , it very depth graphics great story line . beauty game there lot freedom character development . you choose good or evil , depending every action you take . game little too short but gameplay graphics make up it . this must buy anybody xbox	1

i love this game i bought this game 3 times	1
this video game recommended me my 19 yr . old son , my 7 yr . old son . it great hit , my 7 yr . old loves it my other sons ( ages 19 22 ) enjoy it also . very entertaining , well worth money	1
one thing kotor 2 greatly impressed me how obsidian , taking kotor franchise over bioware , not mess winning formula . they faithfully carried over first game visual style , presentation , atmosphere , which means those who played kotor 1 jump right . just like kotor 1 , game hinges its story rather than fancy gimmicks or better graphics or more features . kotor 2 storyline runs parallel kotor 1 , introduces new protagonist whose only tie first game he/she fought mandalorian wars . again , characters bit flat/stereotypical , most talking throughout game ( you mostly choose how you'll respond others through your dialogue choices ) . main reason why i would actually rate this game higher - yes , higher - than kotor 1 intelligence script . what i mean how game characters challenge you ( both main character person playing game ) think long hard some things regarded " truths . " yes , i'm talking some serious philosophy here . example , kreia , one your allies , challenges you think how random act kindness actually robs person that helped chance struggle , fight , become stronger it . jedi master challenge you think what if cause you believed strongly ends up doing just much harm it prevents . instance game shows dangers both blind allegiance independent thought ( yes , latter also dangers ) . best part all this presented within context game various scenarios , without ever sounding preachy . far gameplay mechanics concerned , obsidian spiced up battle interface new force powers feats , which open up new dimension strategizing outfitting your party . unfortunately it seems all bugs glitches first game carried over well , such " doorway bug " " menu bug . " playing pazaak still just hard . nod those who played first game , obsidian decided insert many references kotor 1 here there . example , kotor 2 recycles two planets first game , dantooine korriban . maps identical ones first game , but this time you explore slightly different parts planets . people game constantly referring mandalorian wars ( war fought five years before kotor 1 timeline ) jedi civil war ( events kotor 1 ) . fact , you'll find jedi civil war casts very large shadow over lives many people you'll encounter game , including most your allies . you'll find played first game certainly enriches this one , although it not crucial . so , summary , if you're suffering post-kotor withdrawal symptoms , your prayer answered - go buy this game now	1
i enjoyed most aspects this game it quickly becaming addicting . there great satisfaction beating people up plenty opportunity fine tune my skills . overall though , this game definately easy side . compared grand theft auto games , which i never able complete , i finished this one just over week . final challenge particularly simple i really expected more . still , i'd recommened this game , however rent it , don't buy	1
xbox version this game way better . one , graphics enhanced , not crappy like ps2 version . second all loading time processing time literally cut half . so dont buy this version , suck it up buy xbox . oh if this game bores you , you either weren't using cheats or u havent played missions atleast through los santos	1
i owned xbox over 3 years now it really best gaming machine last generation . mine worked perfectly , i love music soundtracks where you load your own cds unto hard drive play them instead certian game sountracks . game selection much better xbox graphics . you get halo , project gotham racing 2 , midtown madness 3 ( must fun game ) , xbox live . i used my xbox play dvds media center extender ( purchase $25 kit comes remote ) it works well , no fumbling your controller like ps2 , just simple remote !	1
i recently picked this game up because laptop i purchased college finally computer powerful enough run it . it easily one best computer games i've ever played . playing world massive ( you literally walk any mountain or monument you see distance ) there multiple ways accomplish goal and/or solve mission . basic plot this : you jack carver , who accompanied woman part micronesia undisclosed reasons ( she turns out cia agent ) , before long she kidnapped , you fighting your life against army well-trained mercenaries . it fairly generic shooter plot , but it gets point across ties everything together well . enemy ai unbelievably good . soldiers work together take you down ( all while dropping hilariously bad one-liners like " how you like those apples ?? " , " right eyes , mofo ! " , " i'm gonna tear you new one !! " ) . shootouts result this game blast : you really get good cover strategize your fight . it first shooter i've played makes me feel like i'm actually action movie . vehicles one game biggest highlights . if you want move quicker downstream , you snipe occupants frequent patrol boats water steal their ride . you often obtain rvs atvs ( one point game , forklift reasons unknown ) . these blast you drive right through enemies firing you . one thing i enjoy doing driving full speed enemy bailing out last second . always good fun . game also great challenge . i just completed game medium setting it still almost impossible places . fighting trigens ( small monkey-like creatures claws ) nightmare any diffculty , they outrun outjump you kill you , often , single hit ( i strongly suggest using sniper rifle or powerful machine gun other than m4 them long distance before they really mess you up ! )in short , this best fps i ever played , probably one best computer games ever made overall . highly recommended . ( side note : not it matters me , but i'm personally surprised this game got mature rating ... there barely any blood all , none it sticks floor . when shot rocket launcher , people don't explode like normally mature-rated shooters . this game should rated teen )	1
this particularly good game our younger kids , though our 9 year old able finish entire game weekend . our 7 year old continues enjoy it without same degree frustration he experiences some other games bit too old him . this game great even though kids not seen movie	1
i just bought this game last month , played all way through it , including unlockable side quests . i'm not going write much games story here , there plenty other reviews already . all i'm going write game itself . anyway , after playing all way through game , i say i like it even more than original . script much better , music sounds much better gba . one thing i particularly liked this game all new unlockables ! after beating game , you unlock new dungeon explore , well really cool music player ! if you go down extra select " music player " main menu , you listen all tunes melodies you heard throughout game ! my personal favorites include , hey cid !, rydia , theme love , chocobo-chocobo , dancing calcobrena . unlockable dungeon , lunar ruins , very cool ! fully unlock every room dungeon , you beat zeromus once each character . after , you get some really cool extra tasks each character ! i wont spoil them you , but just them game highly increases overall replay value this game . now pros cons this remake ... pros:it same old game you used love , but some cool upgrades additions game play . new quick save feature allows you save inside dugeons towns . some text old game fixed so now all magic spells aren't abreviated . example : meteo fixed read meteor . new unlockable music player side quest dungeon ! music sounds much sharper gba , you really hear seperate instruments playing unison . this version old , unedited script , which far more convincing durring game play . cons : unlike final fantasy chronicles , this game not include chrono trigger . they changed sound effects some moves , changed names some moves . example , meteor doesnt make screechy noise anymore , ( which i thought sounded cool ) nuke changed flare . battle , there seems lag reaction time when pressing down buttons ... ( you press button , but it takes second register command . ) 50/50 : none graphics upgraded , but if you're like me , doesnt really matter . if you're like me , already played final fantasy ii snes or final fantasy chronicles psone , buy this game ! it well worth price	1
if you " mechassault " xbox live gamer tag try playing me ! i usually play capture flag my gamer tag " minor00 " so if you see me sure challenge me game because this game rocks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
scarface world yours ( vivendi games ) one most hyped videos games 2006 . following success godfather game , people couldn't wait get their hands scarface game especially when some reviewers said it good or better than grand theft auto games . game takes what if scenario , i.e. , what if tony montana didn't die end scarface but instead loses everything rebuild his empire . first i start off important matter -- player control movement . comparison past vivendi/universal games i say player control movement very good . next up weapons . i personally felt like aim shooting ability could vastly improved . according tutorial you press l1 target r1 shoot but they failed mention you must use analog stick aim your weapon . maybe you don't , maybe it just me , this isn't instructions but i found more success when i used analog stick conjunction l1 r1 . game begins you your mansion facing hail gunfire enemies . top your balcony you must shoot enemies . then came my first moment " oh this isn't much free world grand theft auto , " when i tried descend left side staircase i couldn't get down it . it like there invisible forcefield . perhaps you need kill certain amount enemies before you descend down left stairs . i made my kills then descended down right side staircase take remainder enemies . there function named blind rage comes out when you press button controller . this function makes tony temporarily invincible . when he dies , screen it says " you f*cked up . " just one example cursing game . word used so much this game adult i wish there would filter change language setting . i literally play game mute because all foul language . scarface-the world yours fun game if you like violent games . i point out gamer rock star games spoiled us terribly . scarface-the world yours you pretty much stay mission or there isn't much . past five years grand theft auto series given us ability perform street races , visit shooting range , import vehicles , gamble , dance , work out , or just walk around mess things up when we aren't mission . scarface-the world yours you basically stay mission . there isn't too much extra when you aren't mission . sometimes game player i get tired shooting so much just want take break something different . i strongly suggest buying prima games strategy guide . it definitely unlocks full potential game . scarface-the world yours overall fun game , but it still doesn't give game player total free open world experience some gta games . but yeah , get strategy guide , it gives player something look forward .	1
plz stop doing reviews over how bad it few options , cuz it just simply isn't way . yo fire flaming people catapults or let you creature throw flaming guy middle army so middle army willl fire . you just need creative . think like what happen if i teach my creature pick up army guy set him fire than throw middle thightly builded city . this game many options , but you'll create these options . this wasn't really review but comment other reviews who saying boring dull etc . this game you make it fun your imagination	1

i no longer play video games ( though i recently started back computergames ) but i review this great set . you get two games : fianl fantasy 5 , final fantasy 6 . first , let us look ff5 . ff5 never released states officialy but squaresoft ( now called squareenix ) unleashed it upon us all . it story isn't greatest but it not story here ; it all gameplay . this main reason this my favourite series . job class indepth gives you lot options here . this improves upon already great job class ff3 ( not ff6 ) only comes insecond job class system found dragon warrior 3 dragon warrior 7 . i also like size if this game , there three different worlds here they all good size . i also love main villian name , x-death , his final form name , neo x-death . there lot more good things make this game great but i'll let you discover them . ff6 also solid game introduced some things would found later ff games . one thing indepth stories multiple characters play . even though lot fans like say ff7 got best villian series , i many others dissagree . kefka jst pure evil incarnate . i'm not going into details so you yourself find all little things make him such awesome bad guy he . it just great game . if you don't mind 2-d graphics , old games , then yourself favoure get this fine set now	1
this great game which yoiu get caught up action . it almost if " you there "	1

parents : content this game seems absolutally fine anyone roughly ten up . only reason i see it rated teen because this game requires good bit hand eye cordination sometimes . aslo hulk roaring might get little kids who still around age where they still come up you middle night check there closets monsters , but basicly if your kids handel action cartoons like ninja turtles justice league they deffinately handel this game . anyways ... i wasn't sure this game when i picked it up . i don't know why , i hadn't heard much it i hadn't played many comic book based games besides spiderman based one playstation . but i didn't see many other games rental store kids could play my xbox so i rented it out see if it okay . it , my opinion , absolutaly great game almost anyone . entire game like digital stress ball me , you get rampage your hearts desire . i spent few hours alone week just ignoring story chapters completely just wrecking huge city desert military bases game takes place . kids would also love it same reason they build lego houses then smash them bits their action figures . story bit odd if you don't know much hulk already it revolves around bruces quest cure order stop second more evil cunning hulk bruce banner discoverted growing inside him appropriatly named devil hulk . big green savage hulk we all know love also doesn't like devil hulk moving banner mind , so it becomes more agreeable suconicous orders banner uses get child-like brute what he wants . meanwhile new baddie called abomination appears after one military general stupidly trys recover one bruce failed " cure " attempts very begining game . all all story okay you go , but you tell they tried stuff several comicbooks basic ideas into game story only excuse callenge you bosses other unique situations . far gameplay goes , it fantasic . more damage you cause , more smash points you earn more moves you buy later too continue your assult just everything . there mini games secrets everywhere earn even more smash points . fact , only thing that missing o-o or two player mode . far replayability goes , it always there . anyway , i would recommended this game a)anyone who kids roughly around ten , ) anyone who likes third person , single player games ) anyone one who stress out work one too many times or feels like throwing temper tantrum :)	1

i'm not going into storyline , becuase it obivously spoil it those who haven't oppurtunity play this excellent game . final fantasy first game final fantasy series released playstation 2 . graphics here sharp crisp , no fuzzness or distortions . voice actors actually good job , doesn't sound like those old kung-fu movies where tone voices ] don't match person appearnace . battle system simple use they offer tutorials within menu case you're still confused . i'm really pleased results i see myself playing this game over over again	1

gameplay overall feel this game screams castlevania . sidescrolling platform action spot , graphics truly push limits ds , variety equipment/soul combinations lend itself perfectly creating gameplay experience perfect your style play . people said past reviews , use touch screen feels tacked . defeat bosses you draw symbols screen , which frustrating if ) you poor penmenship , or ) left-handed ( such yours truly ) scramble take stylus out , switch it your other hand , draw symbol . it neat little addition but , again , it didn't really need there . also , boss battles sometimes little too easy , even later levels . don't get me wrong , there some just downright nasty , but some bosses fire off their special weapon all you look screen go " ... that it ? " overall , this great game nintendo ds . exception clunky touch screen addon , game overall fantastic	1

when i first played this game i shocked . just how good stealth game could actually . its realistic its ways you hide shadows use enviroment take out your enemies . its really fun also , suspense one main things happens this game . you only use two guns during whole game , pistol rifle attachments . good stuff . all you need , you take out whole building full enemies . you crouch , move slowly so enemy doesnt see you . very realistic game im happy this series games got released . i highly recommend this game . great storyline , last level hecka hard !	1

main appeal grand theft auto franchise always freedom it gives player explore vast amounts territory cause mayhem he sees fit . san andreas contains far most audacious expansion landmass available you . this time action takes place california inspired locales such los santos , san fierro las vegas inspired las venturas , all within enormous state san andreas . main inspiration this time around fascination ghetto culture so predominant early 90 . this provides great opportunity rockstar take advantage setting implement some new challenges player conquer . new grand theft auto concept territory control , member street gang player opportunity take over every available territory los santos later game . perhaps most notable additions franchise ability customize your character appearance improve his varied skills throughout game . these may seem like rather superficial additions but they surprisingly satisfying when implemented properly . character skill growth happens naturally rarely interferes freeform exploration players come expect series . customization your avatar varies greatly encompasses most fashion styles found during early `90s california . lower tier stores offer usual assortment baggy pants sports jerseys while more expensive stores offer suits , expensive jewelry trendy fashions . your characters appearance varied you want it it not stop just clothes tattoos , his physical fitness also changed . grand theft auto franchise improved almost all aspects each subsequent release this one proves no different . last game series use this outdated engine it pushes it far it go terms graphical prowess . graphics slightly improved over previous installment but they remain sub par standard featured most games released around same time . nonetheless visuals quite effective sunsets fill san andreas orange tint game color palette faithfully replicates feel early nineties california culture . soundtrack aptly replicates time period which san andreas draws its visual style perhaps one complaint this subject would rockstar seems try encompass far too many genres music . expected genres found , such hip-hop alternative rock , both which strong presence early nineties pop scene . however , some stations seem oddly out place game world era . dance music funk each get their own stations yet it hardly seems worth it , although too much choice never bad thing . making welcomed return various radio station djs , who each pepper time tracks hilarious chat amusing observations . those would prefer listen nothing but banter there two radio stations talk radio format , one public station holding discussions day political events light talk shows . either one these stations more than enough keep player amused hours but just case pc version gives you added bonus playing your own mp3 tracks adding them game music library . sound effects themselves seem appropriate but never particularly impressive . there usual banter among pedestrians complaints motorists you pull them out their vehicle run off their ride . all these things add little bit life game large cities voice work varies enough cover all different geographical areas san andreas contains . thick southern accents countryside inhabitants snobbish tone civilians rich neighborhoods all present . gunfire explosions sound average , not much improvement present since vice city . despite controversy seems follow every release series san andreas praiseworthy title itself . engrossing action game continues expand its limits while continuing deliver what fans series come expect	1
basketball aspect this game little more fun than nba live 2006 just because refs not constantly interupt gmaeplay . but graphic-wise , this game worst graphics than any other sprts game since 2003 , i'm talking ps2 version . but close-up graphics very good . my faveorite part game you even fantasy draft play now mode . but if you basketball fan you really should get this , it extremely fun	1
" creature kapu cave " nancy drew hardy boys work together solve mystery surrounding dying pineapple crops hawaii possible relation this top-secret scientific work nearby family who owns vacation excursion center . nancy there working entomologist ( bug scientist ) hardy boys hawaii some detective work family who runs excursion center . locals believe mytholocial creature angered therefore responsible dying crops - they right ? if not , who else could behind it why ? this nd game several new features . first , you go back forth playing both nancy drew hardy boys - each responsible different parts story . also , through use gps you drive wherever you need go . although i thought graphics great , i didn't like fact i couldn't stay any one area very long - once you 1 or 2 things you move place /or identity switch nancy hardy . because this , there wasn't too much explore any one place . overall , i really liked playing " creature kapu cave " - but i would enjoyed it more i able explore each area more wasn't forced move place place so quickly	1
these 2 games probably ( my opinion anyway ) best ones series . i review each game seperatly then make my comments collection itself . ff5 : one previously unreleased ff games ( time anyway ) now america . i really like choosing classes because it raise replay value through roof . i literally trained my characters ( this during beginning middle game ) get level 30 or 40 ( can't remember exactly ) just get my jobs mastered . storyline good well because unlike some other ff games , this one sticks one you need get rid ( x-death ) rather than fighting final battle against someone you no clue what makes character so evil why your fighting him/her instead one who destroying world . bad thing this game lack characters ( there only 5 entire game , you stick 4 , one them dies replaced his granddaughter ) so prepared look same 4 characters screen also not menu change characters . ff6 : i think this best one series . there absolutly no real " main " character this game . those who confused , what i mean , well example , ff7 you 9 characters but leader character cloud ( one you see control fields majority game ) , well this game you 4 different characters your party you ability put any character leader . characters excellent this game , i pretty much like all them ( gau funny , but he doesn't best abilities one secret characters you can't even control them all during battle ) . sabin blitz ability . those you who playing fighting games years pretty good understanding this but sadly when you make move , no matter which direction your facing , you still hae put same command same direction . instance , one moves rlr ( i am talking right left right control pad ) if your character facing right , then you insert command , but if you facing opposite direction , it still same command ( not opposite combination ) . when i first beat game , before beating it , i got all characters level 99 . this game also some best music ff game ( time anyway ) . collection itself : you get music cd , random battle screen like ff7 8 random battle loading screen , ff6 bonus menu looking stats enemies , cgi cinemas , ff5 pretty much like super nes ( or should i say super famicom ) version just exception random battle loading screens psone style opening cinema no extra bonuses because game never released usa square probably wanted people experience it without huge bunch bonus features . overall : if you like snes ff games , this right collection you ( chronicles which includes ff4 ( ff2 usa snes ) chrono trigger	1

there three things matter me when i sit down play game . ( 1 ) playability , ( 2 ) story , ( 3 ) graphics . this game excelled all three . ease directing my character choosing his moves so prominent felt so natural i just sort fell into my character role . few other rpg games , i didn't doubt second what i supposed move forward . story game deep riveting - but more importantly , sensible . this not just action game annoying , throw-away characters subplots go nowhere . you actually care characters involved you take keen interest what their future holds , even characters you only get see moment . ending especially well , it left me thinking where my character would go next , what he would , what path he would follow . even though i made his decisions throughout entire game , he still his own character - i simply shaped him bit . when i finally put controller down watched credits roll up screen , i heartbroken it over . but then i realized i could simply start all over again completely different character , end up completely different place . whole new experience . if you're anything like me , trust me when i say this game one kind . last , but certainly not least , graphics fantastic times breath-taking . graphics only work bring out story characters make universe game set all more believable . they never fail set tone whatever setting you find yourself . its predecessor , sith lords raised bar role-playing games . role-playing games , such final fantasy , while still enjoyable their own right , tend allow player almost no freedom all . sith lords allows astounding amount freedom . you literally go where you want , you what you want , however you want it . granted , it not grand theft auto , but then , gta not role-playing game . but while i am quick point out great aspects game , i most also point out bad . first major annoyance game continually froze i forced reset system start over . counter this problem , you'll forced save often different slots - game even warns you so . it not really big deal , but it get me little . second major annoyance my inability control all members my party proficiently - ai continally got me into trouble i could avoided . ( this one problems first knights old republic . ) other than , there nothing else worth mentioning . its predecessor , i hold this game highest esteem , eagerly look foward next ( if there one ) installment . enjoy game	1
