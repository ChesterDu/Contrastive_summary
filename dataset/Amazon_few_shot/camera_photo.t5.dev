hey this everyone buying cameras over world out united states , i problem my camera i don't anyone help , i've trying some help amazon help area but they just thousands links but any simple email where i ask some help , i don't really understand why this site so well known quot ; customer servicequot ; , but i just cannot communicate no one company ask anything , i'm just mad this , if anyone help me contact amazon or fujifilm please post email or whatever cause there no such thing like help quot ; help areaquot ; . i need repair my lcd monitor my camera , it really fragile , so if you're still thinking buying this site or even buying something fujifilm , don't it , they don't care customer satisfaction all	-1
this filter fine normal shooting , but if you low-light work , beware ; you see bad internal reflections night shots , need remove filter	-1
300mm this lens very soft , it hard get shot looks like it focus . so , you need shoot f/11 , then since there little light available , you usually bump iso 800 or 1600 just get acceptable shutter speed . course , high iso then introduces other artifacts . focus also dead slow often doesn't lock . this lens i constantly fought . don't upgrade new 70-300 either , it only marginally better . buy 70-200 f/4l . it far superior lens	-1
i bought this lens based super telephoto ability low cost . you truly get what you pay , this thing isn't worth plug nickel . i took few shots tripod could not believe how terrible this lens @ 300mm ( 480mm digital rebel xt ) . incredibly soft . even stopped down , i would never want make enlargement it . stay away . don't believe fools who novices , you disappointed this lens . you're much better off buy older used 100-300mm 5.6 ( version costs more too ) but both so much better than this junker . you're even more crazy if you think you take decent photo this lens handheld . switched nikon when switching digital , i almost judged canon this one lens , which i'm glad i didn't . don't waste your money or learn hard way like i . this lens also terrible purple fringing , almost bad kit 18-55mm . after extensive research testing i now own am happy following canon lenses : canon 10-22mmcanon 28-105mm ( 3.5 version)canon 100-300mm ( 5.6 non-l version ) i sell version when i afford it . kit 18-55mm makes usable shots , but when i could afford it , i sold it too . you get better results buying rebel xt older 100-300mm than you would brand new xti this terrible 75-300mm lens .	-1
i bought this lens pretty excited it , but i've disappointed . previous this i bought 50mm 1.8 $70 lens completely puts this one shame . i need wider angle lens went this one , but all too often found myself quite disappointed results . edges subjects all messy just looked terrible , even higher stops . i shoot 20d . usm awesome though sure option whatever lens i choose buy place this one . focal range 28-105 also very nice , but me picture quality not so good	-1
great idea poorly executed . construction cheap . screen marginal best . but worst all , it refuses recognize any 3 digital cameras i hand or usb card reader . piece junk i am now returnin	-1
i agree . arse 2star rating . i disappointed this camera beginning . not user friendly one pictures turn out very grainy bad color quality unless you optimum light . i'm interested 7 mp camera canon offers . i've read it much better shutter speed . recommended ??	-1
i am fascinated this machine . it incredible detail although it lacks little lattitude details lost soon there some shadows . battery so far usually lasts me whole day when i go touring . if i take care shut display down soon i dont need it anymore i find when i am cruise ship or visiting country i take all movies i usually want - - recharge when i get back my room night . only problem playback tv or pc . bundled software made ulead not user friendly , whereas previous xacti i played back images video clips order i taken , this one separates them plays back either clips or images . before i played back through my panasonic hard disk dvd recorder recorded dvd directly . now i go into my pc whole lot editing so far " movie factory " program keeps crashing . i imagine somebody eventually suggest better software program , or i learn use ulead , but time pictures clips ihave taken very good detail , machine operated flawlessly .	-1
very slow storage even fast card .... small but too thick comfortable handling . i ended up selling it ebay buying canon sd600 which great camera , thin enough fit your shirt pocket , fast storage images battery lasts very long time . i've charged it once taken many many holiday pictures . don't buy nikon without first checking out canon sd600 .	-1
this awesome little camera . except you can't use it night ! there horrible white spots nighttime photos when flash used . apparently these appear because flash so close lens this camera , so dust reflects badly . it known problem [ ... ] also , it totally annoying sony uses all their proprietary technology . result , cable connecting this camera computer unwieldly ( uhh , you heard usb ??!! ) , you buy sony memory stick , which probably won't work anything else you . flipside , you take movies aren't limited 30 seconds this guy - i think might result memory stick technology . but other than , design operation this little guy seems pretty slick . lens not one those pops out , so not sure if affects image quality all , but far i could tell , quality good . end , what good camera can't take usable pictures its flash ??	-1
i purchase this instrument twice . first time there black specks lense , so it returned . second time worst , i.e. same black specs but thing didn't work all . i also checked this manufacturer other models out most come disturbing black specks lense . this isn't quality optical product	-1
i bought this camera my 13-year old son take him soccer trip bermuda . it ok . felt sort cheap , but seemed like it would what it supposed . big drawback .... there no lens cover slips into place when picture isn't shot , so danger scratching lens immense . my son so afraid scratching lens , he barely used it . some few pictures he take ok , but others not best quality . i think this camera bit too costly what you get , i'm surprised , because i usually love samsung products	-1
ordered two frames third party source . neither them worked all . it nightmare trying return them refund	-1
this s80 used only wide angle compact point shoot digital camera market . it now discontinued i'm told . but , we're luck ! there three other digital point shoot cameras real 28mm wide angle lens ! these : 1 ) panasonic dmc-fx01 $250 , 2 ) canon powershot sd800 $400 . , 3 ) kodak easyshare v570 $350 . so , you ask , " who needs 28mm lens ?

normally i wouldnt write review , but i numerous experiences this camera i thought i would share . my sister first bought camera , i amazed how user friendly it i thought pictures turned out pretty well . shortly afterward , her screen blacked out , without any great impact or weather damage . naturally , i assumed it mustve gotten bumped wrong way , tough luck . i then proceeded buy one myself , couple months after i it , my screen also inexplicably failed work . then christmas , my sister received replacement camera her broken one , yet again , shortly after purchase , screen broken . i accept some responsibility damage , i imagine if it purse bookbag , perhaps it got rattled around bit . but three times ? i dont find this coincidence , i not reccomend you risk your money , because you too may replace it after 3 months	-1
is-dv only records videos ' asf ' format , not mpeg-4 . i bought one ' egghead.com ' . after 30 days , i contacted aiptek tell them problem , they acknowledged is-dv only records videos ' asf ' format . they said there nothing they it . not buy this product . aiptek advertises is-dv records video mpeg-4 format , but it doesn't . ' egghead.com ' won't deal me because they say i should deal manufacture after 30 days purchase date	-1
this product didn't appear add any appreciable sound benefit ; sound ecm-hgz1 appears same recorded native audio camera itself . i wish i not bought it	-1
noise problem this camera horrendous . not buy it ! if you take close-up picture eye you not able see eyelashes clearly ... never . no matter how hard you try . my 3-year old 5mpx sony much better than this panasonic camera . i am sorry i bought it . i would return this product if i could buy good camera instead . lumix dmc-lx2 camera cannot focus one bit , many pictures out focus made worse noise problem . even motion smother function turned many pictures come out blurred . noise very noticeable graininess appearing very readily . you tweak quality enhancing features sharpness , noise reduction , contrast saturation all you want but these worthless reduce noice sharpness problem . amazon website says you use standard sd memory which untrue(perhaps this corrected now ) . camera only accepts more expensive sdhc ( high capacity ) cards . these sdhc cards cannot read standard memory stick readers so i use usb port which takes forever download even handful pictures my computer .	-1
i am far expert however even amatuer this lens horrible . i took 400 shots my digital rebel xt got so frustrated witht poor quality auto focus i immediately returned it / got refund . all but brightest lighting conditions this lens extremely slow autofocus . many cases lens could not focus continually hunted through it entire range . since most my photography animals i simply could not wait autofocus work missed many shots . i tested autofocus against my canon 18-55 ef-s ( packaged rebel xt ) canon 75-300 ef . every instance where tamron could not focus canon lenses no problem ! when tamron would focus i found pictures not sharp my canon lenses . again i'm far expert however i only printing 4x6 photos . i replaced tamron quantaray(sigma ) 55-200 dc which proven very good autofocus great optical quality(for amatuers .. ) bottom line .. it hard part tamron because i really enthused zoom range however i would much prefer use 2 lenses focus than 1 doesn't . i read many reviews same problem noted . tamron needs get thier act together	-1
this kit conveniently contains 20 sheets photo paper . unfortunately , kodak doesn't contain ink cartridge them . fine , i thought , i'll buy separate cartridge . guess what ? you can't! kodak only sells cartridges bundled paper so you forced use their paper . why they sell paper separately but not ink cartridges ? seems pretty dirty	-1
this camera easy use it light decent quality picture audio , however , i unable make copies back-up or share family members . i took it back bought mini-dv camcorder i told it easier make copies . this yet tested	-1
hp selling this bag $30 bucks , so when i found it here $10 less i couldn't let this " deal " pass me ... however when i received bag , i wished i ... color less vibrant , it cheap , poor quality , plus hp isn't embroidered bag ... walk away this bag get blue black hp bag instead , it costs little bit more but it well worth it !!	-1
we purchased this camera overall it good camera . it took excellent outside video not great performer low light conditions but not atypical today reasonably priced minidv camcorders . however after six months lcd screen suddenly stopped working . it not mishandled otherwise camera works great . we sent it last november panasonic authorized service center . they returned it three months later unrepaired because part not available . we out $100 labor fees plus we still broken camera less than year old . i only share this warning potential buyers . panasonic not honor our warranty	-1
i received this gift first i thought it great , but then i realized it would only display 142 images . i worked technical support several months ( they not speediest or most helpful ) . i resized , renamed , restructured photos , tried them different media finally they admitted it bug . i rma'd unit my shipping expense course , only recieve same problem . i wouldn't recommend this purchase	-1
i own many sony products , including sony cybershot dsc-f717 , which i love . however , i am very disappointed this camera , sony cybershot dsc-t5 . i bought t5 my mother father present . it small , lightweight , portable ; easy use ; stylish . it take nice photos brightly lit environments , especially outside . however , after several months use , few problems become consistently evident : ( 1 ) there horrible red-eye ( white-eye ) artifact many pictures . so-called " red-eye reduction " setting nothing . ( 2 ) dim-light photography very grainy , lots noise . nigh t-t ime photography impossible . these problems not unique our camera ... you find many corroborating reviews above . overall , i am very disappointed this camera , wish i could exchange it something else . not buy this camera . other reviewers suggest t7 or t9 take much better pictures ( they still small pocket-size cameras ) .	-1
this worst camera i've ever owned . i'm not exaggerating . i'm so upset wasting money it . only pictures turn out , outside bright daylight . it takes horrible pictures low light , there high level noise photos . video mode moves out its own , ruining video . i sometimes get colored lines down right side videos . my friend $88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing . it just plain sucks .	-1
i haven't got this item because it too expensive what it gives . i fujifilm e550 camera which cost usd 250.00 this date . this lens cost usd 95.00 it need special adapter ring cost extra usd 20.00 . means you pay usd 365.00 8x zoom camera . price or less you get +10x slr like camera like fujifilm s5100 or s5200 .	-1
straight out box disappointment extremely poor quality . plug into wall not work . after trying numerous different outlets/wiggles cord , it finally powered . after putting card , pics ok , passable . mp3 popped moaned popped some more , i only playing very quiet jazz . this not worth money even though it cheap . pay little more get one better quality	-1
there currently known issue many sony camcorders . this called " black screen death " . what happens camera works great 1-2 years then ccd goes out like light . camera not take video again . sony evasive if not downright deceitful this issue when you call tech support . fact sony not stand behind their product . if this happens you , sony not own defect you out hundreds dollars . there lengthy thread cnet this issue . search sony black screen . wishing you luck purchase your ( not sony ) video camera , scot	-1

this first lens i've owned . i trouble justifying extra expense but am now quite pleased i took step up . keep mind tis ef not ef-s lens . this makes its effective focal length 45-215mm my digital rebel . i love zoom range ( great shooting action shots kids without getting their faces ) ability easily control depth field my nature shots . just uploaded some my recent shots this lens under " share your own customer images " . pete leclair http://www.agentz.com/digitalimagesbyjpl	1
i bought this camera same reason many you considering it , or already bought it--it size . it amazingly small , it hard believe all packed into this camera . i take it me everywhere , literally , it so small i am able keep it my pocket , i don't fear it get ruined my pocket because it so durable . there also small covering lens , so you need not worry lens get scratched . picture quality surprised me , when i first saw this camera i saw how small it instantly assumed picture quality would not good -- but i wrong ! picture quality this camera outstanding ( taking its ' size price into consideration ) . however , i few things complain ... first off , battery . this camera uses lithium battery , i find lithium batteries highly inconvenient ; because what if you vacation , where nearest place buy batteries just gas station -- there no way you going find lithium batteries there . not only it inconvenient , but also battery life span short . longest i've it work 1 hour 45 minutes . this isn't uncommon cameras , though , just long you bring your charger spare batteries , you should fine . problem i this camera zoom function . such small zoom length you would think zoom would silent since it hardly zooms ... wrong ! very wrong . zoom function this camera so loud sometimes you unable use it if you find yourself situation where you must quiet . even just turning camera move lens little , resulting noisy start-up . flash very weak . really dissapointing . if you inside , you can't any farther away then 10 feet lit room . last problem i found this camera macro function . auto-focus camera seems trouble focusing subject . make matters work , there no manual override overcome this problem . focus great , though , if you not taking macro sho t.t hese all flaws i found camera , it not my first choice cameras , i come across many other beginner cameras i prefer over this camera , but thing you keep mind this camera size . if you just looking something keep you all times , then this great camera choice .	-1
first all i not consider myself anything more than very beginning photographer !!! so i not go into anything technical . i leave people who know more than i . but what i am international traveler . i simply got tired coming home fantastic trips " snapshots " . i wanted someting much better , boy i get it this camera . i looked d70s since i very small hands , i could never feel comfortable holding it . this camera smaller without small . i only taken photos locally , but this time year leaves changing it makes good start . built editing features ( filters etc . ) wonderful work . i would highly recommend this camera anyone who wants something more than " point shoot " snap shots	1
wonderful camara , excellent characteristics , ample selection accessories available protected one you lead manufacture camaras lenses	1
i am thrilled this lens capabilities pictures it . i test shot corner window determine if it would good my insect shots i like so well . well , it great it came but i found i wanted 1/1 capability so i bought add-on converter am thrilled added both these necessary items my set-up . i like nature photography best like use my off summer days hiking finding photographs take perhaps well-known places but finding unique angles subjects what i like specialize . this lens greatly enhance your experience ' little world ' we commonly trod over or weed-ate away . i built diffuser using ping-pong ball over flash so lighting would work better . ( works great , btw ) . usual , it great canon glass trick	1
i spent alot time evaluating this product . finally after reading reviews i dug deep spent extra dollars get this lense . it wounderful addition my canon reble . it very high quality product easy use delivers beautiful shot every time .	1
i bought this lens little over year ago macro shooting . i quickly found out , however , shoot macr o-o nly this lens crime . it very versitile lens . its fast f/ 2.8 aperture makes good shooting low light . i pretty much use this outdoors 100mm 1.6 crop factor my rebel xt eliminates most indoor oppurtunities . i frequently use this lens family portraits , resultant photo so crisp clear bokeh really helps add snap primary subject . others stated , this heavy lens . it doesn't image stabilization ( ) so tripod or monopod great accessory get best images . i use beefy monopod my best shots , although i lot handheld gems ... if you tight cash , this isn't " one lens " it all . if you looking versitile lens outstanding macros portraits , this lens .	1
this lens pouch very durable good quality . it compacts down not unneccesary bulk . might seem alittle pricey but worth it long haul .	1
every picture mine included larger portions sky would these stubborn spores it . pretty infuriating , especially when you got shot just like you wanted it . yes , you always remove those photoshop ( or cheaper yet , gimp ); but isn't it cool when you look picture say : " it , nothing it ! " ?? it wasn't just sky . any off-white but light plain colored background would suffer visibly acursed specks . this blower , greatly priced ( pity adorama doesn't free shipping though ) , i put my camera tripod , pointed it down , squirted three or four times - gone specs !!! great buy dslr owners	1
never ending race larger larger megapixel counts , d70s fallen behind pack . ( however , if that only measure which you're judging digital camera - you really should consider further research before plunking down several hundred dollars . ) nevertheless , it quite good camera . what i like it most : - it looks feels solid . some reviewers pan this camera feeling flimsy plasticky apparently still stuck realm pro cameras cost several thousand dollars . it not bulletproof titanium box you back hummer over , but it certainly seems outdo dslrs it category . - very good battery life . - backwards compatibility decade worth nikon slr lenses . my gripes : - latch keeps pop-up flash place broke less than week . - inability meter through older manual focus lenses . - lack full functionality flashes other than sb-600 sb-800 . - nikon raw software control software aren't included camera , imho overpriced . ( ... top , nikon split what used one overpriced software package into two overpriced software packages ... ) what would improve this camera most : - iso 100 iso 3200+ - ability store multiple custom white balance presets , then pull them up fly . - replacing " idiot modes " ( i.e. " portrait " , " landscape " , etc . ) modes you could customize	-1
i bought this lens whim see what it would like shoot prime lens . $80 it certainly worth risk unlike many other canon lenses which cost thousands dollars . quality pictures this lens only thing making me move away zoom lenses	-1
i've my d2h 9 months now . i've heard magenta skin tones issue but never seen it .. skin tones my unit great . it seems this issue plagued minority users . camera very fast , exposes well delivers results . it primarily designed sports photojournalism camera -- situations where speed counts . it 4 megapixel wonder -- it true it only 4 megapixels , but they 4 great megapixels . images upsize wonderfully . i love my unit , am debating whether buy second one backup , or wait d2x . price d2x making decision bit easier i'm leaning toward d2h .	-1
i not find anything negative say this camera . i wanted small pocket sized camera tried brands such casio exislim . even though this camera not small casio , it far superior camera . size why , it still small enough fit pocket but also big enough so it isn't awkward or difficult use . pictures this camera turn out spectacular , 10x zoom far best feauture this camera . lcd screen also very clear , unlike casio other camera similar this one . you can't go wrong this camera . highly recommended	1
nice compact . tripod doesn't really work i expected . i am using my own tripod . overall nice little unit money	-1
my knowlege , there simply isn't better equipped camera professional investigator . it ir-sensitive mode ( nightshot ) bw ( rather than cheeseygreen ) , far superior quality-wise anything sony got , it only 3ccd i know low-light mode . image stabilization exceptional image quality production grade . time/date stamps " burned " so they xfer via firewire - again , only camera i'm aware this feature . audio turned off which we know must . best yet , you disable sleepmode so it won't turn off eliminating missed money shots waiting camera cycle back . it built like tank feels substantial hand , but it still lightweight thanks alloy frame . finally , it totally silent even tape transport full swing . only downside so far i tell it size - it big camera compared handicams i've , wouldn't well suited close-proximity work . however , black casing dosn't print/siloutte terribly , 16x optical lets you set back quite bit . highly recommended !	1
if you take lots photos , rechargeable batteries way go . carry other charged batteries you case you need swap them out	1
this case vital protect lightweight s1 which could easily damaged drop . case not detract convenience s1 , it adds virtualy no bulk camera so it still slips pocket or purse easily .	1
i just purchased my second m407 camera , yes that right i said second one . i purchased first year ago used it wilds idaho taking pictures all kinds weather every elevation imaginable . all pictures turned out great . i recently reason take more pictures indoors , new grand daughter . again pictures fantastic , several blown 11x17 matting framing , great quality . i would make several suggestion folks , buy digital camera batteries , every camera i owned eats batteries , this hp no different . if you spend money get good quality batteries they last ! second recommendation get sd memory card , if you like me you not happy interanl memory want take lots pictures . so , this photographer says you can't beat price , quality service you get hp . i forgot mention i camera didn't work , hp replaced within 2 days new one , no questions asked . good service goes long way my book . buy one you won't sorry !	-1

i owned kodak awhile pleased pictures however , my husband accidently fell while ice skating broke my camera . my family , knowing i love take pictures , decided replace my camera , but this time sony cybershot . i never more unhappy camera . needless say , i finally decided purchase this kodak z650 am so pleased results pictures . i am not professional photographer , just someone who likes take photos my kids , pets , flowers , vacation spots , etc . my sony horrible action shots if you any movement what so ever , photo appeared blurry . kids , isn't option . i gave camera my daughter whatever she wanted it . kodak , however wonderful job action shots well clear , crisp concise pictures . i absolutely love this camera ! i never go back brand only good things say kodak their products	1
i many traditional film slrs including original pentax k1000 ( fully manual ) , canon rebel xos canon elph . when considering digital slr cameras canon digital rebel point-and-shoot canon digital elph top my list . but $150 less than canon digital elph , casio exilim ex-s series better buy same features ( some cases better execution same features ) . if you're looking fun point-and-click camera record audio , avi movie files digital pictures this it . it takes 15 miuntes read manual you're off taking pictures . pay attention when reading manual everything else seem very intuitive . all cameras i i use this one most often . other users complained proprietary lithium ion battery but 3rd party equivalents available right here amazon site , you just look . my back-up battery only [ ... ] bucks . san disk 1gb memory cards cheap too , [ ... ] online , [ ... ] retail . last , i agree many users lock switch needs developed so you keep camera accidentally turning when it your pocket -- but remember many cameras this problem/lack/this feature . i solved my own issues buying [ ... ] case belt loop	1
i bought this rangefinder golf . it small enough i could keep it my pocket . it really helps me approach shots greens . it takes bit experience able focus flag . i usually use person green my target . after i got approximate read , i use scan mode find exact distance flag . careful tiny battery cover . it came loose i lost it golf course . fortunately , i recovered it amongst green grass . cover also green . i now put tape over it secure cover .	-1

yes it very fine lens . 105 mm long end also appealing but after buying this i decided sell it favour my ef 24-70 2.8 after 2 weeks usage . f4 makes clearly autofocus slower fuzzier . bokeh also worse than other one . viewfinder gets darker 1.6 crop bodies . 105 mm make very little difference image size . plus macro option weaker this one . if you don't care weight go ef 24-70 2.8 imho .	-1
well i too recieved " grey market " version product , international warranty only . this mentioned before , apparently rectified amazon , i hope i'll recieve same treatment . but this still troubles me . amazon continuing sell off cheaper merchandise , only addressing issue individual basis when people complain ? what grey market means product originally intended sale outside us , but imported because version product cheaper than version intended us sale . while it legitimate enough process , they should telling us if they it , because warranty invalidated sold outside boundaries system canon put place . i'm not even touching hardware until i find out what going it , so i can't rate its quality .. but i no doubt it quality piece hardware , i've never heard anyone anything bad say it , except its price , gripe i totally agree . let face it folks , if it wasn't proprietary accessory high priced camera system , it should really cost $20 . it just simple programmable timer no more sophisticated than most wristwatches	-1
i already digital rebel able sell it co-worker use proceeds my new rebel xt . faster , lighter , better . simple review . it took everything great my digital rebel made it better . some complain it feels " too light " ... ok ... it that your thing . me , it still solid pictures speak themselves . now , addition 10 mp rebel xt , i'll bet original xt purchased even better price . no downsides i think ..	1
pros : superb retention color , bokeh ( background blur ) , sharpness . fast silent accurate autofocus . great build quality . cons : size , weight price . not your everyday walkaround lens . expensive .	-1
this replacement identical battery pack i lost . works great , long life , no problems	1
this bag very spacious stylish . it holds my rebel xt my three lenses very well . i even hold 70-200mm f/4 there , although it bit snug . best part this bag it completely customizable . i set it up such way i get any one my lenses just slinging bag around unzipping only top compartment . this very useful when you don't want constantly set your bag floor access your equipment . i one complaint . when wearing this bag sling , it sit your right shoulder . i am more used bags sitting my left shoulder , so take some getting used . when i carry this " non-sling " mode ( i.e. not over my head ) , it comfortably sit my left shoulder . however , best most unique feature this bag ability it sling around access camera without taking bag off , which only possible if i wear it sling bag my right shoulder . it would nice if portion bag customizable well	-1

if you're looking high-quality telephoto zoom lens fast enough use indoors , you may found what you're looking . 70-200/ 2.8 lens produces beautiful results overall par 135/2 prime lens ( although not quite sharp ) . main downside this lens it big heavy . i don't mind carrying it around my neck camera so much , but when you go use if you put extra effort into keeping lens shaking your hands due weight . it not exactly sort lens i would want toss into my backpack , just due immense size . if you don't mind spending extra $500 , consider also 70-200/ 2.8 ( image stabilization ) version this lens . it weighs even more , but built unit should help compensate shaky hands whilst using lens	-1
this great tool those shots where you want get down low . macro work landscape/waterscape shots near ground so much easier angle finder than without . i also used it when doing portrait work get more flattering angle without kneel or stoop over whole time . now negative . it fogs up much easier than normal eyepiece , which makes seeing anything challenge under some conditions . big one me , especially macro work , you loose some light when using angle finder . so if you already working low-light situation , this only makes matters worse . but well-lit conditions where fogging not issue you want shoot low , this amazing accessory , thus 4 out 5 stars	-1
after reading number on-line reviews , i bought this lens few weeks ago straightly its low-light photography capability . what i gotten little more than i bargained . pictures it produces made casual hobbyist like myself look like pro , least admiring eyes unsuspecting acquaintances . now only if i heart mumble-jumble few far-fetched jargons , i might new packing order firmly place . when paired my rebel xti , 80mm effective focal length wide apertures make it ideal portrait lens . it also compact , light-weigh solidly built , fast acurate auto-focus , most importantly , superb optical qualities . best part i gotten these without breaking bank nor it break my neck hauling it around . however , despite its low-light capability , very attributes make this lens outstanding portraits , i.e. , narrow angle view shallow depth field wide apertures , make it odd choice in-door group photos . also if you taking action shots , 80mm focal length may not long enough provide safe distance avoid mishaps . instead distal observer , i found myself unwilling participant middle action ducking camera ever-curious tongues my golden retriever her playmates . no wonder zoom lenses so popular . what else there not like this lens ? not much unless you proud owner one mammoth expensive prime lens . well , it come free hood wonderful soft leather pouch , doesn't it	1
i using this lens 2.5 years it exceptional piece equipment , especially price ! i very rarely feel need get closer image than i achieve this lens . it very solidly built i am sure it continue primary piece my kit years come	1
kodak ph160 media cartridge kit best bargain around ! you get 4 cartridges plus paper each pack . i used more paper than ink ! thank you kodak such money saving kit	1
i just finished first set pics this machine surprised amazing sharpness accuracy autofocus , not mention deapth field when compared our older canon digital camera . don't fooled low price , however . 16mb card joke , batteries not rechargable . it best get 1gb memory card battery charger pack right away . price still very reasonable such high quality machine	1
i both canon version grip this version . they identical . i two rebel xts they work great . i like them feel it gives holding camera . camera small my hands this makes it perfect . if you thinking buying accessories rebel xt , this should one them . grip holds two batteries , which gives you way more shooting time . i highly recommend this	1
i say excellent purchase . i'm fan my p880 camera . wide angle len , feature included , allows take great panoramic views , no efforts . manual optical zoom great , gives you control picture i never comercial digital camera . one my favorites features zoom reviewing picture , 10x zoom you check detailed picture lcd screen your pc . 8 megapixels , allows you see great precision minimal details usually you don't see . great experience , when you take picture , return home , picture better than your memory . i'm still learning other features , but rigth now i think great performance-value relation , most important , allow my photos professional touch ,. south worldcarolina	1
i am very happy item i ordered . shipment fast price cheaper than retai	1
i use it my s70 .. it works over 10meters ( thats right ! ) back too , so i am very happy it .. i bought it today so maybe it improved now ..	1
works advertised . i use it extensively environmental work where i want remain short distance my camera . it great portraits where i am near concentrating my subject shoot remotely without losing contact model . remote also came handy several self-promotions where i seated seating myself office atmosphere .	1
i mainly use this when taking landscape shots where i want either make clouds pop or liven sky up some ( remember it works best 90 degrees sun . ) i also put it when shooting highly reflective vegetation or waterscapes would otherwise cause blown-out highlights . one other little secrete use this when shooting waterfalls since it allow you shoot slower shutter speeds thus increasing wispy waterfall look .	-1
this my third digital camera , but it few years since second it definitely obsolete . i tempted go top line , because i've two excellent slrs ( nikon minolta ) all trimmings , but prices made unfeasible right now . i'm very satisfied features canon g6 however ; i've taken 400 shots so far , plus one movie , tried out all software stitching panoramas together , etc . i still mainly use photoshop , but canon software quite good . photo quality excellent , including color opticalzoom wideangle range good most purposes . macro setting also nice job . controls easy use most part anyone all familiar full featured slrs , better than most . i've made very few mistakes field result control confusion . what i'm less thrilled ( nitpicking ): like most electronics these days , even if you've got very small hands like me , it hard keep getting finger wrong place , just every square inch covered control . i would liked insert ( like nikon supplies ) cover flash hotshoe contacts . every time i remove battery or memory card , i watch out grab camera few areas don't control them . also , cable input typical tiny plastic door would all too easy break off , neck strap attachment too close memory card door , tends interfere it opening all way . also , preview mode it tells you how many shots you taken but not how many left , shooting mode , vice versa . it annoying switch shooting mode see how many left , especially if you using lens cover , because then lens deploys out , you remember take lens cover off first ( deploying lens cover no-no . ) i also got camera case designed g6 . again like all too many " cases " it tight fit , only single inside pocket you only get extra card still get camera too . case would not really good dust protection it zips up sides but top opening just covered flap . because tight awkward fit , it easy accidentally turn camera , deploying lens , while putting camera into case . case comes belt loop , but you supply your own belt , it no other strap or handle except tiny loop located top end side zipper , where it just gets way . not good design . i also checked out some accessories available , like additional lens flash , but they're very expensive , like macro lights more than camera ! so i don't know if i'll get any add-ons later . but overall , g6 already my next favorite camera my nikon slr , powerful yet easy use , even fun ! definitely 5 stars camera , 1 star case	1
i hear lot grumbling camera not " perfect . " but guess what ... this size form factor one should not expecting slr-like performance . i just purchased this camera last week busy testing it out variety situations . " full auto " mode pretty decent job figuring out right settings most situations . if you want you take total control set most controls manually . there even bunch pre-programmed setting different lighting situations couple i tested worked great . all all , great camera size . i like fact i put this my shirt pocket forget it then when i suddenly need take picture i always camera handy . i normal speed sd memory card writing out images card painfully slow . this especially true when trying take number quick shots rapid succession . wait camera become ready take next shot annoying . i would highly recommend you purchase one high speed sd cards ( often advertised " ultra ii " or " 32x " or " high speed . " all all great camera if you realistic your expectations you very happy . good luck	1
i some dust spots my lenses , mirrors inside . i afraid use brush or cloth kits , since they could easily scratch . one my photography books suggested i use this exact air blower , so i thought i'd give it try . it simple tool , but it emits strong amount air i able clean everything off . even works well keyboards or other dusty spots	1
top line . works advertised . ttl , e-ttl . 4 double aa batteries . tilt , rotate head , soft lens built . control slave flash	1
i looking medium range zoom my d-70s reasonably fast sharp throughout zoom range . this lens first class winner all areas . it my first vr lens ( vibration resistance ) alone makes it worth cost . no more tripods ! it smooth operation feels very solid ( if not little heavy ) use . f/ 2.8 speed coupled 8 aperture leaves gives velvety smooth bokeh ( desirable soft blurred background ) makes your subject snap right out shot . len razor sharp 70mm 200mm . if there any distortion , i haven't seen it . lens this long , ghosting might show up if you shoot almost directly into sun . huge hb-29 lens hood helps lot . again , i not seen any ghosting yet . this definately pro/pro-sumer len its price tag alone re-enforces fact . if you afford it , remember golden rule ... it lens makes picture not camera . all pixels world can't make up poor lens . if you ready play big boys , then this belongs your bag	1
this handy little tool must not just nikon owners , but all camera owners . genius design function , i would whole-heartedly urge every person camera buy one , or many , asap	1
wicked 8.5 frames per second , this sports/action/photojournalists dream camera . if you need speed this one . aimed squarely sports shooters photojournalists , canon it . if you looking more portrait/art/wedding camera get canon 5d	1
i am professional photographer , i owned this camera nearly two years . i also d70 backup . batteries go forever , it very quick respond , images beautiful , it typical nikon durability reliability . if you already nikon user , controls fall easily hand . said , computer software this camera joke . best image quality shoot raw files , color balance grey card , render images software like capture one le . uselessness included software only reason this camera gets four instead five stars . come , nikon , real !!! shortly after i got my first d70 , i shot model small photo side bar catalog . i got ugly feeling my gut when i told designer taken shot 3/4 figure , cropped head shoulders , enlarged image cover 8.5 11 catalog . time i found out , it already printer . it turned out , i pleasantly surprised : cover shot looked great . after incident , i trusted this camera always pleased results . this camera better than 35 mm every way except response shutter button . resolution color reproduction it more comparable medium format film camera . it imperative shoot raw process files properly get most out this camera . i can't wait try d80	-1
i am 67 years old started out photography kid contact printer box camera . i all types cameras over years , mostly 35mm film canon slr . i too bought all sorts these 5-7 mp point shoot digital cameras before returning my true love , slr . i my digital canon rebel xt month now i can't keep my hands off it . it lacks nothing . although kit lense good , i bought 28-135 canon zoom lense image stabilizion produced stunning photo it . i love way you use 7 points focus , i mainly use only center point focus lock never get out focus picture . i guess nicest thing me i now don't urge buy every point shoot camera paraded out qvc or hsn " wonderful " new feature like " low light or non-shake . " this canon every good feature known universe you can't outgrow it . its camera let you good you , it won't hold you back . battery life great , built flash good but i bought 430ex that even better . i never figure i'm wasting money buying accessories this camera it my main squeeze many years come . i always missed my 35mm canon slr now feel i old friend back again , only much much better . believe me , you can't go wrong getting this camea , its beyond description ...	1
black color adapter hood nice match gunmetal finish s3 . fit good they what they supposed . i noticed hood tends " lock " adapter if you accidently squeeze it when unscrewing it -- probably because plastic bends little . use lighter touch it unscrews right off . one off-putting thing me price these two inexpensive pieces plastic . i know they may precision-engineered plastic nice finish , but please , over 15 dollars each two pieces ? they're plastic ! i know corporations supposedly owe it stockholders maximize profits , but perhaps these could included s2/s3 standard equipment . or sold price more line construction material	-1
my mom i each one these cameras . neither , one us any problems until recently . i dropped mine while taking pictures timer . drop my tile floor smashed telescoping lens out alignment wouldn't close gave e8 error screen . i contacted canon us website then , i sent it into canon repair center il . it cost $87 it repaired shipped back . it took week half it returned me . only thing i would improve this camera speed , i trouble taking pictures my son merry go round(but it could i need change settings ) . it many features it accessories add . since , i am learning more digital photography this great little starter camera many features canon known . also recently i've looking some newer canon models , their casing/ bodies look/feel really cheap me . it may make them lighter but it makes me really afraid i would break them	-1
i purchased this lens back march 2005 shoot static " warhammer models " my 10d . i found longer lenses such sigma 105mm , canon ef 100mm , tamron sp autofocus 90mm all " too long " 10d 1.6 focal crop would result requiring me use lot more physical space what i room get sho t.t he canon ef 50mm f/ 2.5 nearly perfect match 10d this purpose . its small , its compact , its short focal length not require i standing three feet away model i'm shooting . far shooting non-static objects , such insects , lens slow focus loud , both noise vibration , which results " startled " subjects missed shots . same also applies non-macro shots well . its slow focus makes it poor choice action photography , its loud enough draw attention you when you attempting other shots well	-1
this great camera takes place earlier canon digital elph i lost several years ago . 7.1 megapixels ensures great quality 3x zoom provides crisp clear pictures . fact digital zoom also works great - just make sure camera steady ( i purchased nice compact monopod results awesome ) . although image stabilization feature newer models would great , you can't beat price overall quality this camera pictures it takes . canon sd500 great little camera	1
pros : - reduces flare ghosting when shooting bright light . - helps protect your lens dirt scratches . - somewhat protects lens case fall . better break hood than front element . - makes you look more like you know what you doing helps keep others carelessly walking front you . cons : - increase lens movement windy situations , kind like sail boat . - takes up more room your bag , even when reversed they still add diameter lens . - people take more notice you , help blow your cover if you trying keep low profile .	-1
i can't believe how advanced things become . quality pictures printed kodak easy share media cartridge .	1
i love this product , because i love camera printing dock . i using them 2 years . my daughter-in -law son got theirs little earlier because arrival their first child . i saw it one these marvelous things i could myself home . i think she discovered your site you sold product . we both purchased you few times . thanks reasonable film prices allowed me take more pictures copy my friends relatives	1
i am really glad i bought this lens . it comes hood which reversed when not use so it very useful . leather pouch , front cap , back cap included . focusing super fast usm .	1
it bit heavy but superb lens . interior construction quite bit plastic however which bit concern . i've dropped one onto hard packed dirt/soccer field w/no damage ... so it pretty sturdy :) if you live 1 stop less light consider newly released 70-200 f/4 . this new 70-200 f/4 canon save you some weight if concern	1
i bought this camera owning 2 more digital cameras . one kodak canon ( a70 ) . amazing product ... pro ... almost everything .. cons ... no audio videoi definetly recommend product price	-1
my husband bought me this camera early christmas gift . first i wasn't love it . i disappointed because i wanted camera image stablization . this camera instead boasted its iso sensitivity settings fast shutter speed . ( they claimed it similar image stablization ) when i first tried it out i very low light setting experiencing some blur my images which exactly what i trying avoid new camera ! i almost traded this one something different ( cheaper priced olympus ) but thankfully i gave camera chance first decided play around all manual settings . there lot them menus so you fine tune it like you wouldn't believe . this ability change its setup what made me stick sony . however , i wouldn't say this camera ideal very low light situations . two preset choices shooting low-light scene without flash won't give you crystal clear pictures especially if you experience tiny bit camera shake . but again , it goes back adjustments menus , you make manual adjustments get pretty decent pictures minumal ( or no ) blur . but you take time find set right iso light settings . i highly suggest using histogram you pop-up onto screen help . unless you willing spend $200 more camera , you won't find one perform great very low light anyway . like my husband said ... " really ... how often you taking shots dark honey ? " hey , there halloween trick-or-treating fouth july fireworks other night time events i retorted , but he right . there really isn't lot real low-light pictures you take where you aren't using flash . i know lots people ( me included ) like try figure out all menu options settings their own before reading manual ... but this one , if you really want super amazing shots , reading manual give you lot insight how powerful camera it really . people always read manual this probably big " duuuh " ! but if you like me like try rush through figure it out , you missing out ton nice options . some great features : camera doubles video camera it only limited recording up amt space available your memory stick . other cameras only let you record pre-set maximum number minutes . i also like burst modes which allow you take shots fast succession . great action shots . but take note , when using burst mode you cannot use flash . ( again , watch out low light ! )i 3 year old daughter fast shutter speed ( burst ) works great well lit situation . just other day i caught shots her running around jumping up down came out crystal clear . no blur all . every flying bouncing hair her head came out perfectly frozen time . quite neat ! i gave this camera 4 stars because camera performs wonderfully every situation except very low light . but price , you can't much better anyway . its great buy i think just anyone would pleased receive it gift .	-1
i don't personally subscribe notion big brand manufacturers always make best lenses out there , but this one instance where they really , honestly . this thing lightning fast , sharp tack , bokeh much better than sigma equivalent , you'll hard time finding use your raw processor chromatic aberration correcting sliders when coupled digital body ( you still get some purple fringing around backlit subjects , but genuine ca bad enough show up print so far proven non-existent me any focal length or aperture ) . weight serious downside , but it one i live . if you're nature photographer who really problem holding still or if you plan using extension tubes , version might worth extra $700 you , but if you're doing event photography where subjects ones jumping around like rabbits , save your money your battery power ; ain't thing wrong this lesser model	1
although people problems first generation this grip , i've completely satisfied mine . recently , i've shooting 300 2.8 , it would much more difficult without extra length grip ads body . similarly , second set buttons vertical shooting makes big difference , too . ( one note : when shooting vertical , it hard actuate thumb wheel impossible use joy stick -- which i frequently change focus points -- without moving my right hand . ) holding two batteries , grip also keeps me worrying running out juice during high volume shooting sessions . grip still little flex it , but i've never any power problems i've read here elsewhere	-1
optika mp100 pro photo monopod surprisingly sturdy , functional well-made . it supplied reasonably decent quality zippered nylon case carrying strap . no , it not " professional grade " , but it something every amateur photographer use weekend shooting . i've used it both digital still camcorder , where it offers respectable improvement long-distance shots ( versus trying hold camera still , or propping it up roof car , not-nearby-enough fence post , so . ) certainly lot handier than old tripod ! i bought two , keeping them ready-for-action trunk my cars . highly recommended	1

photography afficionados long two choices when it comes buying digital camera : tiny everything-automatic portable camera takes decent pictures or brick-sized everything-manual professional camera takes fantastic pictures . almost decade after introduction consumer digital camera , sony finally taken swing combining best qualities both worlds into one package , dsc-w100 solid first effort . sony tiny part down some time - dimensionally , w100 par other recent cybershot models competitor brands ' offerings , features now-common 2.5 " bright lcd display minimum buttons back . aside attractive mini-diamondplate face chrome trim , visually there little set this camera apart among others your local electronics counter . initial toying camera doesn't dispel any first impressions . all prerequisite automatic features there , buttons smartly arranged so all most common functions right hand , it obviously point-and-shoot camera . but it when you begin delve into features you realize w100 something entirely differen t.t he usual mode knob there back auto mode scenes modes , but now there program manual modes - something standard issue professional cameras but radically new point-and-shoot . this means you use any combination auto or manual settings all functions get shot . example , shooting dimly lit room , you use slow shutter flash even out lightning , or turn off flash slower shutter richer colors , or raise iso so you get steady shot higher shutter speed , or just put it auto shoot , etc . all different possibilities previously reserved just professional cameras now your disposal . camera simple or involved you want , it still fits your pocket . i've owned several other digital cameras , both portable pro , they've all somewhat manual features , but w100 takes it new level . mounting w100 tripod , i attempted get long exposure shot night sky , something all other digital cameras adequately . manually setting shutter speed , camera displayed overall exposure value i adjusted - camera telling me before even touching shutter button if resulting picture would dark , bright , or even . i set shutter slow it could go using two-second timer , fired away . picture amazing ; though only few stars visible eye , w100 caught light well over hundred . i noticed bit radial blur stars around border image , only realize later camera pointed north - shutter speed so slow i actually * capturing rotation earth * . now that manual . also special note w100 digital " smart zoom " . general rule digital cameras , you should disable digital zoom feature , zooming beyond optical range produces cropped therefore lower-quality image . but here again sony trick up it sleeve , cropping 8.1 megapixel capture regardless where you image size set . if you shoot 5 megapixel-size picture utilizes digital zoom , image actually captured full 8.1 mps then your 5mp picture cropped . result optically-zoomed clear picture . this also means lowest image size , you get full 15x zoom ( equivalent 500+ mm telephoto - pocket camera ! ) . it absolutely brilliant technique you'll probably see all future digital cameras . sony still bit more work pocket slr idea . included your purchase accessories catalog featuring array lenses filters , none which compatible w100 . it typical sony bizarre distribution features any given product lineup , but it would seem obvious most slr-like camera should slr-like accessories . w100 owners should disable auto focus illumination light when shooting people ; blazing red light great focusing inanimate subjects , but could probably used tactical light blind assailants pinch . overall , w100 remarkable newcomer truly raises bar what you expect point shoot pocket camera . novices accommodated full automation , learn gradually trying out individual manual functions while other settings remain automatic . experienced photogs right home manual mode wide range settings . five stars what hopefully sony work progress	1

this fit my olympus e500 great . i recently took overseas trip this bag great traveling go trips . weatherproof cover really came handy few time when it started rain unexpectly . only thing bit odd strap you wear around your body . it comes up chest odd angle , my husband didn't problem it but i . so maybe thats just girl thing .... :) most times i didn't use extra strap , just threw it over one shoulder went . bag held 2 lenses , extra battery , charger , i room keys , wallet few little personal odds ends . my friend so impressed it , he buying one today . some one asked if they attach tripod bag . there aren't really any extra loops outside bag . stadard tripod won't fit insidde . you would rig something up outside yourself . imo i don't it would work very well but you try .	1
incredible quality zoom ! low power consumption . buy 1gb sandisk compact flash card . it gives you plenty room 2-3 week vacation	1

i this camera week now . i bought ef 28-105mm lens seperatly . i don't know why , but auto focus not work right away . it took some fiddling around before i able use feature . i get gorgeous pictures this camera . my one complaint it feels small right hand . after 1/2 hour shooting pictures my hand got cramp . i small hands it still felt small me . if you considering this camera i'd go store see how it feels . i can't imaging able use it long time if you big hands . i'm still learning how use it . but so far its meeting all my expectations .	-1
bottom line : i needed replace lens my canon rebel xt d-slr . ef-s first glance seemed like perfect replacement since canon produced ef-s series specifically compressed sensor d-slr line . after weighing pros cons two , i chose this ef lens largely basis price . it right choice , i haven't found any loss features or quality . multiplying range 1.6 35mm equivalence ( if you rebel xt , 20d or 30d ) , this model really just slightly wide angle stronger telephoto zoom . ( 45mm-170mm if it 35mm film camera ) if this range suits you , then this lens excellent value over ef-s wide-angle/telephoto zoom . you'll keep all features , save money faster lens . ef series meshes well current line canon digital slrs . addition , unlike ef-s series , they compatible all canon eos products including higher-end cameras like mark ii . specific observations weeks use : my first concern before purchasing this lens minimum focus distance 0.5 meters , or approximately 18 inches . i lot macro work transferring images into digital , so i tad worried . however , after getting lens zooming , i realized focusing distance wasn't really issue after all . most cases , i could manage stand six or so inches further away still get highly magnified shot . so you see macro function works well , i've uploaded image small hamster photographed 102mm . ( aperature pretty big -- after all , hamster moving target)my second concern lens quality sharpness , particularly wide-angle setting near edges photo . this lens exceeded my expectations . so you see quality this lens , i've uploaded uncropped picture sf bay bridge taken 28mm wide-angle setting . you'll see photo sharp all way through edges frame . ( it web-sized jpeg , so you should take into consideration use it mainly see sharpness photo , particularly near outside edges)i get unexpected bonus this lens . manual focus ring front . i love it . disabling auto-focus snap , position feel manual focus perfect sports or social activities where subject often not closest object . ring itself ridged made rubber , making handling breeze . while i hadn't expected replace my stock lens so soon , i think it ended up best . this lens actually superior one came xt . i lost some wide-angle function but gained much more telephoto . price excellent quality lens high .	1
this remote handy tool . it very basic use shutter release . it best use shutter release when your camera tripod low light situations . using shutter release this way helps limit camera shake which improves your images . other programmable features include self timer , interval timer , long exposure , exposure count . you permitted use any combination all or none these settings making possibilities virtually limitless . i used self timer so i could both take picture , it . self timer set just shy 100 hours if you wanted . time lapse , combination interval timer which set just shy 100 hours exposure count which set up 99 shots should set . self timer used delay first shot if desired . long exposure also set up just shy 100 hours . settings entered any time without worry inadvertent alterations . pressing light button until hold indicator displayed deactivate all but light button or prevents stop/start button deactivated once operation started . tc-80n3 operated one cr2032 battery . i've my remote over 2 years battery still going strong . i'm not sure how long battery supposed last , but there indicator display panel let me know when battery starts get low . if battery fine , i don't see indicator all . there storage place back your cameras rc socket cover if you one . i use this canon 20d so it no use me . plug connects camera simply pressing plug into socket . disconnect , pinch plug side pull out . me , this item must . i enjoy low light photography i get plenty use just this reason . it great option available other photographic opportunities . it clear me this well thought out , quality product canon . pros : acts simple shutter releaseprogrammable options include self timer , interval timer , long exposure , exposure countcons : cable only 34 inche	1
i olympus 5mp point-n-shoot camedia camera i pretty happy portraits . i annoyed w/ fixed lens prevented me taking good photos wildlife . i hummingbird feeders my backyard unless you've opportunity work hummingbird families years , sweet , tiny animals skittish don't often pose you when you get too close . when my point-n-shoot stopped focusing , i took advantage this situation rationalizing this bigger purchase . what joy it use this camera . 6.3 mp significant improvement over 5 ability take photos manual mode cannot understated . fixed point-n-shoot , camera refused shoot if it didn't " feel " it focus ... so it impossible shoot sunsets , lightning or other natural beauties " infinity " range focal length . rebel makes use compact flash - oldest , yet still best technology taking fast , high-quality photos digital cameras . my less than perfect rating due small memory buffer . you take up 3fps very easily , but if you click-click-click shutter , it doesn't matter if bigfoot , loch ness monster elvis start doing little soft-shoe right front you , time rebel finishes writing recent 3 quick shots cf card , shot century already slithered back into swamp time camera ready used again . if you're taking portraits , not problem . click here there you'll never notice lack memory buffer ... but if you're shooting ball game or other quick moving objects , you're going get frustrated very quickly . flash decent , but you really need good flash like 580 hot-shoe if you want better even spread avoidance red-eye . lot folks shrug red-eye since most affordable or free programs like iphoto or photoshop elements built-in correction red-eye - but red-eye correction one click only available humans . if you're shooting wildlife , forget any software one-click ( or million clicks ! ) solution blue-eye dogs , yellow-eye cats , flaming-demon eye bunnies or variety odd reflections you get bouncing off retinas various species . best way circumvent this problem avoid bouncing flash directly into retinas your subjects get-go . no more glare or odd reflections when you use better flash . ability upgrade better lenses crux slr ownership . sky limit . get good wide-angle good , fast telephoto you've got yourself set some great shots . this camera isn't going take advantage cf cards faster than 40x , so you save money buying slightly slower cf cards , but i invested 80x cards so i use them when i upgrade cameras . this rebel gotten me back into photography after decade-long hiatus . camera automatically detects vertical shots turns them 90 degrees you lcd window . it quick easy adjust iso " push " film ( so speak ) take advantage low-light situations , but you get same grainy effects you when you push real film . iso 100 using 512mb cf card , you 157 photos your disposal - if you push it all way 1600 , 104 shots same card . 400 , your shots already compromized regarding print quality ... but if sasquatch comes-a-knockin ' wee hours , you'll still get decent proof if you shoot 1600 . background film photography spanning 2 decades , i didn't even consult manual this camera use it fresh out box . it handles many ways like professional film slr , unlike point-n-shoots , there aren't cryptic settings no film parallel . sunny days outdoor shots , this camera sheer joy use	-1
i got this lens my 300d ( digital rebel ) kit enjoyed it ever since . solid , durable , reliable , good most light situations . lots success wide-angle landscape photos . i'm typically using this 18mm end it produced beautiful images , especially sunset indoors flash . also very light small , i just toss it my bag i'm set . pretty decent close-up stuff well like flowers , etc . overall it good starter lens if you're getting it kit , but you could probably grab it used $60 i would guess if you're just looking good all-around lens	1

great company - delivered product time . tested out lens mexico , brazil , canada . when automatic settings camera ( canon 10d ) selected pictures taken outdoors lot daylight , background overexposed . this results things like clouds not included picture . manual settings adjustments within camera remedy problem . however , there expectation lens canon should take quality pictures automatic setting . otherwise lens works great	-1
very happy quality pics but most it ... it size .. it really really small one ... but really powerful it size ... overall performance pretty good .. it week . everything looks good till now .. except sd card provided it .. it practically useless . you take only 8-9 pics full resolution . would definately suggest everyone buy atleast 512 mb card but overall i satisfied purchase amazon service usual " " rate	1

i'm looking closeup lens my canon eos rebel xt . but before buying i wish i see some pictures taken using this lens	-1
controls little complicated get used , especially all-manual settings -- which should definition easy use -- but overall this camera very rugged very capable . after i bought it , i took d10 budapest , hungary . i great view danube set my camera up night shots . it brilliant job . how this : take digital night shot ( use largest image size possible ) , use 300mm lense blow results up 24x30 through shutterfly.com . image remained amazingly sharp . colors fantastic . camera made it easy look like pro . only gripe i this camera i wish it black white setting like other less expensive canon digitals , but this overcome software so it not huge issue . price great , it magnesium body ( vs . rebel plastic body ) . you get lot d1/d20/d30 , without cost	1
i bought this lens i walking out africa month half safari . i didn't own true wide angle lens i just spent most my budget 70-200mm usm " " lens 1.4 extension . i wanted get widest lens i could get but i didn't big bucks get 16-35l or 14mm so i got this lens figuring i could correct photoshop cs2 later . this what i found : 1 ) i 20d it doesn't barrel distort anywhere near bad i thought it would .... i imagine it distorts quite bit more 5d or other full frame sensor but 20d , 10d , 30d , or rebel it not bad . 2 ) it distort enough even 20d its noticable every single inside shot many panoramic shots .... experienced professional , you'd notice it even panoramas . 3 ) computer person : i find it very easy correct barrel distortion photoshop cs2 very easily .... i use plugin ( there several web)4 ) i tend like barrel distortion look some my pictures . pros1 ) image quality superb . not lens , this lens some amazing color , sharpness , saturation . they spared very little grinding this lens . some my best african pictures , daytime nightime taken this lens they fabulous . 2 ) build pretty well , metal mount , metal integrated hood ... but not up standards any means .... its credit , it survived 14 days vibration ridden truck treking across kalahari desert all its dust , mokoro canoeing okavango delta over week , hiking , elephant riding , five diamond resort victoria falls ( last one easy fisheye ) ... 3 ) it fisheye lens if used properly , it create some amazing pictures views ... example botswana okavango , i knelt down next gigantic baobab tree pointed it up towards sky , fisheye captured not only rex guide standing next tree but entire massive trunk baobab all canopy tree way above . everything ! i know few lenses would let me . it amazing shot only possible fisheye . 4 ) it focuses 12inches . 5 ) f/ 2.8 makes it very good low light situation . 6 ) integrated hood comes complete nice metal cover . cons1 ) its not built like : ) no usm motor so you hear whir it tries focus ) no moisture seals etc ) it metal mount2 ) it fisheye lens -- i found out after month half what this meant .... it doesn't stay my camera much . i take it out when i need certain effect or when i plan retouch photoshop . it distorts visibly 20d i imagine quite bit more full frame . 3 ) integrated hood ... can't put screw filters ... but it gel filter holder . 4 ) no bag . my veredict : 1 ) i've purchased 16-35mm canon " " lens stays camera most time when i want wide-angle but when i need special look or i really want capture everything , i bring out my 15mm fisheye . i won't sell it , i don't regret buying it . i learned what specialty fisheye lens its staying my arsenal those special shots . 2 ) i can't compare against non-canon lenses but i say canon quality here extraordinary . i would knock them construction but lens built well enough " glass " itself spectacular so 5 stars . 3 ) i ordered amazon 3 days before my trip --- it arrived next day . great service . thx amazon .	1
this filter must photographers care their gear . it remains cost effective tool protecting camera lens while serving great every day filter .	1
coolpix l4 great camara . love night modes , portrait . takes great pictures , took it our honeymoon , all pictures came out great . it also takes very good movies , i thought it wouldn't why i didn't go one speaker , but seeing cuality both pictures video , i should gone one mic , that l3	-1
amatuer photographer this gives me what i need price i afford . it many features i am still learning how use . difference pictures d50 takes dslr compared cheap digital camera like night day . i am really happy this camera lens combination i purchased . i anything macro spider zoom-in squirrel sitting tree . battery good life span i rarely change it my spare while shooting . remember puchase seperately your memory card it not part purchase . i'd recommend least 2gb card , which also purchased amazon . i able catch squirrel jumping trees because number frames you take each second . it also so easy take photos indoors without using flash obtrusive during event you photographing . i also recommend purchasing 52mm lens filters , keep your nikkor lenses free fingerprints , etc .	1
i just finished semester brisbane , australia . i must say , retrospect , best thing i took me this trip this camera . she champ , definitely adventurous camera . thing cute hell yet solid like rock . i cannot remember amount times i dropped it sand , no negative consequences whatsoever . i even dipped it ocean mistake once ( not encouraged ) thing still works like charm . it also features like sepia weird flash makes lights something funny , making pictures wicked cool . outer covering shown wear , but it only helps acknowledge this camera take rough handling . people even comment this positive light , it become part my travelling gear . it also great scenic shots , panorama option . retrospect , it amazing buy , so affordable ( i'm backpackers ' budget) ! only because i seen amazing skies breathtaking scenery would i consider upgrading camera better pixelage . but if you staying hole-in-the-wall hostels or sleeping beach , you don't want expensive camera you . this thing great . battery life also great ( sake topping off cake )	1
life this battery so much longer than my stock battery my camcorder ( canon zr70 ) , i no longer worry keeping it charged . i also use my viewscreen more often instead doing everything through eyepiece . my camcorder experience improved because it i focus video not worry if my battery starts run out .	1
i think point lot people not mentioning d200 quite obvious . let me first say main reason i bought d200 over d80 increase my credibility prestige amateur photographer , make other photographers jealous my kit , brag obscene amount money i spend camera equipment while my co-workers can't even pay their rent . i bought grip because i thought it looked really cool , it increased size visibility my camera other people . question really sold me d200 : strangers i might want photograph more likely say yes standing other side d80 or d200 ? people less doubts me holding this thing opposed smaller model ? which one looks cooler ? if i completely loaded would i buy d2xs ? without second thought . course i talked lot camera people making minimum wage hoping they would some technical insight purchasing nikon or other camera . course they let me down said lot bogus things me most saying something like : " d200 way much camera me . " none them knew how change exposure settings , they contented wheel " child mode , " top d80 recited this me several times if i looked like soccer mom . usual i offended human experience buying real world , especially atrocious mark up several hundred dollars , i refused help pay those employees wages . breaking point i think time associate instructed me buy one camera over other because , " when she dropped this camera it broke other one didn't . " so i turned internet where i only say hi ups man he leaves . i studied studied all things technical , sometimes just staring pictures cameras long periods time without blinking . i poured over thousands photographs taken all kinds cameras amassed photographic library while i decided . basically i went way overboard let decision buying camera engulf my life until i dreaming it . so one night i just bought d200 after fence over d80 or d200 . after two days it arrived i impressed it . thing literally cold hard photographic machine . after broken d50 i firstly impressed size , then secondly all dials switches change things i used dig through menu get . thirdly i liked blazing fast 2 frame rate . when i go out night i snap 50mm f/ 1.8 onto it crank iso up . lot people forms complaining noise high iso d200 but i thought it fine . i feel most people camp want perfect clarity all way up into highest isos but i think artistically limiting . i read one scathing review written veteran film user saying basically high iso digital lot less graininess than film basically saying d200 step up but some people still want complain . far d200 goes versus d50 iso 1600 it leaps bounds better my opinion . noise way reduced without nr there isn't pixel chunkiness i found d50 high isos . thing stands out d200 enhanced colors . reality ultra vivid setting d200 makes lot things look sort fake , but it make people who don't sun tan look like they one which plus my opinion . it make your dull green lawn look like lush paradise , skies ultra blue , reds spectacular . i remember when i used d50 i would steer away photographing violets red roses because it would blow them out , not so d200 . some reason coming point shoot it always used annoy my d50 didn't bw or sepia . d200 bw but no sepia . nerds forums would just say , " use cs2 , or photo editor , " but i say no because i should able everything camera . viewfinder so awesome . i literally hated electronic viewfinders d50 viewfinder so small it hindered my framing times . d200 big bright viewfinder huge lcd sucks down batteries like nothing . far my evolution goes photography sometimes i feel like i literally climb into viewfinder because its so big compared what i used . like i said grip awesome i really like it . i kind like many accessories possible kind steered me away d2xs into d200 . watching percentage marks count down batteries drain always fun . best thing d200 little things like because they make me feel like i greater control over my pictures because i know exactly how many i take . conclusion buy d200 over d80 i am really happy it i am not happy anything . if you're trouble considering what you want photographically try pull yourself away forums outside sources really consider what got you into photography first place where you intend go it , i think important part . advertising gear collecting never made anyone better artist	1
i got this filter kit today . first impression not very promising when i saw " made usa " printed package . i said , well it would nice if these filters made japan but i decided give it chance . second impression even worse , since these filters dirty some fingerprints it , clearly indicating product not brand new . apart i didn't like quality metal rings . it just didn't fit well my dmc-fz50 . i cannot speak functionality because i didn't actually try use it but judging overall quality i don't expect much	-1
i love my new camera . it takes great pictures it easy opperate	1
i've owned this charger over year now it flawless . batteries seem last longer when charged this charger than other 1hour charger i own . very fast charging batteries never hot after charging ( hot sign they stressed = shorter lifespan ) . original lenmar 2000mah batteries still going strong holding their charge well when they new . because charger ' smart ' i often throw batteries ' top up ' even when they only half used so i full charge when i'm out ( often 15 minutes ) . never any signs memory effects . i also love fact it charges each battery independantly ( useful devices like frs radios take 3 aa batteries ) . brilliant system . sorry hear other reviewers doa , maybe quality control slipping	1
you need add some weight casing keep it so buoyant- we put some shot large pill bottle tied it shoe string . controls easy use , it gives nice , clear picture . good buy filming any water-related activites	-1

we bought this camera film our new baby . it perfect , easy use great price . i researched lot before i decided this one i am very glad i . picture quality great .	1
i am just getting around reviewing this camera after purchasing it 2 years ago . i love it ; it good first or second digital camera , it functional but without too many features beginner . i use it both personal my job newsletter editor -- 4mp more than enough get quality images resolution required publishing	-1
i only got this a430 few days ago so i haven't used it extensively ye t.t onight i compared flash photos my book case 1 metre using my pentax ist ds 6megapixel slr a430 . i took number pictures difference pretty well zero using my 17inch monitor . i say i impressed i expecting more difference favour my slr . autofocus a430 excellent very reliable . i tried few shots complete darkness ir beam made short work focussing firing flash giving perfect image . i am also very impressed video images picture very sharp clear good sound . it lack manual featurs slr there no information actual viewfinder . it hard criticise this camera . it doesn't even look or feel cheap even though it only cost $159aud . it feels lovely hand camera you proud own . batteries lasting well too even though i snapping away it several days . i am using 512m sd card my slr camera moment 16m supplied one pretty inadequate . all all great camera great price	1
this very best pocket camera i've able find , including brand new nikon p5000 which i just bought found inferior . i'm not saying i love it -- fact i'd actually prefer pain bringing dslr over limitations this camera whenever possible -- but it avoids flaws damage competitors . first all , it fits comfortably your pocket . it big but lens retracts nice way . unlike 10 mg lumix pocket camera which lens protrusion issue . far quality , here scoop . 1 ) pictures low iso highest quality indoor pics i've able get pocket camera . i've tried them all . higher iso it starts suck but so all competition it seems . 2 ) movies * extraordinary . * absolutely rock solid video sound great too ( very very rare ) . 3 ) it take wide angle converter , telephoto converter , hotshoe flash feature . note following drawbacks , but these common all pocket cams it seems . 1 ) useless viewfinder2 ) small aperture , completely useless putting background out focus . ( however , there just enough change focus emphasis you get tad 3d effect , but it very subtle ) . again , i able find no pocket camera fast ( large ) aperture . g6 one but otherwise -- i assure you -- inferior this camera .	1
this battery all it says it . i'm ex-pro just used battery trip haiti where i got pro again week . i used this battery its previous version , charging one while shooting other . they both charged pretty quickly , newer one charging bit faster . my 4 megapixel camera i able get half-day worth photos out both	1
i really like this camera . i especially enjoy video capture sound feature . took it kings island very pleased it functionality . picture quality amazing it very user friendly . very large lcd screen . i wish it optional view finder but i knew when i purchased it . i would like find alternate power cord it capable using . should included purchase	1
camera arrived very quickly . software installation took 2 minutes seems much simplified compared software earlier nikon camera . i am still finding how apply some features various ' picture taking ' situations . external power source correct media card it even take 25-minute movie sound	1
i use depend this my slr camera now my flat bed scanner . i need both clean . this works great . i'll order it again !	1
first . let me get something off my chest . it picture frame ! no one would buy picture frame horsepower render 10mb photos . i imagine device like would several hundred dollars . my wife complained performance wanted me send it back . i ready it until i realized what this thing really . i decided play device prove myself it worked " advertised " . i collected bunch her favorite photos mp3 file don henley " get over it " put frame slideshow mode 1 second display . conversation over we kept frame , although now i am responsible maintenance . reality this device everything advertised . it disgustingly easy use . it boasts wonderfully clear display brilliant colors . it provide hours photo viewing enjoyment . i figure 100 sheets quality photo paper two printer ink refills covers cost frame . i've read elsewhere , i too take frame apart clean glass . it easy enough , but careful because frame delicate . i put scratch it my fingernail ... down wood . if digital spectrum reading this ... fix your assembly process . performance : make this product work " advertised " photos got made small ... i mean really small . i found optimal size image should under 200k . means you simply can't take media out your camera expect photo frame render series 4mb files 10 seconds or less . while frame eventually display photos don't expect it so quickly , it just doesn't capacity it . so what all this mean you ? well , it means you've got some work . you're going learn some file management techniques . you need keep originals safe while you resize copies under 200k . but hey ... disk space cheap these days ... right ? once you get photos reasonable size , copy them off your memory device choice plug it frame enjoy . if you can't deal extra hassles you can't call yourself early adopter .	-1
not bad case , but not worth money . your pocket works just well	-1
this camera packs surprising punch little package . " pause " zoom doesn't bother me all . however , i video quality bit better . then again , if i want take lot videos , maybe i should go buy video camera ..	-1
i can't speak all advanced , fancy manual options some highly advanced photography professionals seem use rate cameras . i say what most important me choosing this camera : 1 . good flash range indoor shots beyond 10 feet . 2 . quick focus reset so it i take one or more pictures quickly without wait camera reset . 3 . realtively small size excellent viewfinder . 4 . high quality pictures without huge complexity . this camera excellent these areas . i would hightly recommend this someone who wants great pictures realatively small camera without spending ton advanced features most people never use ( although these features may available this camera - don't know don't care )	1
this camera wonderful . novice i am , it perfect . basic mode very user friendly . lcd menus great . i purchased this model primarily due 12x optical zoom not disappointed . this model advanced modes i hope master my digital knowledge grows . if you're looking camera easy use excellent features , i highly recommend dmc-fz8	1
first time video camera owner i found this camera simple use intuitive . i turned it out box just started use it without needing read any instructions . simple	1
pros : great price compact . it powers up quickly ready catch quick shot . touch screen menu works great ( see cons)cons : not come mem card(but who would expect ) . touch screen works gets dirty since it also your lcd i found i clean it often . i shot mainly outdoors video great , indoors there added noise , but what you expect ... its $350 camera .	1
this camera takes great looking pictures right out box . it very easy setup shoot . you go using presets built into camera , or go totally manual . what sold me camera fact i could use lenses my minolta camera . i would highly recommend this camera anyone considering buying dslr first time , or not .	1
bit tricky set up , but nothing special standards today technology . excellent feature	1
this camera awsome cause you store music it take pictures too , one only stupid things ... it doesn't work tripod so , i suggest you don't buy tripod if you buy this camera	-1
flash works wonders . my wife i bought it my son 17th b-day passing his driving test one take . he enjoys flash it creates nice picture his new olympus camera he got x-mas	1
i bought this so we could get better look birds our backyard . we keep it kitchen window , find ourselves using it least once week peek feathered friend who visiting . nice clear lens , pretty easy find objects through them . certainly job we need it . don't buy this if you your birding out field - these not particularly portable nor leightweight not meant ; buy binocular specifically made purpose . only complaint , it minor , i find lens caps flimsy little hard use . we generally just keep them off	-1
i bought camera picture printer my 9-year old grandson . he quickly mastered it taking beautiful pictures minimal supervision . only problem paper ink kits expensive	-1
this charger very compact sturdy . prongs connect electric outlet fold into case which very nice feature	1
i've used several digital cameras past this one my favorite . it fewest number confusing buttons ( especially no awkward , symbol-laden dial around on/off button ) most menus pretty self explanatory . its highly compact very durable -- i took mine cross-country trip through middle desert . , course , it best picture quality all cameras i've used . admittedly , it hard get pictures low light ( shutter remain open while capture enough photons , resulting blurry picture if you hold it your hands ) , but this camera hole bottom screw-in tripod stabilization . plus , its one cheaper brands out there . best bet my money .	1
best thing lcd displays all information you need know charging batteries - how much longer it go ? i've used this product more than six months it works stable it . great product ! little con misleading web page , others mentioned , it charge only one battery time . since it not product fault , i still rate it 5 stars product	1
product genuine canon battery fit my sd550 promised . i've bought cheap one off ebay before after losing my oem one , highly disappointed it 5 minute battery life . this battery legit they come lasted just long my original battery , great deal price . deifnitely must buy if you're looking similar battery	1
i'm not entirely sure what there like or not like this product ... one end fits into camera hole , other into usb port , all well	1
this 58mm adaptor arrived very quickly brand-new condition , works precisely expected specified . i purchased 58mm filters locally , no problems . i am pleased transaction	1

just took two week vacation , took my binoculars . binoculars very compact ( easy pack ) very clear view zoom feature stellar , saw mule deer using 8 power , 16 gave me closer view 24 gave me perfect rack view . all all , binoculars even better my purposes than i expected ) very satisfied !!!	1
this unit records video straight mini-dvd disks . you plug unit into tv play back , you play back lcd , you finalize disk put it into standard dvd player , or computer dvd drive . unit comes software install your pc you then use edit video clips , then re-burn new dvd if you dvd burner your pc . zoom function this unit it so powerful it absurd . it standard 40x optical zoom more than enough . top it digital zoom you program 80x or totally insane 2000x . i zoom single letter word , small print book , 50ft away , then letter disappears turns pixels . it " widescreen " setting video options , manual not say this model records widescreen , but it ! it also really cool nightshot feature uses infrared radiation so you film total darkness . sound quality this unit what most impressed me . very clear , it dolby 5.1 surround converter . it weighs less than 1 pound , battery lasts 90 recording minutes full charge .	1
i mine over year , i * love * this camera ! it so easy use , takes great pictures , very easy use program etc ... i love everything this camera . ps : unlike other poster , i not any battery problems all	1
i purchased two these cameras same time intentions making anaglyph ( red/blue 3d ) movies . while i agree picture quality leaves bit desired , these cameras just too much fun . ease use great , dual-camera rig 3d movies $200 grea t.t he picture quality akin 3mp , so don't let advertisement fool you . even still , i've printed off few these pictures photo paper i found results more than satisfactory . audio quality subpar my ears . however , this wasn't factor me , since i'm using my audio studio capture all my audio tracks . i later combine audio video through editing software . if you're serious your film projects , you're probably going want get something higher quality , this product quality like digital version vhs ( ie it pixelated little bit blurry fast movements ) . however , if you're looking fun video camera making your own home video or amateur project , this thing fine . plugged straight camera tv , semi-stationary video turn out just fine . i would recommend getting good tripod most applications . quality picture directly affected how much camera moves , so good , smooth tripod eliminate lot	-1
lense everything it advertised reasonable price	-1
i've this camera now few months love it . picture quality great , 16:9 view works great . i haven't taken too much low light movies yet so i'll wait see how picture quality scenario . only difficulty i've getting still images off card . i firewire cable i've used capture video but image software came camera doesn't seem recognize camera when it attached firewire cable . i'll get usb cable see if resolves issue	-1
i'm not pro any means , but this camera fantastic . zoom really impressive clarity great ( again ... i'm not pro , just someone who loves take pictures ) . folks who complained detachable lens cap ... it really not big deal . there small strap packaged camera , which very simple attach , connect lens cap camera . same strap also attaches wrist strap camera	1
bought this my husband birthday , he carry it around his shirt pocket . it great not carry batteries , it recharges it own cradle . batteries seem last fair amount time . it takes pictures quickly also . my son i received different models casio cameras christmas we both very happy	1
this my first digital camera . basics easy learn simple master . however , coolpix so many capabilities , it may months before i get most them . i try get it download wirelessly initially , but unable master , but included wire , it very easy download . perhaps after using it awhile , re-reading manual , i'll figure it out . i bought extra battery when shooting many pictures event , but i yet need it . battery lasts long time , even when shooting all pix flash . it take couple seconds recover flash , but it seems good/acceptable me . i never yet needed second battery even when taking 50+ pictues . one suggestion , though would way see level battery charge . you definitely need memory card . camera only good dozen pictures or so without one . overall , i'm very satisfied look forward learning much my new coolpi	1
this great little frame money . it easy use . this one replace trutech one i purchased locally returned . trutech difficult operate poor quality screen . matsunichi very easy use , much less expensive , showed clearer pictures . i'm sure there some out there much better resolution , however , money , this one great . i am very pleased	1

i very pleased get this battery which i am using alternate my p850 digital camera . battery lasts very long time , so long fact it easy forget just how long you using it since last charge . power meter camera doesn't show gradual decrease , but rather shows rapid loss last dozen shots . result i keep one camera one fully charged camera case . when one goes down i swap then charge other when i get back where i . charge cycle full charge seems long , 4 hours . but way i am using it ( swapping ) way charged battery lasts camera there no problem . no regrets	1
got this my dad christmas . my brother then went europe 1 week later took it him . he no trouble all . i don't know if we find it easy because we both own analog hi-8 version camera this just easy transition us or if it just easy use . it not play old tapes our analog recorders which we knew buying it so don't say nobody told you when you get yours can't play back tapes ! no problems video or audio either . overall it great camera price .	-1

while i am nowhere close pro , i am not stranger photography or digitals . recently i wanted something better than what i upcoming trip italy i bought lumix dmc-lx2 amazon after reading reviews , etc . it no slr , but it far more than " back-up " camera . it small enough handy without burden . ( friend we travelling digital slr 135mm zoom . she it her bag most time because it so big heavy . ) lens quality very good . absence traditional view finder very nice . tv screen back works all lighting conditions ( its adjustable ) . you little or lot technical data screen you want . it even couple nice composition templates i found useful times . i bought one after market batteries couple 2 gig cards i far more capacity than i needed 2 week trip , but second card necessary if you shoot max pixels i whole time . max jpg 2 gig card holds 350 shots . one battery all i needed so long i watched charger carefully night . sometimes current converter one use italy would shut down mid-charge . so my advice second battery switch them ou t.t his camera very versatile . it lot if one takes time study manual . ( manual not best , however ) slr beat out its zoom , but not much problem casual shooting because one crop tar out 10.1 mg shots still great photo . flash works fine . one fill flash it . i bought small slave unit works great but i never needed it . i found handy , cheap , case rei . they padded cell phone case hooks up belt or back pack . this camera fits rei case perfectly . it even side mesh pockets batteries chips . i forget price but i think it less than 20 bucks .	1
i purchased this $100 less than best buy . i am very happy kodak easy share . it easy set up printer works like magi	1
i owned this lens over year now it never ceases amaze me when i see photos it produces . over this last year i come learn thing or two how use this lens . 1 ) if you going shoot indoors , or low light , long focal length ( like 200mm ) use tripod or plenty ambient light . this lens doesn't built image stabilizer so you going steady lens tripod or use real fast shutter speed minimize your hand jitter . 2 ) use smaller aperture . i found my best photos come aperture 8.0 thru 16 . these apertures aren't great bokeh ( background blur ) but they sure allow you take razor sharp pictures . praise . focal range . one lens you able take nice wide-angle shots ( 18mm ) twist zoom ring you nice telephoto lens ( 200mm ) definitely good walk around lens day botanical gardens , museum or amusement park . build quality . this lens gives you nice solid feel your hands . give it shake it doesn't make sound . zoom focus rings move smoothly without sloppy . lens this well built you would expect it heavy . not so this lens , it quite light ( which something you really appreciate after long day carrying it around . ) minimal chromatic aberrations . lens ' three hybrid aspherical elements two low dispersion glass elements correct almost all lateral on-axis aberrations making most your images optically clear . size . it lowest focal length ( 18mm ) lens small enough fit into mid size top loading camera bag while still attached camera body . complaint ? well yes , i one minor complaint lens . auto focus slow . how slow ? well let just say you won't want try photograph two year old move . i found i keep fast moving objects better focus switching manual	1

compact so it fits you pocket , high tech enough dance it bigger counterparts . this little camera it all . i comparison shopped several weeks comparing contrasting multiple cameras cannon , kodak , hp , sony , panasonic , olympus , none features like this , small size , this price range . upgrades form old 710 5x optical zoom 5.6 digital zoom ( 28x total ) up close , excellent photos , dual image stabilization . 7.1 megapixels , dual image stabilization ( both digital optical stabilization shake free pictures new 750 760 models ) , 2.5 inch lcd viewing screen , low price what you get . oh , i mention excellent pictures . i played this several days now editing photos , paling on-board computer imaging package , i see nothing wrong this camera everyday average user like me . it weather resistence , nice clumsy average user like me . also battery life very adequate , 120 photos or more , slide shows , editing ect ... this well worth investment , saving your families memories fit proper manner . olympus master software you computer very easy use , panoramic feature , 3d , extra art features unlocked olympus brand-olympus stamped type hd , this camera becomes even more pleasure own . you edit photos computer , or right palm your hand . both ways , this camera make you feel like pro no time .	1

you know feeling ... one you get after taking bunch indoor shots you think turned out great , but look really crappy your computer then you waste tons time trying photshop pics , well that feeling i every compact digital camera i've owned . this especially disappointing when you important events like birthdays , weddings , etc . indoor pics turn out bad . trust me check out this camera . you shocked how noise free indoor pics ( even iso 800 w/o flash ) . i don't know non-slr camera takes indoor pics this well . build quality superb ( all metal construction ) . only things i don't like : no separate battery charger included ( you must charge camera ) , no viewfinder , xd card format . those minor quibbles i would trade them any day fantastic indoor pics . i am photography enthusiast canon fan ( over $3k bodies lenses ) my main camera rebel xti . however , i've got give fuji lot credit focusing pic quality rather than getting into megapixel war . don't fooled megapixel myths . this camera may lower mp but it very large ccd sensor compact camera . gods sake don't buy camera based looks !!! you really care what camera looks like or you care pictures ??? also , optical image stabilization ( ois ) seems latest rage . who cares if camera ois , but takes crappy indoor pics ? this reason i passed canon sd800 .	1
i purchased this item mainly bird watching . i own two canon lenses technology i really appreciate value brings . i tried other binoculars same range found canon 10x30 outperforms all them . image clarity excellent . works great reduces eye strain great extend . compact design light weight help you carry binocular your other photography gears field guides . only drawback i could find not lens cover object lens . aware , this binocular water resistant , not water proof . overall great investment . i would recommend this anyone looking good binocular bird watching sports .	-1
great choice first time buyers . this camera easy learn it advanced features you learn you go ... when you master these you realize you shooting like pro . vast array nikon lenses accessories big selling point me ability control nikon speedlights remotely via camera some really great shooting setups . d200 my dream come true . it provides all professional features amateur would want price affordable . d200 incorporates most latest enhancements available digital imaging including 10 megapixel censor , matrix ii metering , detailed battery indicator , large buffer continuous shoots much much more . buy this nikon	1
great pictures , fast response time . good resolution little ultra compact . why pay sony t10 , when this so much less , takes standard sd memory like my old camera . memory stick change major reason why i wont change over sony . nikon shines this one	1
this great little unit , if you get it under $50 . more than it limitations drive you nuts . battery life : grea t.t ransfering photos : drag drop card reader sd card ... great . i not tried using easy-share software transfer . viewing : great , but .... previous reviewer said , you can't organize photos into folders . see photo , you need scroll through entire card . this really makes it useful only few photos . i love it able carry few photos around show friends , but remember , that few due navigation limitations . kodak , please release firmware fix address this , this thing goes 5 stars plus !!	-1
i love my tripod . it sturdy easy use . my only problem i lost one my quick release shoes . i'm looking more . i'm not sure they sell them seperately . would shame . however , tripod itself great . enjoy .	1
this lens great - very sharp well worth money . especially since nikon version twice much - this lens wider ( 10mm vs . nikon 12mm ) ... some complained " distortion " 10mm , true , there some , but that what i like it . what fun wide angle if no one tell it wide angle ? if you fence , buy it . you won't regret it	1
took mine trip caicos island where it promptly dropped , mauled possibly even slightly neglected ( i never soaked it after bringing it out saltwater ) . worked without flaw . just easy use without case . if you've got kids , pete sake buy one these . while making it not only virtually trash proof , it enables you take it places you would probably never take your digital camera otherwise ... beach , pool . forget it ! got mine scuba.com $150	1
hello , i'm glad this product , i haven't try it yet outside my house but really dark condition it works pretty well , i need turn ir button clearly i read even sign bottle total darkness . this thing really work	1
this my second digital camera ; i've using most recently nikon 35mm though it probably isn't fair make comparisons , i find this little digital every bit responsive easy use 35mm . i haven't noticed any lack speed shooting , etc . maybe that because this camera used mostly pleasure rather than business , so i take more relaxed attitude . i think price all options it offer , l6 fine choice i would not hesitate recommend it . i'm merely hobbyist when it comes photography , again , maybe that why my attitude more relaxed . i don't demand anything much other than good final product , my new l6 delivers	1
this charger pretty amazing ! it smallest most compact one market , plus it comes car charger . charges 90 minutes or so . if you looking compact , this it , it good looks too !!	1
this may not most expensive filter but it works great my digital camera . it well worth money low cost encourage you replace it when it eventually get scratched	1
this awesome little camera . except you can't use it night ! there horrible white spots nighttime photos when flash used . apparently these appear because flash so close lens this camera , so dust reflects badly . it known problem [ ... ] also , it totally annoying sony uses all their proprietary technology . result , cable connecting this camera computer unwieldly ( uhh , you heard usb ??!! ) , you buy sony memory stick , which probably won't work anything else you . flipside , you take movies aren't limited 30 seconds this guy - i think might result memory stick technology . but other than , design operation this little guy seems pretty slick . lens not one those pops out , so not sure if affects image quality all , but far i could tell , quality good . end , what good camera can't take usable pictures its flash ??	-1
guide number correct , but ... it so small ; -	-1
this my second rangefinder bushnell . first one scout , which excellent product but could not get pin beyond 200 yards . this version gets pin out 400 or so , depending conditions . it little bulkier than scout , but you get 7x magnification much better optics looking green . you range any object course , like lip bunker , far side pond , tree , etc . know exactly how far you need carry ball . this flexibility makes laser much better than any gps , you don't pay subscription or participating course use laser , it works anywhere . laser rangefinder improve your game first allowing you learn what distance you hit every club bag , there no guessing , you get instant feedback . second if you play strange courses often it allows you see hole plan strategy tee . it also amazing how many courses yardage markers incorrect .	1
very speedy delivery . gift my daughter . she loves it . i thought we receive free photo card but not . not really necessary . not know . still playing it blast . i like it weather resistant	1
this case worked very well , without adding lot weight or bulk camera . i took it snorkeling ( watertight 12 feet ) , white water rafting snow skiing , it worked well . all controls accessible , it doesn't fog up if you follow acclimatization tips it keeps valuable camera dry . only thing watch you keep wrist strap out way when putting camera into case , so you don't crimp seals	-1
this one those line item purchases flies face conventional . this tripod combo meets need no extravagant bells whistles . it well designed engineered weight materials quite acceptable fit finish price . i actually smile incessantly using this combo	-1
i used battery past few months past few months together two canon batteries . i not went out my way compare their battery life , but not discern notable difference among them	1
this very good point shoot digital camera ! i tested cameras all major manufacturers decided this one my wife one simple reason - shutter lag time almost non-existant . it almost like using film camera . picture quality decent , movie quality . if you want fast reacting point shoot digital camera , this it .	-1
light , easy use adjust , classy looking .... its sony ! i am very pleased vctr640 would highly recommend it . it very stable pans ease . you spend more .... but you not find better product !	1
this film really good one - i used 3 rolls these films very happy . i also used ilford xp2 super - but , i prefer kodak film . i taken several portraits just home decoration light-stand desk lamp - film exposed correctly because higher asa . also , i like convinience printing local shop . development cost same color printing - it best way get bw print cheap	-1
it good fit e-900 . it doesn't center hole flap lanyard . it leather flap , rest nylon	-1
it works perfectly ! sure it bit pain adapter attach lens camera but it so simple use . it attaches very smoothly easily both lens camera . mount very secure stable . yes there bit " tunnel " effect until you use w/t function camera but overall it works great	1
pros : video quality gl2 excellent good lighting still good low light but noticeable noise . image stabilizer works great even if you don't steady hand , even full telephoto won't make you nauseous . analog digital feature nice able convert just anything digital . full manual controls great anyone who wants control how their video comes out . automatic modes pretty good but that not why you would buy this camera . even automatic focus aperture work good but kind slow . this work your advantage if someone walks front camera or you pan past window , but if it loses focus or changes aperture it doesn't bounce right back . cons : this camera notorious faulty tape decks . if it doesn't give eject tape message it still requires constant cleaning head cleaning tape , every 5 hours horizontal lines appear lcd . photo feature kind pointless , only 1.7 megapixels , anyone who could afford this camera would already camera would take better pictures . it can't used while recording , requires seperate shooting mode . summary : all around great camera but gets dirty easily . video quality manual controls top notch .	-1
i photography hobby over 20 years . i love pentax cameras because lightness lens compatibility this best slr i ever . i still need test some its features . but i am very happy quality pictures . i upgraded istds i got two years back . shake reduction come very useful when i take pictures my 2 year old son who not stay one place . i used get many blurred images ist ds low shutter speeds this camera handles very well . colors very natural i like fact i save images both raw jpeg same time . i usually use raw store my images jpeg web email . image processor may not good what u may find nikon or canon but raw images very impressive . i think i finally got right camera really replace my older film based pentax slr still i use all those expensive lenses i without spend more money . if u owner pentax slr many lenses wants go digital , there no better choice than k10d unless u lot money invest camera new lenses	1
this my first digital camera , i lot search finaly i decide dsc-w55 black , what i looking , small enough it my purse , lot functions , very easy import pictures my computer , you only connect camera usb cable you don't need install software came camera , i windows vista i didn't any problems transfering pictures , best camera price great , you choose super saver shipping save more . you love this camera too , small , very pretty , lots options , take great pictures . some one wrote review this camera feels like plastic , that not true , looks very durable me i think good product worth every single dollar you spend . easy shoot pictures auto adjustment mode , start taking pictures sooner you charge battery , because this camera internal memory you buy memory card later . well hope you lots fun taking pictures , good luck ..!	1
if you ignore one star rviews some people actually giving reviewers(in which they correct doing so , but incorrect reviewing battery it ) then you would see average go up . i buy these all time my d550z . i alot research not only this best battery solution d550 , it pretty good one . d550z your common camera takes great pictures . these batteries last long time , we young baby we both photographers taken over 3,000 pictures last sixteen months , number not exagerated . these batteries generally last two or three months . sometimes flash , sometimes screen . short , these batteries great your basic common camera eaten up power hungry cameras like e10 20 . they last way longer than alkalines nimh . i personally don't like rechargable solution because you spend lot time charging batteries die quickly . every time you load these batteries you going change nimh 3 times charge total 5 hours . charging much time expensive itself . $15 every two three months , amount we shoot , bargain , bargain over time spent . these should last regular point shooter much longer	1
i got en-el3a free replacement recalled en-el3 battery . ( check nikonusa dot com see if your en-el3 recalled . ) it perfect my d70 -- reviewer pointed out , it gives you slightly more power juice -- 7% more . if you looking buy official nikon battery this good value . btw you find generic brands ( also here amazon.com ) $20 . i'm not saying whether you should buy nikon or generic oem one . after all , nikon screwed up en-el3 so i can't vouch their safety . like original en-el3 this likely made china	1
i've this camcorder week now i think it works great .. except touch screen feature . takes little getting used .. especially when accessing special features ( such fader effects ) while filming . digital still quality poor when recording directly memory stick .. but same images taken still prerecorded tape much clearer . all all it good product .. just takes some getting used	-1
this amazing compact camera , all wanted features . i looking camera compact good optical zoom well takes gr8 pictures . i stunned how much this little thing deliver . it just too amazing ... i would definitely recommend it . ps : there lots better camera available similar or better features , but they come large price .	1
i ended up buying this camera ( even though i heard bad things kodak ) because i liked feel it my hand . i don't like small thin cameras . it somewhere point shoot slr . since i can't afford slr i went this . i say i love camera . i already shot enough pics printed them my printer they came out great . i love all features . it reminds me my 35mm slr i still own use time time . i don't find any lag taking pictures . however , if you auto shoot , it needs focus first before you take shot . but my 35mm slr same thing . i thinkg shutter just fine . i would reccommend this camera someone who needs upgrade point shoot . after reading reviews , i am seriously thinking getting extended warranty it . escpecially since my last camera crapped out me 1 1/2 years later . only thing i seem problem my fingers like hit control buttons right side camera while i am trying take picture . it could i am lefty all controls right side . but price , you can't go wrong .	-1
this battery awsome charges 2 hours or less actualy good 150 pics or more promised . you get one knockoff batteries sell here amazon $6.88 far i tell works just good . i one each but only few days now each through full charge drain i noticed no difference them	1

picture taking my life !! i would almost board family functions without camra my hands . i got my vivitar camra pawn shop $10 it amazing . i took it my papa house over summer i got some beutiful pictures . this easy camra work i love way it takes vidio even if it soundless . 4th july i took some videos fireworks it so much fun look even without sound . this not my first camra what so ever . i many other camras camras cost well over 500 dollors , but this camra just fine me . only thing i don't like it zoom . when you zoom like 4x it makes picture really blurry . but if you expirenced photo taking it shouldn't problem . i recommend this camra i thinkj it good find .	1
when i bought this camera i no idea potential this little powerhouse would bring . i took this italy trip my dad proceeded take 800 pictures . my two weeks journey through rome , venice , florence , southern italy , i slowly learned many features settings this camera offer . people amazed clarity , how professional each picture looks . this camera ! stephen john becciaauthor treelanders -- journey giants	1
this isn't professional camera but snapshots , its dream ! its very easy use if you handle camera like any 10 year old would . ( just start hitting buttons , till you've figured out how it works . ) my only issue taking pictures trees flowers . there setting this scene , but no matter what i , shots come out almost unreal looking . pictures people come out great ! :) software useless unless you windows 98 , but camera itself works without software any higher programs like xp . i hoping make larger prints this camera , but i'm beginning think its not going produce anything larger than 8 1/2 11 . i think its partly fault digital printers thoough	-1
i noticed over all performance upgrade my canon a630 since purchasing these batteries . they last long time camera operates faster all together . lag time reduced photos trememndously	1

good camera $129 i paid . everything pretty well , your picture modes pretty customizable . only qualm it takes second or two longer than i wish when camera saves/loads pictures memory card . might problem when trying shoot consecutive pictures -- but probably wouldn't doing it this type camera anyways .	-1
great simple case your compact camera ... slick design combing hard soft case .. extra pouch great spare battery or card	1
this my fifth digital camera , i like it best far . it also cheapest . it my first wide-angle my first silver-not-black : someone else said , i don't see how i would ever go back non-wide-angle after this ; but i wish mine black . i noticed colors faded fluorescent light , but macro it excellent -- much better than more expensive camera i already bought macro purposes ( canon . ) i also love battery , which seems last forever . i bought replacement lenmar battery which also great , cheap , but it got some bad reviews because it described wrong model camera , not fx-01 . ( if you read customer reviews , you figure out which one right one you . ) i problems understanding display , which shows options don't correspond any place camera you select options . ( i guess i should look manual . ) also , i don't like software decided not download it all . i bought this because i wanted camera made computer company much camera company , , i wanted it work . also , someone sent me email history leica , how they saved lot jews concentration camps . other nice thing this camera i use it lot more because i carry it me every day : it tiny battery always works , so why not ? graininess , my desktop pics look fine , i would not raving this camera if it not very easy take good pics -- but i admit i haven't used it printed pics so far	1

i waiting affordable nikon digital slr which i could use my older nikon lenses ( ai , series , etc . ) . i know , i could spent thousands d2 , but would overkill me . suffice say , d200 joy use . it fast , solid , intuitive . those owners nikon film slrs who considering d200 , me it " feels " just like nikon film slr . i previously owned several high-end digital point shoot cameras , d200 blows them away terms its capabilities , degree control it offers , resulting quality pictures you take it . it all features advanced amateur photographer could possibly want . i'll probably never even scratch surface all its features , but its nice know they're there if i want or need them . i highly recommend d200 anyone who , like me , waiting right digital slr come	1
i received product promptly it works perfectly my battery . i little worried my battery would not fit . however it perfect match . i'd buy again amazon	1
i now two pairs these binocs ( 1st set stolen my car ) . prior i canon 10x30 binocs , pair swarovski 8x32 years ago some leica 10x40 trinovids . my main use them birdwatching , though i use them other purposes . i disagree prior reviewer who would not recommend these birdwatching ... if you handle weight . works brilliantly . my experience view through these blows away view one get any non-is binocs ( leicas , nikon , etc ) . 10x42 much larger heavier than 10x30 binocs , however you gain ( 1 ) significantly brighter , more contrasty view , ( 2 ) much wider field view , ( 3 ) great ruggedness waterproofness . downsides minor : ( 1 ) i mention they heavy ? ( canon provides thick neoprene strap - you might consider one those behind-the-back shoulder straps , ( 2 ) anodizing unarmormed part body wears off way too quickly , making them look more used than they ( both pairs i've owned ) , ( 3 ) glass objectives barely rececessed making it too easy get fingerprints glass . however , first time you get some beautiful bird binocs , color knock your socks off detail you see amaze you . now , if they could just lighter cheaper ...	1
