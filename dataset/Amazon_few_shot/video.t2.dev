my main motivation seeing this movie better understand reputation echo park , little area nestled next downtown los angeles . i moved echo park late 2004 . it depressing - vicious cycle drugs , dropping-out , domestic violence . it all here , told through eyes latina teenagers . it easy see woman hand direction piece important roles women played . i didn't care movie whole because it felt sluggish uneven . i also found myself not caring any characters . so-and-so gets shot , la la loo goes jail . whatever ! aside , though , evil neighborhood druglord called ernesto . it turns out my next-door neighbor real-life also called ernesto . luckily , it just coincidence	1
i bought this dvd because it features alan rickman . i also purchased it because someone else amazon review ( they sounded like they really knew what they talking ) . i am glad i bought it used , because if it new , i would feel i'd cheated . movie suspenseful waiting doctor office . there no sense suspense , i thrilled chilled lukewarm cup tea ( mind you , i'm not type who requires non-stop action special effects happy ) . dialogue throughout tedious trite ; scriptwriter should unemployment line , well director editor . plot , some respects , totally illogical , other times nonsensical . even previous scenes don't tie neatly enough end . plot entirely unconvincing implausible . choices characters make - whether restless , bored , frustrated - don't tie normal patterns logic suck all realism away film ( like greedy , unwashed vampire ) . movie features wealthy , bored couple . i also bored . but i'm not wealthy . however ! all actors their best within limitations this film . polly walker very convincing sensitive , but hypercritical wife . fact , i'd say she provided best performance , her character most three-dimensional human . they should provided more time make audience more sympathetic her character . norman reedus fairly genuine young man , although he seemed more creepy psychotic than attractive . he failed grab my empathy . which makes plot movie more implausible ... jaded , wealthy couple would allowed him into their environment . alan rickman his usual subtle work , but it so subtle i thought they might not let him his morning coffee before filming . his attempt american accent not fly too well . later movie , however , he becomes much more interesting . end lacked passion not surprising all ; it entirely predictable . rickmanistas , yes , you get see alan naked . so , just fast forward end movie you happy . i always admired alan rickman - i'm big fan - but he would better more skillfully scripted directed film . so , i give it two stars . * yawn	1
three problems this film : 1 . pacing - film pacing doesn't vary . it very boring . matter fact , this wouldn't problem if film much more tense ( e.g. , " speed " ) , however this film lacks high-action intensity pull off such slow expository speed . 2 . effects - too many sequences this film rely color light superimpositions , there overabundance high-speed imaging . scene changes employ erratic barrages images desensitize viewer thrilling " horror " scenes . furthermore , they fail make enough sequential sense film plot really mean much film greater whole . upshot : film relies too heavily art editing , point where plot twists no longer interesting . 3 . triviality - plot conclusion quails face " so what ? " question . viewer left sense , " i sat through film ? " light points ( 1 ) ( 2 ) , this obnoxious bit icing cake . don't waste your life . alon	-1
what wild things 2 going against it get-go : ) no denise richards ) no name actors c)being crappy direc t-t o-video sequel d)no denise richards naked . . . what wrong wild things 2 after fact : a)a script tries overcompensate its idiocy more twists than corkscrew b)one sex scene -- ( weak ) threesome , one few things even linking this original c)sexy actresses who star sexy movie but decide not naked ( leaving us body double naked-from-behind shot ) . . . wait let me play again ! if i seem dwelling little too much sexuality aspects this film maybe its because this erotic thriller . i mention no denise richards ?	-1
next generation basically remake original texas chainsaw massacre , fact up hour into film plot practically identical , though different characters locations used . original little overrated my opinion this " remake " quite frankly terrible . bad acting exception renee zellweger matthew mcconaughy who their best terrible script several movie actors . only major differences original leatherface now dresses woman , which fairly amusing but hardly essential , tacked conspiracy theory . conspiracy theory secret society only surfaces last half hour absolutely ridiculous , i won't explain it , theres no point , watch it yourself if you want know how stupidly film ends . i would sooner suggest avoiding this film completely though , even die hards admit its awful , i only gave it 2 stars because i reserve 1 star very worst worst ( yes even worse than this ! )	1

oriental i am fairly familiar films released our geographical neighbours , although not extensive standard hollywood productions . japanese films , whether it made kurusawa or more obscure artisan , i fairly adjudged them whole lethargic pace , inconspicuously lacks background music/instrumentals , generally pressed celluluid films simply comparatively substandard . village dreams , while touted award winner glaring testimony this stunted japanese film-making characteristic . review it yourself . pace alone wantingly needs tighter editing . it same character seen even kurusawa ran - quot ; highly acclaimedquot ; work my case , i couldn't even view third time , because even its dvd resolution quality only likened eye-view person who suffering his earliest stage creeping glaucoma . village dreams so quot ; relaxedquot ; if filmmaker expects people like me available time they enjoyed 1940s japan obscure countryside . very least , straight narrative this film consolation , but ran , actions so hard follow , you'd puzzled who fighting attacking whom . most unforgivable quality this dvd transfer poor film stock . picture approximates quot ; third generationquot ; recording vhs copy . this means you'll sorely dissapointed get vhs-quality copy copied , turn , vhs copy which copied original vhs quot ; master tapequot ; . course , dvd transfer not fault , its simply japanese despite their touted techno prowess just couldn't give us decent film stock , could least preserve their comparatively well-made gems . glaring deficiency films like this comes even more obvious , when shown high resolution tvs . i've viewed this film 29-inch sony wega flat tv , 50-inch mitsubishi projection tv , pioneer dvl 919 909 . if not antics two children leads , village comes off wearisome . i bought this film despite its hefty price tag mainly because i'm film collector . its works like this whets my appreciation world cinema . unfortunately , village poor resolution takes away gratifying cinematic enjoyment , well negating its quot ; collectabilityquot ; factor . this should looked more glorious if it could approximate celluluid quality examples like what dreams may come or dark city , but course that asking too much those editing-challenged japanese filmakers . i want ask amazon refund because this not well worth its price value . i compulsed buy it because its cover , i thought it least exotically glorious-looking kundun , but it proved just small , obscure production . critics may raved it , just like those canadians black robe , but final word they're just run mill , albeit thoughtful , films ....	1

logan run belongs class old school science fiction films which popular early mid-1970 , prior beginning star wars franchise . these films not rely non-stop action or dazzling special effects , but rather thoughtful , intelligent stories , intriguing " what if ? " scenarios , astute social commentary . they included sci fi classics such soylent green , omega man , andromeda strain , westworld , others . while shopping mall setting some special effects logan run pretty cheesy , it still interesting film its themes may even more relevant today botox era than they 70 . i heard they doing remake would like think it improve original . unfortunately , given recent history hollywood , it more likely they drain every last bit intelligence out story , replace it more explosions , perhaps smith .	1
movie : ***** dvd quality : ***** dvd extras : *** dramas _teenage gays coming out closet ! _ so plentiful , they sometimes run together my mind . " edge seventeen " exception statement because it genuinely exceptional movie every way . screenplay todd stephens sensitive true life , or rather , many people lives . it tells story eric ( chris stafford ) , young man growing up small town sandusky , ohio , who just beginning grapple his sexual orientation . what so refreshing script eric portrayed neither victim nor hero ; he simply kid cusp adulthood who trying find himself . eric sometimes selfish thoughtless ; other times sweet naive ; occasionally manipulative ; but generally good guy ... other words : completely human . holds true other characters movie , including eric parents who love him dearly but aren't quite sure what make his fast-changing moods appearance ; his female best friend ( tina holmes ) who harbors deeper feelings him ; his new gay " family " ( headed lea delaria ) who fiercely supportive , yet sometimes insensitive where he terms his coming out process . thankfully , stephens ' screenplay remains true itself right down final fadeout doesn't cop out trying wrap everything up into neat little package ; end movie , there definite sense these characters continue live , learn , make mistakes , thrive . ( sequel , anyone ? )the entire cast uniformly outstanding . chris stafford embodies eric all his complexity ; his performance never strikes false note . tina holmes amazing his confused female friend ; more than once her face vocal inflections reminded me extremely young meryl streep ( high compliment indeed ) . stephanie mcvay distinguishes herself eric baffled mother , andersen gabrych fine eric first same sex crush whose confident veneer covers troubled heart . perhaps best all comic lea delaria , who turns warm winning dramatic performance earth mother whose wisdom understanding always available eric , regardless how hard he sometimes pushes her away . strand dvd offers flawless letterboxed transfer featuring outstanding audio video . somewhat sparse extras limited theatrical trailers " edge seventeen " five other feature films designed appeal lgbt audiences . it would wonderful additional benefit cast crew biographies filmographies reasearch tool viewers who want explore others works filmmakers , but this small complaint . overall , this truly must-see film , one worthy repeat viewings .	1

i finally made my first purchase amazon unbox video downloads just try service am happy report solid customer experience . $1.99 , i purchased downloaded one my favorite episodes " twilight zone " , it took twenty minutes download through broadband connection . i don't think it most ideal way see full-length motion pictures , but 26-minute classic tv program , i think my 17 " lcd monitor makes suitable viewing experience , video quality downloaded file clean . aired september 15 , 1961 show third season opener , episode cold war fantasy appropriately called " two " last two survivors earth , man woman , after apocalyptic world war 2109 . written directed tv veteran montgomery pittman , simple plot revolves around complicating fact he american infantryman she invading russian soldier . like two feral animals , they glare each other among debris deserted town destroyed war . he even knocks her out her after she aggressively throws pots pans him . reality their solitary existence , however , gradually dawns them , especially after they see evening dress shop window inspiring her speak her only word dialogue - " prekrassnyi " - russian word " lovely " . what really makes this episode memorable unlikely casting . two years before she twitched her nose " bewitched " , brunette elizabeth montgomery , looking appropriately ravaged sporting deadly ray gun , plays untrusting russian soldier surprising fierceness vulnerability . american played perennial tough-guy charles bronson , fresh " magnificent seven " . even though he spout some inane philosophical lines describe futility war , he leavens his natural sullenness determined romanticism . they make odd couple , but it works splendidly . i also learned canned fried chicken become staple 22nd century . narrated rod serling his inimitably halting manner , show ends my favorite line his signature postscript : " this ... love story .

i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1

great thing this " movie version " all original voices clifford ( john ritter ) , emily elizabeth , cleo , t-bone exactly same clifford episodes tv . basically , it longer version regular clifford episode but they've added few new friends some songs here there . speaking , songs actually upbeat bit catchy . but not so catchy where i find tunes stuck my head hours ........ unlike some other kid movies ( i.e. - thomas tank engine ) where they play same droning chorus over over over again . this movie great compromise because my 2 1/2 year old son loves it , after watching it him numerous times now , i still like it too .	1

" trust me : you not forget either them . walker narrates film , telling it mostly flashback style , his best-selling book . addition his mom two father-figures his life , short story frankie love affair astronomy stars , hence " frankie starlight .

i think this movie goes right heart philosophical question what art artists supposed : they merely present facts/ideas/personalities/images no comment , no moralizing , no personal ulterior motives ( leaving all those things viewer ) , or they need state clearly moral purpose certain direction ( which viewer then accept or reject) ? martin sheen kit , garbageman working south dakota ; he becomes friends 15-year-old holly ( sissy spacek ) . when her father tells sheen he doesn't want him near his daughter again , sheen kills him . two run off together , living while woods like two " innocents " some primitive society . but then they're discovered three men sheen kills them , too . they now head montana , sheen committing more murders way . he empty inside , nothing fazes him ; he imagines he like james dean - misunderstood , alienated . but he doesn't clue what he should alienated against , far misunderstood , he never once gives least hint there anything there understand . we finish watching movie feeling empty sheen . i also felt little angry malick attempt con me into thinking there more sheen vapid character than there really : he truly just non-entity who kills half score innocent people . so back my first paragraph . malick obviously works perspective first half my question posed ( view became obsession , i think , artists , writers , film-makers , etc . beginning late 1960s ); i tend toward believing second half . suum cuique	1

i singled out this book i felt i'd come fork road my life . i could choose bitter after premature birth death my son or i could try seek out better ways live my now very different life . i started this book dubious its content . i expected lectured . instead i found myself reading open mouth ; shocked how accurately my loss explained . it if this wonderfully gifted rabbi invisibly witnessed events my life , times when my relatives would say dumbest most cruel comments . instead talked , i found i reading book kind friend written just me . i am not religious or spiritual , i guess you could say i'm confused , however his book opened my eyes different , kinder religion than one i always felt judgemental . i since purchased anniversary edition this book one my most treasured possessions . if you feel life let you down , if you feel every door once open slammed your face , if you feel alone your sorrow nowhere else turn relief , this book you . it won't make pain go away , but it make pain sorrow less personal . you no longer feel `why me ' , you just realize it what it itself make your pain easier cope . this certainly how i feel upon it ending , i hope you experience same comforts	1

there dozens don't drugs flicks feel like after-school specials , their sluggish morals predictable endings . well , i say ending this movie predictable , but build-up it , acting finesse which special effects implemented ( voices going out focus , characters fast forward , teeth grinding ) me spun beginning end . though brittany murphy gets most cover , story really ross ( jason schwartzmann ) , part screwed-up extended family all hooked methamphetamines , including secondhand dealer spider mike ( john leguizamo ) , spaced-out game geek frisbee ( patrick fugit ) , others . when ross meets nikki ( murphy ) , he gets hooked up real deal : man calls himself cook , who wears boots spurs cowboy hat spits , fights , tweaks like man . movie , most part , follows ross exploits he becomes cook errand boy , ferrying nikki around exploits like taking her dog vet ( who turned green too much inhalation ) , otherwise taking cook out score , buy beer porn , etc . best part this movie dead-on behavior junkies . they hug kiss you , they reassure you pretty lies , they make you feel right home - but second they're short drugs , or you say wrong thing them , they scream throw things around . next day you're friends again until next fight , which never very far off . though you led believe through whole movie cook head cheese , it interesting ( accurate ) discover he reporting someone even bigger . yuck , personal hygiene right nose these characters - their teeth gritty , their clothes dirty raggedy , through few days we follow them it doesn't appear any one them ever takes shower . all they want - no , need - their next fix . part sold me beginning words came onscreen film started up : based truthand lies	1

this not movie you background while knitting or gutting fish or something . but those who focus it rewarded one most under-rated films all time . there isn't lot action or sex or any things appeal most movie-going crowd , but it some best acting ( serious comic ) writing imagery any film you're likely come across	1
i want two hours my life back ! after all talk what cult classic this film ! what waste time ! maybe this movie novelty american moviegoers 1973 . time past ( even then , " robots attack people " concept hardly new ) . now this just boring movie bad acting anticlimactic action . this film only good academic or nostalgic purposes . unless you doing research paper american sci-fi cinema , or you your 40s enjoyed this movie kid , or you just like boring anticlimactic movies , avoid this dull piece drivel . i feel cheated !	-1
pretty hard take well written book likes john grisham bring it all onto screen . they pretty good job . matt damon plays rudy , student law school who smart , broke , make history . meantime his partner him working hard case against scamming life insurance company never paid out boy who cancer . policy covered it but they would just not pay . meantime damons character deeper than ever , he falls abused woman whose redneck husband soon find out . read novel , then watch movie . it really very moving story characters book movie alive thriving . danny devito plays damons partner film it one better roles i've seen him play .	1
i won't say much , except when you see this item listed used section , snatch it ! worth it weight wheelbarrowed shrimp	1
but i'm cheerleader ~ natasha lyonne good movie could so much better . natasha lyonne perfect role megan . megan cheerleader , boyfriend but she not like kiss him , girls her locker thinks girls all time . her " friends " family decide it time intervention send her away camp turn her straight . music pretty awful most lyrics seem written five minutes or high school rock band . i truly music prevents me giving this movie 5 out 5 . script well written well developed characters plot truly outstanding . dialog hoot there many witty good one liners . this one good movie could easily attained 5 stars right soundtrack but it i give it 4 out 5 stars .	1

this serious documentary beat / hippie movement . it tons old footage interviews many most prominent beat figures like ginsberg , kerouac , burroughs , corso , ferlinghetti etc etc . it historical footage events like democratic national convention ' 68 be-in san francisco ' 67 . this perfect movie someone who loves beats or someone who never heard them . i didn't know much them when i first watched this documentary pbs , but after watching it i immediately became interested their movement . i started reading lot major works like road , naked lunch , howl turned into major fan . this movie exceptionally well-made presented . it some hollywood stars like johnny depp , but they only reading works beat authors , not major role . this just great documentary which contains valuable information interviews major beat characters who since passed away . this must any fan beats , hippies , yippies , drugs , american literary movements , counterculture , or just good documentaries general . i absolutely love it watched it several times	1

fellinis roma director fanciful excursion into auto-biographical self-indulgence magical higher level . filmed after his psychedelic " satyricon " , fellini extends his series dream-inspired visual classics . make no mistake , age 50 , fellini still it .

this surely one most seriously underrated mystery thrillers around , which shame since director sam raimi , just before hitting jackpot " spider-man " franchise , assembled wildly improbable cast inhabit admittedly lurid though constantly involving 2001 movie . i town southernmost tip chile when i first saw this movie hotel room which just happen hbo . not even outside splendor midnight sun could tear me away watching movie tv set back then . co-written billy bob thornton ( upon whose mother psychic gifts story based ) tom epperson , plot revolves around disappearance jessica starlet , daughter wealthy resident georgia backwater town . tired blind alleys , police begrudgingly recruit annie wilson , single mother three sons , who lost her husband factory accident now earn living tarot reading psychic/fortune teller . annie thinks she finds suspect donnie barksdale , abusive , white-trash husband one her most devoted customers , valerie . complicating matters annie her attraction wayne collins , her eldest son teacher jessica fiancee ; buddy cole , annie customers , suicidal mechanic traumatized parental abuse he received child . while it not perfectly constructed , sometimes excessive screenplay contains lot layers but remains true characters ' voices motivations throughout . raimi expert direction full sumptuous southern gothic visuals genuine tension escalates over course story . credit needs given jamie anderson cinematography neil spisak production design establishing such heady atmosphere perfect labyrinth plot . some actors really surprised me strong turns , including katie holmes spoiled , baby-faced debutante jessica ; greg kinnear seemingly stalwart wayne ; keanu reeves especially visceral chilling unrepentant wife-beater donnie ; giovanni ribisi deeply troubled buddy . smallish role valerie , hilary swank makes her moments count she cringes donnie scarifying dominance over her . but it wondrous cate blanchett who pulls it all together her multi-dimensional performance annie . convincing southern accent , she reveals hidden layers her character beautifully she tries recover loss her husband , protect her children make sense psychic revelations traumatize her us . dvd short extras - fifteen-minute featurette which includes cast crew interviews , movie trailer video neko case " furniture room lullaby " which perfectly reflects haunting soundtrack . definitely seek this one out if you looking atmospheric , character-driven thriller not condescend viewer	1

fresh horses , paper , would seemed perfect hit script . you molly ringwald , her porcelain skin delicately curly red-blonde hair . you andrew mccarthy his boyish charm but also male strength beginning come through . you romantic triangle . you " class divide " . brat pack loved millions . how could this fail ? problem really seem come down actors themselves . there very little " energy " all this story which supposedly passion overcoming logic . molly 16 yr old girl rural kentucky . when her stepfather begins fondling her , her mother little help , molly tries only escape she find - marrying older bad-man-in-town , viggo mortensen . she claims she never slept viggo - only used him escape . then viggo father began fondling her , now she wants out this house well . get momentary relief her homelife , she hangs out friend home , which 24 hour party . here she runs into andrew . andrew very serious student who just gotten engaged his high-class , wealthy girlfriend . girlfriend rambles china patterns , children living perfect life . andrew goes flow until he sees molly - instantly lust . molly leads him believe she 20 , single , interested him . it takes maybe 3 days before he sleeping her . his credit , he tell his fiancee promptly , breaks off engagement . you'd think everything wonderful now , right ? however , andrew learns friends molly lies . he decides keep seeing her anyway . however , he doesn't want introduce her his family , no intention marrying her . he says he loves her - but his feelings seem more related sex . one point he even gives her wad cash buy her off . there telling scene near end when andrew thinks molly publicly stripped her husband . andrew storms off their house talk viggo . andrew deliberately rude - laughing viggo artwork putting him down . but it viggo who calm one here . when molly shows up , viggo points out molly doing all this lying scheming so andrew would knight shining armor ride off her . he asks andrew - if you're saying i'm not good enough her - it seems you think you're too good her , right ? andrew finds himself agreeing - he won't take molly himself . he wants get molly away viggo , but then going abandon her her own means . how could he figure molly would better off nobody all , vs viggo ? fast forward year later , molly fact found herself " wealthy college boy " take care her taking classes again . she happy , andrew sad . i suppose you give them credit no t-t ypical hollywood ending story . landscapes often gorgeous , various details high class , low class , city , country all played nicely against each other . so problem really comes down main actors . molly andrew maybe gotten too used playing ensemble roles where each person just stereotype without lot depth . you really get sense shallowness when you're watching this movie . andrew entire life including long-term romance , he set . just 3 days he thrown it all away molly - but you never get any real sense he cares her . molly supposedly taking some quite desperate steps find safety her life - including seducing lying andrew order convince him rescue her - but she never seems care much either . intriguingly , only 2 people really seem depth this movie . one ben stiller , andrew best friend . it ironic because ben character shallow cares more himself than those around him . even so , ben really seems authentic someone who isn't used worry others - but who really try his best , many times , get andrew wake up reality . other viggo mortensen . you only glimpse viggo once until end movie - he just referred " rough guy " who many bad things . when you actually encounter viggo ( after andrew essence broken into his house confront him ) you're prepared worst . however , viggo very patient , very well spoken , quite intelligent his commentary . he doesn't thrash andrew sleeping his wife . instead , he lays out situation makes both andrew molly face their failings . molly deliberately lied used andrew tool getting better life . andrew , his part , knew he'd never actually rescue molly but led her repeatedly time her . some said this worst movie ever . many sections it very painful watch . however , i find glimmers meaning - especially ending discussion viggo . even there , though , you would think this would moment great soul searching andrew molly . instead , both seem think , " yeah , i guess that true . oh well , see ya . " i don't mind gloomy movies all - fact i really appreciate them sometimes . however , if movie no depth character or quality acting , it just makes whole experience fall flat .	1

... most original screenplay since citizen kane . least that my take . how i describe this movie ? i can't . it bizarre extreme , but i mean good way . it like nothing you've ever seen before . it takes screenwriting new level . maybe sounds tad pretentious , but sorry , it true . i can't imagine how they sold it . suits , i mean . i can't even imagine how script reads , how one make sense it paper . but i'm glad someone , because result stunningly-original film . but how i describe it ? i can't . i'm not only one this problem . i read back box video store : it made no sense . i read some capsule summaries internet movie database : they made no sense either . it very stream-of-conscious , proceeds more gut instinct than logic . basically , but not entirely , i [ heart ] huckabees philosophical discourse where various existential elements personified characterized . these existential elements get into arguments each other . if you're type person who thinks matters importance through only your own brain argue itself , hear little voices competing your psyche attention , then you'll understand this movie . if you aren't type person , you may find yourself , like many ( roger ebert , james berardinelli ) feeling outside , frustrated you can't crack code get " into " this movie . first frame i no trouble identifyinjg these extremely strange situations . but many , it understandable . i'll skip all obvious jokes how maybe right drugs help . this movie like drug . you may bad reaction it . or not . but how i describe it ? i can't . just rent it . performances joy , except maybe oddly dustin hoffman , who never really seems find unique voice match his unique haircut . paired lily tomlin , she blows him off screen seemingly without trying . jason schwartzman mark wahlberg wonderful screwball main protagonists -- schwartzman particular shines this sort offbeat role . isabelle huppert made me laugh just her what-is-she-doing-here presence , but i couldn't tell you why . ditto naomi watts . you read all reviews you want this film , but they won't it justice . you'll either hate it or it blow your mind . ebert didn't like it , but he didn't like brazil either , many same reasons . him , neither film " made sense . " me , they come deep within our psyches , owe more irrational than anything neocortex . how well you respond either might determined your imagination , how far it go , how many different ways you see something . but how i describe it ? i can't . go see it .	1

i knew akira kurosawa " kagemusha " ( 1980 ) some basis history , but i didn't know how much until i listened this dvd audio commentary film scholar stephen prince ( " warrior camera : cinema akira kurosawa " ) . according prince , virtually entirety film story based historical events -- major exception character thief who acts double shingen , warlord . however , shingen , historical figure , employed doubles real life , so kurosawa fictionalizing title character isn't much embellishment . what makes prince commentary so outstanding his in-depth knowledge japanese history . historical events chronicled film well-known japanese audience , but they're unfamiliar average western viewer . so , kurosawa often unconventional depiction these events frequently lost non-japanese audiences . example , according prince , wounding gunfire shingen he listens enemy flute marks monumental event japanese history . but kurosawa portrays event only oblique manner : sniper who shot shingen re-enact shooting ieyasu tokugawa ( historical figure , eventual winner wars kurosawa depicts ) . just imagine film abraham lincoln dramatizes his assassination it re-created secret service agents , you'll get idea kurosawa inventiveness . prince discusses some off-screen historical events going same time incidents film , giving listener much broader understanding both history kurosawa accomplishment . also , prince talks depth some artistic license kurosawa taken non-fictional events . after listening commentary , i came away much deeper appreciation " kagemusha . " since so much already said film itself , i only add this : it unfortunate shintar� katsu , who originally cast title role best-known starring zatoichi film series , fired kurosawa before filming began earnest . tatsuya nakadai , who replaced katsu , superb actor , but his screen presence doesn't comic warmth katsu could brought role -- i think would enhanced film . ( risk infuriating nakadai fans everywhere , i would also prefer seen his lead role kurosawa " ran " played toshir� mifune . ) i can't watch " kagemusha " without wondering how film might looked if kurosawa katsu hadn't quarreled . otherwise , " kagemusha " among kurosawa best period films . even if you already own " kagemusha " tape , this criterion dvd might worth renting prince commentary alone . ( disclaimer : i not know stephen prince personally , nor i any vested interest his work . )	1
this great movie plenty twists turns . only thing i think should creation sequel it could still now , especially now . ending leaves you wondering sliver doubt that why sequel should made . this one robert redoford better movies fayle dunway remarkable job . max von sydow cold calculating . rest cast blend naturally . i've seen this movie so many times but plot so real chances probability well . director excellent job directing actors . i recommend this movie after growing up working drive-in theatre i seen my share	1
i cannot get thru this one . i started fast-forwarding but there didn't appear any good spots . when i saw christian cammpbell this , i thought , this good . i just finished movie where he starred . can't remember name it . i guess person should never buy movie because who stars it . tori spelling well known , but not me . someone should put her out her misery right start . she not play flake very well , i don't know what call her except flake . i stopped this dvd first 1/2 hour go back give it shot , but tori spelling one leads , i already know this one not prayer . i would say ; save your money this one unless you under 13 . i ton straight gay movies tell story couple or few don't . this one falls into this category . one came this one " broken hearts club " while not my cup tea it far superior this piece garbage .	-1

critics lambasted kirk douglas ' performance " hammy " . i don't see all . this , without doubt , vincent van gogh we read " letters theo " miraculously brought life . van gogh actual life , whole thing kind creaking bipolarity it ; he periods creative bliss , happiness fulfillment , but they too short his almost unbearable intensity gets him into trouble too often too many people who help him . anthony quinn paul gaughan would seem like strange fit , but he pulls it off pretty well ; you feel arguments crashing them like thunderstorms , vincent unwavering belief their friendship so innocent enthusiastic one cannot help but feel heartbroken when it ends so terribly . douglas communicates vividly what we suspect van gogh reading his correspondences , his paintings ; he far too visionary ever really make it practical world , or overcome his restlessness long enough allow his art mature . beginning film more than any other sequence shows how violently alienated van gogh coteries social mores . his doomed-from-the-start mission minister ends ironically -- he too christian christians . while there explosion underground poverty-stricken children die very miner who introduced him their real hellish existence , he reprimanded his spiritual " superiors " dressing incorrectly . van gogh so enraged this he screams just what he thinks them , loses all chance path life . throughout film he remains christian , but he too much self-absorbed passionate artist always retain his ethics . douglas ' van gogh stick no situation or person very long : only constant thread his life his passion painting . sometimes performance so good we feel van gogh landmine madness coarsing through screen even empathize those who reject him because fiery nature could really scary times . we get chance see van gogh paintings way we never before , which probably best part this movie . his relationship his long suffering brother theo , played superbly james donald . he should gotten nomination best supporting actor , not anthony quinn , who turns roughly same performance every movie happened get lucky this one . somewhere inside him he knows his brother genius , but he still flesh blood van gogh deal financially otherwise . ending could not remotely powerful it without him . this film , despite concerning man titanic imagination , also good realistic attack myth tortured artist something romantic envied . barring his moments vision , van gogh life hell sorts led him miserable death . this nothing envy or emulate this movie communicates . still , beautifully must see anyone who wants understand one greatest painters ever live .	1

logan run belongs class old school science fiction films which popular early mid-1970 , prior beginning star wars franchise . these films not rely non-stop action or dazzling special effects , but rather thoughtful , intelligent stories , intriguing " what if ? " scenarios , astute social commentary . they included sci fi classics such soylent green , omega man , andromeda strain , westworld , others . while shopping mall setting some special effects logan run pretty cheesy , it still interesting film its themes may even more relevant today botox era than they 70 . i heard they doing remake would like think it improve original . unfortunately , given recent history hollywood , it more likely they drain every last bit intelligence out story , replace it more explosions , perhaps smith .	1

true ... this not quot ; bestquot ; documentary film ever made , although it pretty darned good , part criticism may come because most us who would want see this would just happy just one long uncut take concert film ... but we cd ( thank goodness ! ) . what concert it !!! this near dream cast one could hope . course there endless quibbling over opinion , endless comparisons obc ... that glory theatre ... many opinions . but overall arc energy this concert amazing cannot disputed ... cd classic ... one those rare few quot ; i wish i therequot ; events captured recording . said , documentary offer delight backstage glimpses it gives , especiallly after several ( hundred ? thousand ? ) listenings cd . instance ... i went into this already worshipping adoring barbara cook ( me there no other sally durant ) , but after watching , i really hooked onto lee remick too . there lots discovery moments like because documentary ... so it indeed , bring me someplace concert cd alone not , i truly value this dvd . so , perfect ? no . ( franky , what ? ) but it worth watching re-watching , especially if you total follies junky , or learning become one . how many other backstage stories you say ? me , darned few ... this one keeper . highly recommended	1
ignore all those harry potter nerds who say it wasn't like book , i mean who cares if it wasn't exactly same book film still turned out good great follow up series . missing scene involved house elf book but it not important , its great seeing all characters grow up onscreen they grow older films become more serious but still fun watch . this film concentrates more tri-wizard tournement harry tries prove hes most qualified experienced wizard even though senior wizards giving him hard time , you also get see harry , ron harmione prepare ballroom dance so there alot humor it well some dark scenes when voldemort played ralph fiennes finaly makes appearence ( person not something else ) confrontation harry potter . overall i would say this film great but not my favorite i still prefer prisoner azkaban	1

ever since i saw " fahrenheit 9/11 " ( which i thought ferociously hilarious ) , i trying check out michael moore earlier work ( both books films ) . i finally got around see " big one " this weekend . i felt like i could really relate michael disdain corporate america spent time working major corporation myself . i could relate employees various corporations who continually gotten screwed over corporate machine . i think it hilarious how random house tried reign michael shenanigans during his book tour their escorts . while there lots hilarious moments when michael tries confront various company ceos why they laying off their employees when they making good amount cash , there also good mix drama . one my favorite moments film when michael went capital wisconsin talk then governor tommy thompson his welfare reform policies two women who living below poverty level . apparently new welfare reform policy tommy signed when he governor doesn't work everyone . i love politician michael women confront state capital equivalent snake oil salesman , no one buying his schpiel because those women went through process new welfare reform they still living below poverty . one most personal touching moments when michael book signing borders ' bookstore one people line woman who recently laid off ford co .. i moved michael concern woman . i also liked his conversations other people like diners iowa ( i think ) just getting their overall opinions presidential election ' 92 . like his other films , " big one " mixes biting satirical humor real-life drama . michael moore movies me like mtv show " punk'd " socio-political message without talent-challenged ashton kutcher	1

one best documentries its genre ; " paradise lost " willkeep you rivited till end . then it not over - cause you start thinking what you seen wonder what fact really happened . i know loads people firmly believe innocence wm3 , i wholeheartedly support retrail . but , never i wished more something like " time machine " - so one go back history this incident see what truth ; see what really took place there . we must guard against notion wm3 without any blame , keep mind they troubled backgrounds . i firmly believe someone like damien dabble various cults unsavoury influences , i thought it mistake try deny outright . instance , i don't believe one moment rebellious teenager would change his name damien honour some priest who lived amongst lepers . just doesnt ring true . maybe their undoing - try paint them misunderstood ( totally ) spotless youngsters . but please , i am not implying they guilty . not least . you watch paradise lost 2 , once you seen this one , it compelling follow-up this tragic story	1

this become one my favorite movies late . i always love it ? not sure , but now its sort film i watch watch again . many other reviewers noted much interest film intellectual , fact comedy , however sophmoric one perspective , depends upon intelectual underpinning probably not shared most viewers . i agree . trust me , there much more than surface farce going here . i would note many other reviewers seem over focused existentialism philosophical school . i think this taking notion " existential detective " too narrowly . fact , greatest philosophical influence film seems me buddhism , which director long involvement . i once recommended film fellow teacher textbook intro zen . on-going tension affirmative vision totality nihilistic vision captures zen motif , " sudden enlgihtenment " balloon scene . i could go one great detail . nor i think film simply making fun intellectuals or philosophical seekers ; it far more subtle than . suffice it say me film powerfully moving , even uplifting , same time it acknowledges " manure human existance " . i doubt real difference those who " get it " those who hate it intellectual per se ( number " students philosophy " posting here hated film ) . its more matter one sense life , one attitude towards it : passion depths , complex thought , same time joy simple , including simple truth one own limitations . not film those too serious see their own absurdity , nor those uninterested taking time look beyond absurd serious	1

this movie gave us brat pack , staple certain 80s cultural set . term brat pack derived article writen journalist out one night most men starring st. elmo fire boozy night partying . since then gals movie well few others who weren't movie ( anthony michael hall , example ) suffered bit ripple effect . here we see all them their prime their peak heart throb success every teenage girl bedroom wall . out all dramedies john hughes movies , this one i liked least . maybe it fact all characters so vain self centered . maybe it fact it all so idealized seeing all them trying adjust their lives after graduating college . it trying next generation " graduate " movie , i didn't relate when my time came . maybe it fact i let down many people didn't network friends similar situations , isolation i felt during first year adjusting outside world left nest academia . i guess i just little more bitter . plus , my life surrounded work little else , i didn't all dramas going they . kind sad , one scene where rob lowe goes back his old frat house they tell him they need someone like him couch their team . it proves you really can't go home again there some clinging past . not mention embarrassing one gal who managed hold onto her virginity so long one attempts releive her it rob lowe finds those enormous granny panties . this caputed more time fashion music than it mindset . it not bad story , but vain self centered antics main characters left me cold .	1

although it might seem like odd starting point , first time i heard kurosawa rashomon when i read iris chang rape nanking first time few years ago . within this book she alluded film because various stories detailing atrocities committed nanking differed greatly depending source information . anyway , couple years after i read akutagawa ryuunosuke short story " rashomon " noticed it really not fit chang brief description movie it not until i read later short story collection , " grove " , i find actual short story film based . film rashomon western film audiences ' first real exposure films kurosawa akira it ignited flame interest kurosawa films decades come . good reason , because rashomon truly excellent film it still tops best films ever made lists constantly . during terrible rainfall three men , priest , woodcutter , bandit , duck into ruins rashomon gate escape massive downpour . priest woodcutter just returned court case detailing murder samurai bandit tajomaru . listening tajomaru testimony it seems like pretty cut dry case . he wanted samurai wife his own after raping her he killed her husband she asked him . however , after listening wife story even dead husband story through medium , it hard say what truth ... isthe old saying goes " history written victors " rashomon definitely displays not only how different people view same events , but how lies thread their way into truth corrupt it . kurosawa depicts scene samurai , his wife , bandit tajomaru four times within film 88 minutes , resulting juxtaposition quite enjoyable .	1
it long time since american gigolo , but richard gere remains quite ladies man . yes , this movie complicated relationsships , but concept exceptionally well executed . scenery pacific northwest just gorgeous dramatic moods camera perspectives . i thought while richard gere phenomenal primal fear , red corner jackal , this movie , intersection , makes him shine brings out lot his superb acting qualities all kinds emotions . it probably because this movie doesn't typical blueprint hollywood ending , this flick overlooked so far never received any significant recognition , but ending definitely surprise . there number interesting twists throughout film like i said before , director really captured various moods even created expressed right kind emotions . although movie overall sad undertone it it shows midlife crisis architect eastman ( . gere ) , it just one these rare motion picture masterpieces which you want watch least few times every year . it excellent picture	1

highly recommended example how stage sequence complex scene . if you like black comedy , you should enjoy " confessions american girl " . rena ( jena malone ) embodiment old cartoon where guy sitting ground noose around his neck broken rope his hand ; captioned " some people can't anything right " . rena lives mobile home her somewhat " strange " family , suicide challenged , pregnant guy who doesn't want seen public her , blames it all unfair eight year absence her loving father , who prison murder . her dim idealic memories her father somewhat biased . highway its exit ramps metaphors her life her desire end her life . film not quite good " ghost world " but much same tone feel . alicia witt plays rena half-sister . because malone witt arguably most intelligent actresses hollywood , you immediately wonder wisdom casting them moronic trailer trash . but malone special talent playing this kind " slack-jawed " character witt standard sarcastic teen character works fine even this environment . their scenes together best ones film ; their reconciliation scene toward end especially good . brad renfro good job rena brother , o-lon jones ( remember waitress seinfeld " bubble boy " episode ) excellent small role clifton collins jr. great buddy , prison trustee , who quickly sizes up situation sets forces change motion . while " american girl " above average film , its main scene ( picnic prison which actually takes up majority film ) pushes it into cinema classic territory . this scene example way storytelling should , pacing absolutely inspired . it staged perfectly buddy orchestrates sequence revelations changes all four visiting family members . even if you hate subject this film it worth watching just see how wonderfully they manage this climatic scene . disasterous visit over , family leaves prison statement " it went better than it could " . then again , what i know ? i'm only child .	1

regarding review , below , written " crazysunseteacher " , this complete tv series dvd set nothing all like two theatrical film releases . it contains full , uncut original television episodes , they originally broadcast " disneyland " 1950s . these five tv programs included considerably more footage than theatrical film releases . theatrical film releases available previously vhs ( now dvd ) anyone who bothered watch them compare them tv series dvd set would know immediately there considerable additional footage tv series , released this grand dvd set . there even different musical cues " ballad davy crockett " film version specially written accompany new film transitions . starters , very beginning film version omits scene crockett cabin his family . how could you miss if you watched two versions all ? reviewer question clearly not bother watch compare carefully two versions before posting review . please not let this uninformed , inaccurate review dissuade you buying this dvd set .	1

therese , lux , mary , bonnie cecilia make up five lisbon girls , ages 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 17 . cecilia , youngest , lives her sisters shadows because they all older much more interest their male neighbors . cry help , she slits her wrists lays down bathtub , she survived incident . after psychiatrist highly impresses upon strict mr. mrs. lisbon it would benificial cecilia exposed environments which boys her own age , mr. mrs. lisbon decide allow girls throw one only lisbon party . some neighborhood boys invited over while party session , cecilia pretty inanimate , sitting couch while her sisters flirt , talk laugh . midway through party , cecilia asks excused mrs. lisbon - though somewhat reluctantly - allows it . cecilia goes up her room ( second floor two-story house ) jumps out window , landing spiked fence front lawn lisbon house . this way , cecilia lisbon commited suicide . only four girls remain . act which cecilia committed not go all unnoticed . father saw her immediately , party ended there all boys went home rather glum . four lisbon neighbors , four young boys , suffered rapidly growing obsession lisbon girls , who beautiful total mystery outside world . they got hold cecilia diary tried explain why she committed suicide . eldest decided cecilia dreamer , she not think she would fall when she jumped out her window , she thought she would fly . their youngest sister gone , remaining lisbon girls grow closer each other , stranding themselves further outside world . when school starts again , they attempt go acting if nothing happened , not ever mentioning their youngest sister . run-of-the-mill awkward act taken part rest school however . usual profuse apology mention word " death " like . trip fontaine most popular guy school , object desire all girls school ... except lisbon girls , which no importance trip until he sets eyes lux . trip cannot help but enchanted her flawless beauty . beginning , he unsuccessful his quest even catch her attention she bluntly shows she not interested . but after his consistent courtship , lux falls his charming ways . trip then attempts convince mr. lisbon let him three his football team pals take lisbon daughters homecoming . after mr. lisbon talks his wife , he agrees trip request , knowing nothing but trip sincerity claimed honorable intentions , understanding trip all lisbon girls returned house curfew . after trip explains situation his football peers , he gives those who bribe him most handsomely . meanwhile , lisbon girls picking out fabric dresses they shall wear homecoming dance . though one pattern used all four dresses , each dress looks unique when concentrating detail . once they pick up girls , they stop midway homecoming order smoke , lux only girl volunteering smoke . they then drive dance . trip lux sneak away sneak swallows alcohol . one lisbon sisters her date follow , but leave soon afterwards , not wild nor daring trip lux . time they all decided meet back car so they could make girls curfew , they all there ... except trip lux , who time alone middle football stadium field . deciding they must make their own curfews , therese , bonnie , mary their dates leave without them . after fooling around , intoxicated trip lux fall asleep middle football stadium . trip awakens middle night leaves lux there alone . when lux wakes up early next morning she confused why trip not there . she takes taxi home her parents worried sick ( course ) . but they take measures far pulling girls out school stranding them inside lisbon residence . girls , desperate attempt hold onto connection outside world , begin using morse code interact four boys who so closely follow their lives . one which boys lived across street rest which came over daily after this order contact girls . soon following , boys begin talking lisbon girls via phone . one day , girls invite boys come over once mr. mrs. lisbon asleep . plan boys drive girls somewhere , boys hastily agree . they sneak over lux invites them wait inside her sisters lux goes wait car . boys wander down basement while waiting therese , bonnie mary , verbally expressing their hopes night . but then they realize they stumbled upon one sisters . she hung herself . boys , scared death , run all way home . time passed , things changed , girls came went ... but no matter what , those four boys never forgot lisbon suicides . ultimately , movie nothing short queer . when trying sum up story few lines ( such " follow lives lisbon sisters how they connect their neighbors . story full obsession , gossip , lust , love , desire isolation . " ) story sounds quite unique intriguing , but story fell short me personally . partly because lisbon sisters really committed suicide reason not much deeper than isolation . movie , places , also extremely flawed . i not believe mr. mrs. lisbon could've removed their daughters school so long without their daughters taken them social services . many parts movie , they should've used upbeat music fill deafening silences . whole movie filmed style i truthfully say makes me rather bored . i would only suggest this film , perhaps , people who like movies such " elizabethtown " which kirsten dunst also . but i personally disliked this movie which not very tasteful not watching it again future	1

i found this inspiring , thoughtful , extremely interesting take new paradigm science , quantum mechanics . this movie explains non-technical terms philosophical ramifications theory ( almost universally accepted ) how it relevant our everyday lives -- even non-physicists . it interviews many well credentialed credible physicists , philosophers , theologians , making it engaging even most cynical viewers . interspersed drama showing theories action regular person . me , it helps reconcile spirituality ( christian my case ) scientific theory whereas before i always felt my love science reason constant conflict my spiritual beliefs . no longer ! watch movie , which most part not dogmatic not judgmental but instead eye-opening logically satisfying even " religious .

utterly fascinating look crash burn american family . father , arnie friedman , witness his mother inappropriate self-serving sexual activity ; unsurprisingly , he turns out pedophile whose penchant buying kiddie mags gets him investigaged child rape . his wife , elaine , who looks like years arnie sucked life out her , walks around fog , totally bewildered a)she married such creepy little freak b)her three boys prefers dad her . oldest son dave his own state denial his father problems blames it all mom . most sympathetic figure youngest boy jesse , who imprisoned 13 years most unsympathetic crime . arnie jesse rape those little boys ? interviewed accuser comes across less than credible - he contradicts himself , can't remember first episode molestation ( though remembers plenty else ) when asked explain important detail , hesitates though he thinking " what heck i say now ? " feds appear caught up same hysteria got bunch innocent day care providers tossed prison 1980s - they used interview techniques more like criminal interrogations hypnosis ( reknown inducing false memories . ) way manipulate damage little kids , you dumb cops . any case , arnie self-admitted pedophile his taste child porn victimizes his whole family , especially jesse ( possibly more ways than one . ) despite this , his boys absolutely adore him . it hard understand why - their home movies , dad comes across emotional dud , flat affect distant stare . most animated he gets when he pounds out " i'm heaven " piano night before he goes prison . oldest son david especially apologist arnie . he implies if elaine not such cold fish arnie wouldn't predicament he ended up . you just want slap dave around facts life : " david ! wake up ! your parents didn't sex because daddy likes little boys !

teenager once , i certainly understand inner turmoil angst teens experience . however , pump up volume , movie attempt martyrize teens make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves underscore why so many adults look disdain teens . teens this movie seem little respect authority their assignation tortured misunderstood vanquished their juvenile behavior . even our hero ( well played christian slater ) cannot communicate people one one level ; he instead decides become some kind salvation his teens using his pirated radio shows cause some kind uprising among them . proponent truth , he vapid antithesis truth : he fakes masturbation arouse youths ; he doesn't use his real name or voice ; call potential suicide victim , he treats caller someone who isn't serious never really offers any kind consolation . suicidal teen says he lonely we automatically assume he lonely within his familial structure , but isn't he just lonely peers who mourn him after his demise ? adults played almost caricatures teens misunderstood heroes . sorry , folks , there ... living any age requires commitment better yourself what you feel right . questioning authority without any viable alternatives , none these teens , merely escalates generational gap , movies like this merely attempts exploit so called misunderstanding youth	1

this got worst film i've ever seen . its not sad . its not funny , jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage . i don't any sympathy toward nick this movie , because he give you anything work or want keep him . actor worst all . i cant tell if he sad some seens , or angry or jest retarded . i've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks , i guess its aimed different time homosexuals instead present . it probably worked better back 96 ' . but this movie so so so bad . its embarrassing . not rent it or buy it or view it television . note's: this film some great talenta song olivia newton jon , ( one my most personal favorites ) mila my favorite comedians margaret cho . she good but ... why this film , she ( mila ) good some want tearjerker movie like this .	-1
when you see lion king unavoidably 70th time like i , you grow really sick it . music storyline , it all breeds contempt . but movie itself shouldn't punished its overexposure . it good story , even though it similar hamlet . it good movie . i won't venture say it best cartoon ever because there still other movies like cinderellla snow white existence ; but it definitely one bes t.t he only picky issue i voices . they strong commanding voice james earl jones father , which right point ; yet they matthew broderick voice son . he sounds like he hasn't yet reached puberty even though he grown . other than this , film excellent	1
given pornography multi-jillion-dollar-a-year business , it sort surprising it hasn't received cinematic treatment more often , but boogie nights provides it sort skewed , darkly comic treatment it almost certainly deserves , becomes certifiable classic process . following story eddie adams , simple-minded , almost impossibly well-endowed teenager suburban california who achieves porn stardom dirk diggler before turning 20 , boogie nights both time-tested star-is-born-and-almost-blows-it-all story loving tribute time place probably never replicated individuals who made it what it . paul thomas anderson directing excessive stylish you'd expect movie centered porno industry , anderson pulling out every trick book -- long tracking shots , underwater closeups , montages , movie-within-a-movie views , some moments approach stream-of-consciousness ( dirk vision his professional name literally exploding off neon sign prominent example ) . naturally , anderson also loads movie up period details , right down farah fawcett poster teenage dirk room , platform shoes , obligatory disco sequences . its visual flair aside , though , boogie nights also sort insanely quotable , watch-it-until-you've-memorized-it movie seemed come out droves nineties ( trainspotting , fargo , goodfellas , swingers , true romance , etc . etc . etc . ) but disturbingly short supply this decade . this movie simply seems everything you think going it , especially its murderer row cast -- burt reynolds ( jack horner ) , don cheadle ( buck swope ) , john . reilly ( reed rothchild ) , julianne moore ( amber waves ) , william . macy ( little bill ) , luis guzman ( maurice rodriguez ) , tom jane ( todd parker ) , philip baker hall ( floyd gondolli ) , philip seymour hoffman ( scotty jay ) , alfred molina ( rahad jackson ) all figure prominently -- even wahlberg ( dirk himself ) heather graham ( rollergirl ) roles perfectly suited their relative limitations actors . said , what really gives movie its resonance obvious sympathy which it treats its characters , who generally easy laugh but equally easy like . main characters almost entirely hopes , aspirations , attachments beyond rather closed world their profession--jack desire serious filmmaker ; dirk ridiculous pseudo-karate reed equally ridiculous poetry ; buck goal opening his own stereo store ; amber attempts get back touch her son , which she blatantly compensates mothering her co-stars -- helping us see them fleshed-out characters , not just plot devices story . since there isn't really plot speak , movie told series episodes , goodfellas-style , several extended pieces -- pool party jack house where eddie/dirk gets introduced whole crew ; new year eve party celebrating start ' 80's; fake drug deal gone bad rahad house -- serving turn narrative new directions . this last set piece -- when dirk , reed , todd head over rahad house sell him some baking soda disguised cocaine it quickly degenerates into laughably misguided robbery attempt -- deserves special mention , it easily one most fascinating single scenes recent film memory . it starts off almost surreal , skinny chinese guy walking around randomly lighting firecrackers rahad ( clad only underwear , bathrobe slippers ) discoursing semi-coherently he sings not-so-classic 80 songs mixtape . there it just gets progressively darker tenser , lighting , acting , direction all perfectly serving ratchet up feeling desperation horror todd kicks his ill-conceived robbery plot into motion things spin way out control . molina over-the-top performance , more than anything else , makes scene , he turns rahad into manic ball drug-fuelled energy , later , shotgun-toting avenging angel determined take his revenge . i wouldn't say molina turns best performance i've ever seen movie , but it it probably best performance i've seen someone who only got one scene whole movie . ' 80 , course , hangover joys previous decade , emergence video downgrades quality product , cocaine suddenly becomes addictive , dirk starts become too big his britches more ways than one . fittingly , disco era gives way tougher times eighties , movie takes darker turn , becoming grittier , more downcast lot more violent , but no less compelling . all unbridled energy creativity first half still present , just decidedly less sunny form . even when people getting beaten up shot left right , movie pedal-to-the-metal pacing makes it all but impossible look away . well , except maybe notorious money shot end , but then i one didn't care .	1

' they wait spring come plane discovered before they risk spending money , `simple plan ' begins unravel horrific consequences . thornton briscoe play country boys perfection , paxton great job small town golden boy seriously compromised . bridget fonda plays hank pregnant wife , who turns out brains ( it ) group . there some very nice plot twists all too human emotions characters begin crash into one . inevitably we morality tale which wages sin fully realized . sam raimi ( " evil dead " , " spiderman ) direction captures well atmosphere north country america without any obvious straining effect . he gets great mileage out few crows ( actually some them ravens , i think ) whole lot snow . scott . smith script ( his novel ) clever morally astute . characterizations excellent story psychologically satisfying . particularly agreeable very sad , ironic end hank his wife , who find all self-created hell they went through led them back where they began , but without their souls . dark message greed honesty topsy-turvey roller-coaster ride beautiful cinematography slick direction horror-master raimi . not one those who need cheering-up session .	1

samuel beckett play seems endlessly perplex reviewers : they want see it concrete associations it generally denies them . godot god ? didi gogo heroes their seemingly indefatiguable faith he arrive , or fools hinging all their hopes dreams man who never seems arrive help alleviate their suffering ? waiting godot , proper modernist fashion , strips away all layers narrative form leaves nothing but naked husk play , which beckett no doubt felt revealed human condition its most basic . but play power doesn't really come . rather , what makes waiting godot so compelling its wide applicability : it story random oppression , brutality , dreams deferred harsh realities . it performed allegory apartheid south african , jim crow south , horror war bosnia every other possible situation imaginable . why ? because benjamin kunkel pointed out piece new yorker not so long ago , " [ n]ot everyone god , but who doesn't godot ? " beyond metaphysical implications play , though , it popularity stems its near-perfection : all philosophical meaning people see it , action progresses virtually no direct reference it , every line which seems suggests some sort grand significance very concrete meaning action . take infamous opening : estragon , first tramps , struggles pull off his boot relieve his swollen foot . unable get it off , he gives up announces " nothing . " vladimir , wincingly wandering onto stage grasping his crotch ( precious few readers actors matter seem grasp one play running jokes vladimir venereal disease , which causes him immense pain when urinating ) , thinks estragon commenting his own ailment , announces , " i'm beginning come round conclusion myself . all my life i've put it me , saying vladimir , reasonable , you haven't yet tried everything ! i resumed struggle . " one hand , lines relate concretely action play ; other , they become representative modern man ambivalence towards cruel uncaring world , such clever cynicism linked beckett french existentialists whose circles he moved after second world war . but seen merely declamatory statements world-weary cynicism , lines lose all their power ; beckett achievement comes his ability link such nihilistic sentiments extremely comic moments , it humor carries reader or theatergoer through what would otherwise unbearably cynical play . steve martin , who played vladimir famous 1982 production lincoln center new york , put it best when he said he sought serve humor play , because meaning could carry itself but humor could not . that lesson which , sadly , precious few theater directors seem grasp , but which careful reader discovers beckett . definitely must-read , but read it before seeing it , because few productions it justice	1
this episode star trek , " man trap " my earliest memory what would become lifelong enjoyment franchise . truthfully , " man trap " terrified me ( i maybe two , or three , although i am sure time series limping it third season i seeing repeat first time ); star trek considered " adult programming " , such i not allowed watch it - i used sneak behind couch while my grandfather watched it nights i stayed their house , then would lay awake my bed scared what i'd seen , but excited just same . like space show i enjoyed terrified ( lost space ) , i didn't recognize star trek anything but world i wanted very much , but remained frightened anyhow ( i , i said , very young ) .	1

restore it ? why ?! i like deathi like miseryi like this wooorrrrrrrlllllddd !!! this movie rocks !.. it some awesome fight scenes , really well . they may not overly skillful ( i don't even think van damme overly skillful martial artist unlike jet li , jackie chan or bruce lee ) but he ability make his fight scenes just " look " so damn cool ! there so many " cool " moments this filmeg . -van damme splits 2 walls waits one pirates walk under him , before killing him his kickass knife-van damme one pirates eye each other off distance factory .. then run full pelt each other screaming , then engage awesome knife fight ( cool use slow-mo too)-the first appearance van damme film basically just shot his leg out nowhere executing awesome roundhouse kick face bad guys ( soo cool)and so many more quality scenes	1

i saw this movie when i 25 years old , same age michael o'keefe , very good young actor . i agree reviewer his range emotions ... anger , love , compassion , superbly expressed . i think he should won best supporting oscar time , but instead academy gave it timothy hutton ordinary people ( fabulous young actor ) . robert duvall , course , brilliant always . i seen movie several times , each time it reminds me two struggles duvall : dominance over everyone around him , struggle masculinity father son ( duvall o'keefe ) . this struggle interesting study father who very proud but yet threatened , manly sensitiveness , athletic ability , spunk his own son . first indication this when they playing basketball together . o'keefe typical vigorous 17-year-old ( almost 18 ) , expertly dribbling shooting duvall into increased anger frustation . i think very quick whack duvall gave o'keefe butt o'keefe slightly bending over , very skillfully dribbling ball away duvall , first indication he his father .. boss . you don't embarrass boss beating him . i even thinking , because duvall such jerk -- please michael , let your father win ! next , terrible scene performed so well -- when duvall , furious o'keefe not relent giving him two point extension , stadiscally bobs ball o'keefe head , humiliating him calling him his favorite girl . o'keefe retaliates yelling " this girl whipped your ass good , colonel ! " . i thought duvall would start physically fighting his son smart , but retort so smart , it left duvall silent paralyzed . those two chemistry , truly great together . watch it , performances move you much story typical but challenged , military family	1

i just relived my teen years viewing this film yesterday let me say i see similarities bruce lee classic " enter dragon " now . yes , it " etd " clone but " etd " clones go , its pretty damn good stands its own ! other than kickboxer , lionheart perhaps first universal soldier , this easily jean claude van damme best performance ever ! like other reviewers , what kept me glued training montages seeing all those different styles fighting ! while some them overplayed sake film , many these styles exist real martial arts so it fun see them even if they exaggerated bit . while they didn't any dialog , i found other fighters engaging just what they kumate mat ! my favorite non-speaking character , still , real-life fighter paco ! my friends i loved him some reason ! bolo yeung guy most young adolecent boys dream . very little talk but all action ! his portrayal villian chong li wasn't acting masterpiece but it didn't need convey this one bad mutha ..... well you get idea ! while this based life frank dux , story exposed fake recent years . still , even knowledge , its still fun film watch though it toned down violence today standards . imagine if they re-made this film today !? level violence would probably off page ! van damme , who starred other low-budget action films before this ( most notably " no retreat , no surrender " ) , got his first starring role this film enjoyed good run 1987 until mid-90's! still , this one his brightest moments film ! enjoy martial arts action , 80 style !	1
most other reviews printed here i am agreement . there little i need add except i saw film first time eighties when it came out tape . i just rewatched it still find my gut reaction same then some . schlesinger work , three leads marvelous script make engrossing , sobering disturbing treatise how so many people lack values seek " happiness " all wrong places -- especially wrong people . after twenty-odd years first viewing this film , i realized tonight how strong julie christie performance this film . there not one hole this bravura performance . it odd make this statement , especially since she playing such shallow role . it not easy nor desirable part play , but she carries it off if she herself character . selfishness core character well immaturity , she stoops conquers . laurence harvey never played rogue better dirk bogarde perfect jilted lover who indeed possesses heart , but nevertheless gives ( but not completely ) ms. christie empty needs . he , indeed , sees through her throughout most film but cannot help swayed her charms . emptiness served up brilliantly . we must respect talents involved providing us lesson -- well thank them ( two levels least : talent coupled making us examine what should really value us )	1

' we live trenches we fight . we try not killed - that all!'the film totally committed its proposition war evil ; not only first world war which portrayed film , but all war . motion picture , considered among screen most powerful indictments futility war , contains many excellent sequences set-pieces which still keep their power : pair boots continually taken over successive owners killed ; lew ayres talking impotently brotherhood man futility killing he watches his french enemy die beside him shell crater ; ayres carrying wounded wolheim his back talking cheerfully him , ignoring he killed shell splinter ; course , closing scene hand reaching out trenches seize butterfly only fall back slowly enemy bullet falls home ... despite dated moments , this highly emotive war film retains its overall power remains great pacifist work ... film won won oscars best picture best director nominated best cinematography best writing ...	1

i'll try not add comments others already made . one thing i'll say it not horror flick many make film out . grow up ! yes there some scenes make you " shiver " but this not film just going around maiming animals characters like sm other reviews tend portray . maybe i grew up watching too many horror movies or else reading all these reviews gore violence built up my expectations what i encounter , or else i just watch too much daily news . whatever , reason , don't go watch film thinking it going all out horror show . it emotions conjured up through anger , betrayal , love . it hits sensitive areas relationships . put yourself into character place . how would you feel what would you ? ( maybe not fish hooks . ) far all peta comment , ( which i'm not member ) they cry foul over eating chicken ! worse stuff happens over here us . keep mind it different culture you're seeing film . vietnam other parts asia they eat dogs . other parts world may frown us eating chickens cows pigs . we don't " prepare " our animals . we just buy it packaged ready cook . gross stuff us . so called gross animal scenes fast camera doesn't " loom " animal so it inconsequential part scene . so what , they put it film . i've seen documentaries how steak pork chops prepared no one says it no-no show . frog incident-she knocked out skinned frog eat/feed guys bird . she didn't skin it first when it alive . it not like we don't eat meat over here . her economic status didn't allow her go local shaws market get one skinned trimmed . you see last year what people chickens raised i think kfc ? they stomping kicking them fun it . internet i saw clip kids putting live kitten cage , pour gas all over it then light poor thing fire . fish incidents- if you've ever prepared fish its no big deal . yes , it mean hack up fish ( guys pissed ) or run current through it ( lady pissed ) but it trying convey anger characters them . same lady slapping dog around . she didn't beat it death . she mad it didn't want go out boat boat house , plus she wasn't very happy . ( although it doesn't make it right . ) fresh sushi- can't get it any fresher than . if you watch movie , fish didn't die it caught male main character later , then set free , show his pity it . yes , fish hook scenes not pleasant watch but ) guy didn't swallow hooks far evidenced lady taking them out pair pliers , ) you dont see her inserting fish hooks into any place , just up her dress . there no clear shot what she . she bleed quite bit but wouldn't you if you ? i've seen much worse horror flicks news . anyway , there lots more this film than just gore animal mistreatment . go see movie blank slate you'll like it better . but ending little curious	1

i won't go into plot sypnosis , it detailed previous reviews film ; instead , i'd like address message meaning film . order fully appreciate au hasard balthazar one must understand thematic construction film . literally passive , dumb beast who passed owner owner mistreated shown ( little ) love throughout his life , bresson uses balthazar witness reflection -- or both window mirror , if you -- human nature all its facets . there also clear parallels bresson establishes balthazar his owners , especially his first owner , marie . purpose such thematical tool audience regard balthazar facet human condition , but only spiritual sense ( bresson takes extreme care not anthromorphologize donkey ) . so , balthazar these group characters , film shows entire spectrum humanity : purity ( balthazar ) , good ( jacques ) , evil ( g�rard ) , weakness ( arnold ) , selfishness ( merchant ) , arrogance ( marie father ) self-pity ( marie ) . one or several these characters , we see ourselves since they encapsulate different ways human beings deal their existence . now this most important thing comprehend film : balthazar ignorant , unknowing beast who no choice but accept everything happens him his life due his condition , donkey , creature who no intelligence who no free . he simply lives life way he knows : he used animal burden , he so . he mistreated his owners , he accepts mistreatment . he shown love compassion marie , he accepts it . he even shares his state other animals ( times captivity during his stay circus times freedom during his deathbed ) . if you think it , within oportunities ( or lack thereof ) he given , circumstances ( good bad ) he gone through , balthazar achieved live life fullest ( die utmost grace ) . us human beings different condition balthazar . human beings intelligence , reasoning free make choices . yet all those gifts advantages , humans no peace mind keep attitude towards life making choices more often than not , lead life misery suffering , destroying ourselves lives others process . simple yet profound question film basically begs us ask ourselves : " if balthazar could live life fullest , why can't we ? " . when we realize this reflection balthazar life reflect it our own , sudden feeling enlightenment , trascendence spirituality undeniably invades us . throughout this meaningful revelation , we emerge moral clarity ( especially concerning characters film ) newfound sense spirituality , hope strong transform ourselves . i personally can't think something more inspiring life-affirming than . au hasard balthazar very well might change your life . this one most noble , humane beautiful works art , any medium .	1

it becoming pretty clear me surrender cinema ahead game compared other purveyors erotic ( all right-soft porn ) movies . virtual encounters impressive effort . look sound movie excellent , way beyond your typical naughty movie . plot holds together , acting pretty good overall , players arena generally pretty attractive . amy ( elizabeth kaitan ) take-control kind woman who apparently somewhat reluctant shift into intimacy overdrive her boyfriend . he kindly gives her deluxe pass virtual encounters her birthday . there she meets disembodied , smooth-talking rob , who guides her through number virtual reality sessions designed help her discover her hidden desires activate wild gene lying dormant inside her too long . she starts slowly , simply observing , but eventually she becomes participant sexual escapades revealed her , taking number different forms ( including man ) course experience . plot works pretty well because moviemakers don't spend whole lot time worrying it , preferring simply jump one virtual reality session fairly quickly . things start slowing down little bit midway through film , but last few scenes pick up pace significantly . it goes without saying virtual encounters definitely adults only . this kind movie make erotic movie fan out anyone who sees it ; basically , there something here just everyone	1
great stuff fantasy fan . it made great tv show also	1
joe clay ( jack lemmon ) up-and-coming public relations agent era three-martini lunch " drinks boys " following workday . while providing client , literally , boatload girls , joe meets receptionist kirsten arnesen ( lee remick ) , good girl stable country upbringing . joe introduces kirsten alcohol form brandy alexander , before long two fall love marry . joe provides good living his wife new baby daughter , but becomes depressed quiet family life baby takes up all his wife attention . truly gut-wrenching scene , joe berates completely degrades kirsten not any fun anymore , throwing temper tantrum while drunk demanding she stop nursing her own baby ( mammary envy ) because its going ruin her shape . very poignant heart braking scene . kirsten deeply love joe , concedes his demands " loosen up little fun again " , which means couple drinks him . it isn't long before kirsten drinking all time , very common women early sixties , kirsten starts smoking ( probably help lose weight , though this isn't mentioned beyond joe comment her shape ) . joe career slides his drinking increases , causing him late work upsetting his clients . his company assigns him lower-level client far away houston . while joe tries his job there , kirsten sets their apartment fire drinking smoking . joe fired , not long afterward joe epiphany . he bum , his wife bum , they need stop drinking . kirsten father takes struggling couple into his home where he runs nursery . after couple months sober , joe kirsten fall off wagon together riotous binge their room . second very poignant incident follows where joe trashes his father-in-law nursery looking bottle he hid . this scene may seem overdone first , but just tune into one episode ' cops ' you see how well jack lemmon played this scene . this time , joe winds out hospital going through some overblown withdrawal symptoms , it here he meets jim hungerford ( jack klugman ) alcoholics anonymous . once aa , joe tries fight his disease , while kirsten remains absolute denial alcoholic . you must remember this movie made 1962 , there quite stigma attached alcoholic , 60 version scarlet letter . there no happily-ever-after this movie . though made 1962 , it still best ' alcoholic ' movies ever made . ' leaving las vegas ' certainly portrayed down-and-out alcoholic , but character ben modern portrayal wanted die . ' days wine roses ' story two people struggle against alcoholism , not their submission i t.t here nothing outdated this movie except fashion ; times change , behaviors don't . kirsten confession she " just wants things look prettier than they " rings so true addiction any form or any era . this movie people disease , not time-period , so it stands up any modern day addiction stories . ' days wine roses ' true classic , timeless piece both sad entertaining . take quick note fact joe kirsten first apartment , bar right outside baby room . i thought bit ironic . if you love addiction movies , modern pieces like ' leaving las vegas ' , ' requiem dream ' , ' spun ' , or ' fear loathing las vegas ' , you love ' days wine roses ' . enjoy !	1

truely speaking , this very hilarious episode . must see every one	1
this 1953 film , i believe third five collaborations director anthony mann jimmy stewart western genre it , perhaps , their best . filmed breathtaking color colorado rockies , cinematography , william mellor , flawless . mellor obviously one best his time , reponsible principle photography such other notabled movies such " giant , " " compulsion , " " bad day black rock , " even " peyton place . " naked spur generally recognized one best westerns all time , though , much debate reigns this subject . it not often viewer gets watch angry , unmerciful jimmy stewart bounty hunter hell-bent bringing outlaw robert ryan , " dead or alive , " not justice sake , but reap benefits $ 5,000 . 00 reward . way , accident , he inherits two diversely different partners whose ultimate fates not his concern least . this jimmy stewart we're not used seeing . his relentless determination throughout entire film palpable . again , mountainous somewhat snowy setting instrumental element film . i wondered where film titled derived . well , you won't find out until film climax set among rocky cliffs which border fast flowing river . all all , excellent film-going experience viewers all kinds but especially lovers western genre .	1
everyone , including amazon , this documentary imagine , which i don't believe it . this " video version " imagine album , each song it own video , includes couple yoko fly . it released 1986 , time , pretty cool , it digitally remastered really well lot then unreleased footage , mostly shot tittenhurst . time , technology releases john lennon : imagine gimme some truth rendered this pretty much obsolete . even excellent sound upped 2001 remaster album . but i still pull it out once while . it got few clips aren't either other videos besides , any self-respecting beatle fan should it	1

orwell novel taking spectacular ideas life o-o peration morphing it fit your own greedy desires , losing all purpose ultimately ending futile , corrupt dictatorship . it made fun dictators then still makes fun dictators today , though easy read it went deep speaking politically man actions against man . sadly , none this film . fact , this movie travesty original novel . one major problem it renders orwell novel cute , probably due release all animal films during this time ( " babe " , " gordy " , what you ) . old major speech great speech , who better perform it than peter ustinov ? unfortunately , this speech ruined talked over julia louise dreyfus horse complaining she lose her ribbons if man overthrown , among other animals their minor problems . imagine katie couric talking over winston churchill " we fight beaches " speech you'll understand how i feel . it gets worst later . main character not farm entire , but instead female dog annoyingly whines complains whole time tries narrate what going . this sound bad ? it gets worst . end she leads animals out farm , then tells us everything lived happily ever after . napoleon animalism fails ( we're never told how or see it happen , they basically throw it us say " take our word it ! " ) then white , middle-class family four moves takes over farm . end . orwell point just fly past these people or what ? orwell always master closing line me , " animal farm " no exception . even british animated film managed sneak orwell metaphor before closing happy ending . this such waste . peter ustinov old major , ian holm squeeler , patrick stewart napoleon ... all these talented names wasted sounds horrible , but it true . such great book serious representation treated amatuerish fashion may not bother some , but others it big deal . if you like orwell , if you loved novel , if you enjoy great stories , if you enjoy good films ... don't watch this movie	-1

cecil de mille greatest show earth won oscar best picture 1952 . while it may not greatest movie ever made , it certainly made me want see real live circus again , no small feat . stunts both funny fantastic , animals majestic , circus comraderie feels genuine , you practicallly smell cotton candy . yes , there plot here too . very young charlton heston circus manager who must ride herd everyone . betty hutton cornel wilde play trapeze artists ; jimmy stewart clown past . there romantic triangle well good guys triumphing over villains . almost everyone -- but not quite -- winds up happy end . you should certainly see -- if you never before -- this movie but don't take it too seriously . they say , they don't make movies like this anymore	1

even though i am not streisand fan , i astonished just how dopey annoying this movie . plot supposed revolve around big change appearance streisand character , making her attractive - no , irresistible - main male character . problem , she looks almost exactly same before after makeover ! somebody ( probably streisand ) thinks highlighted hair , tight black cocktail dress , baggy-lipped smirk irresistible whereas pink bridesmaid dress , casual clothes , everyday looks disgusting . baaaaaamp ! ( that fallacy alarm going off : men , my experience , don't care much clothes makeup . ) there lot emphasis placed streisand character losing weight riding exercise bike , but she looked exactly same afterward - no detectable weight difference ! yet truly , low point movie scene which streisand , discussing her baby early-childhood photos her mother ( played lauren bacall ) , blubbers , " wazz i pretty baby ? wazz i pretty babyyyyeeee ? " one scene , streisand neuroticism concerning her looks fully revealed . whole movie this issue , it amazing entire cast , crew , production company would devote themselves . . ' emotional issues like . i really think " funny girl " phenomenon somehow ruined streisand thought processes . media buzz her time she kind cute despite light-years away stereotyped , northern european beauty standard time ( think grace kelly ; think ingrid bergman ..... ) . i recall reading how her glowing complexion , thick hair , good figure ( well her energy voice ) carried her through despite her looks : long nose , large lips , slanted eyes . myself , i think she looks like egyptian princess or similar ; but she certainly doesn't look like grace kelly ..... so why can't she accept this ? majority us women , whatever our race , color , or bone-structure , learn live love who we ..... least i hope we ! this movie not . this movie says you certain dress hairdo desirable . maybe i should've given it only one star	1

this movie far anything great . some characters don't make any sense what so ever original cast . leatherface role mocked . people spend too much time focusing other people rather than build up leatherface . first tcm classic . second tcm great well . but leatherface : tcm iii , next generation , tcm remake all made texas chainsaw massacre franchise laughing stock . i really hate new directors coming into horror scene just mess it up . only thing they these days make crappy remakes fill horror movies up cgi . enough enough .	-1

former film student ardent lover medium this day , unbearable lightness remains one my all time favorite films . it intelligent , well-acted , tender , yet tackles serious thought-provoking internal external subjects such fidelity , authenticity , armed conflict personal freedom . more than anything it always , always great pleasure watch . characters so genuine well-rounded , although they tremendously diverse you care not one , not two , but all them . beautifully shot edited what appear real photos footage time which it set , i would recommend it anyone . it not aged day . i count one hand examples film adaptation where film really adds legacy piece , equals or even transcends power book . that saying lot this case because book also something experienced	1

i just didn't get it . movie painfully boring . only remotely redeeming aspect some interesting cinematography .	-1
i'm going assume book " i captured castle " better than movie . cinematography excellent , acting decent all around except lead character played romola garai . her most dramatic scene , confrontation her father , she played out her emotions over-slow , melodramatic manner like bad , bad stage play . i'll give her break because this one her first films , but thank goodness bill nighy carried rest scene . funny thing when you listen romola during her interview special features , you think " why couldn't we get this part you film " ? she intelligent witty woman , but her performance lead character just underwhelming . that horrible shame . lead always sets tone film . this would explain why movie seemed drag . i found this film bore despite wonderful talent .	1

20 years ago , there terrible accident mine valentine day . following year one miners , harry warden , takes terrible revange those responsible accident . since day , there no celebration valentine day little town valentine buff . until now ( 1981 ) . but harry warden seems returned stop celebration . music music quite good , but it doesn't lead film any direction , so it not helping . story recycled , which good , but could much more minimalistic . why not just party let miner kill kids ? trying put twist story " explaining " things seldom very helpful . murderar places human hearts valentine boxes which distasteful but not really scary . variation holiday theme , could bit more focused .	1
i love films which unfold complexities slowly , use color deep intention , don't rely words say everything must said . end affair lovingly carefully adapted film . fit into time , i feel you must allow film like this stand its own . many adjustments made story , what eventually emmerges , me , even more cohesive personal . one thing i particularly love end affair , color pallette sharp attention clothing . i love sarah red suits , her green jacket , her hair ( carefully suited time ) , way colors stand out , but subtlety , every scene she stands until her character begins fade . this movie permanently affected my aesthetic sensibilities . * most * affecting aspect movie me however , able deeply relate character sarah , i think many people . most us our superstitions , even when we work keep them subdued , certainly seemingly " miraculous experience , " or great trauma ( they usually go together don't they ? ) bring those things surface . i thought bendrix henry dynamic played out film fascinating . it created contrast two ways living really : one figure , content live straight line , climbing little little bits satisfaction but no passion , other all passion anger intensity . henry , way , created passion sarah felt maurice . he bottled her up placed her shelf where she simmered , i think " vulgar sex scenes " some called them , extraordinarily necessary if you want understand emotions going . then again , sarah religious devotion followed her commitment henry , which before vow she seemed no intention lessening , so you also see she more than sensual person she maurice , she also practical wife . neither role she playing . every central character this film , dichotomy , more than , they wonderfully spectacularly flawed , which certainly core graham greene insightful philosophic writing . this labrynth film , rich unanswerable questions , contains most brilliant use perspective i ever seen . if you , like me , like watch good film several times , i recommend listening neil jordan commentary least one viewing , then watching it again . -stephanie	1

this movie great actors , great screenplay , great director . i can't fully write how good this film why it considered classic . it won best picture oscar one few winners really deserve mention award-winning film . director made romance low-key , which makes sense considering cynical nature film . billy wilder ( director ) also knew when inject humor when inject drama . very few directors good sense when incorporate humor into dramatic moment . any other time it just distracts messes up flow picture but here wilder kept things smooth . i also love ending which my viewpoint perfect considering cynical mood set characters . this film little romance , mixed dash drama , hint comedy making delightful piece classic hollywood film	1
i first saw this film many many years ago ....... it wonderful i thought it ....... i love shakespeare poetry ..... it just beautiful listen . performances top-notch - leonard whiting olivia hussey absolutely gorgeous ! i think that what zeffirelli going - truly young beautiful people these immortal roles . they just so young gorgeous passionate - just what you need play romeo juliet . this particular disc no extras - merely theatrical trailer , but what i really wanted just see film again after quite some time passed ; extras not important me . it hews pretty closely shakespeare original text story . beautiful cinematography , wonderful costumes ..... i enjoyed it not disappointed	1

+++++ " intolerance jews fact 16th century life , even venice , most powerful liberal city state europe . law jews forced live old walled foundry or `geto ' area city . after sundown gate [ geto ] locked guarded christians . daytime any man leaving [ geto ] wear red hat mark him jew . jews forbidden own property . so they practiced usury , lending money [ ] interest . this against christian law . sophisticated venetians would turn blind eye it but religious fanatics , who hated jews , it matter ... " this how this wonderful movie begins above words printed on-screen so orient viewer . this movie based controversial troubling play " merchant venice " ( written circa 1596 ) william shakespeare ( 1564 1616 ) . main plot this play movie concentrates follows : sixteenth century venice , when christian merchant named antonio ( jeremy irons ) must default large loan jewish moneylender named shylock ( al pacino ) his friend bassanio ( joseph fiennes ) who romantic ambitions rich portia ( lynn collins ) belmont , vengeful shylock demands cruel substitute repayment antonio . movie proceeds we hear these famous words uttered shylock : " he [ antonio ] hath disgraced me ... laughed my losses , mocked my gains , scorned my nation , thwarted my bargains , cooled my friends , heated mine enemies , what his reasons ? i am jew . hath not jew eyes ? hath not jew hands , organs , dimensions , senses , affections , passions ?... if you prick us , we not bleed ? if you tickle us , we not laugh ? if you poison us , we not die ? " shylock continues : " if you wrong us , shall we not revenge ?... if jew wrong christian , what his humility ? revenge . if christian wrong jew , what should his sufferance christian example ? why , revenge ! " aware end movie , you may not know whether you've seen tragedy or comedy ( play officially classified comedy ) , love story or tale hate . its infinite ambiguity , movie play said quintessential shakespeare . also , aware movie entirely elizabethan language . if you not used this kind spoken language , i would strongly recommend you turn closed-captioning . ( dvd , unfortunately , not english subtitles . ) one final caution : there bare-breasted prostitutes appear briefly . they not put movie make it more risqu� but rather add some historical authenticity . venetian law time required all prostitutes bare their breasts because christian authorities concerned rampant homosexuality city . thus , this movie `r ' rating because this ( which i think ludicrous ) . acting this movie word -- fantastic . i surprised this but al pacino thoroughly convincing shylock , very complex role . i also give credit jeremy irons ralph fiennes who fine jobs their roles antonio bassanio respectively . cinematography excellent . movie filmed location venice , veneto ( region north italy ) , luxembourg . background music exquisite . i heard lute , harp , other instruments i'm not familiar . i learned later some music contributed baroque string quartet . ( baroque period art period circa 1600 1750 . ) background vocals mesmerizing . finally , dvd ( one released 2005 ) perfect picture sound quality . it few extras . bottom line : this movie worthy addition bard cinematic cannon . ( 2004 ; 2 hr , 10 min ; wide screen ; 28 scenes ; rated `r ' ) +++++	1
movie i liked critics hard . film great until you get closer ending . i thought ending bit lame " mutant " son not all believable . scary but not totally believable . despite some problems i ending creature , i loved sense mystery , suspense , creepiness i got early film . i can't explain it well , but there something carnivals people who work them little dark criminal . two teenaged couples obviously out night fun . typical teenage stuff . this movie made over 20 years ago , but our culture changed little since then . best part movie me when four teenagers hiding funhouse , they happen witness murder . they become trapped funhouse realize they extreme danger . me , most scary part film when one kids ( who hiding others ) drops his lighter " mutant " his father father son talk murder how fix problem . course gets attention dad he realizes there someone else funhouse ... someone who knows murder . he tries coax them out hiding says he just wants give lighter back . doesn't work , course .	1

this movie brilliant entertaining fresh , but sadly most reviewers this movie totally missed point . if you thought this just romantic comedy , then course you'd think this just run-of-the-mill , predictable movie . if you weren't exposed and/or no concept what hip hop before it crossover period , circa-1990 fake , gimmicky artists no skill like vanilla ice mc hammer who put out anything would sell records , don't watch this movie -- someone else only break it down you later . like amazon.com review ( jeff shannon ) says above ( please read carefully ) , least entertaining aspect this movie dre sidney relationship . gist movie how dre sid relationship written direct parallel commentary music business how hip hop lost its soul when it crossed over became commercial . every scene movie metaphorical attests this commentary . dre sid friendship innocent young kids 1980s parallels birth hip hop its innocent period . dre sid outside ( dating ) relationships parallel hip hop selling out just enough mainstream survive . dre ultimate marriage reece , fake , money-grubbing , status quo symbol , parallel hip hop crossover mainstream going commercial . dre sid hookup end ( pay close attention hotel scene dialogue when sid tells dre she can't review his cd ... dre lines " one moment you say you want me change next you're saying you want me stay same ... " ) . whole scene metaphorical true life debates music fans today ... everyone wants hip hop grow change , yet those unhappy changes ( such overcommercialism rise southern hip hop ) longing " pure days " when rappers real skills put out great music represent their intelligence , their skills their personal experience instead puttin ' out whatever flava-of-the-month style music sell most ( thus , selling out hip hop ) . finally , dre sid hookup official couple angie martinez hot97 like this film writer personal commentary ultimately , hip hop return its roots move forward ( kind like hip hop sankofa concept , looking back/understanding past order move forward ) . like i said , if you don't know what hip hop music pre-1990 , you won't understand half movie thus you won't appreciate what 4 5-star reviewers this movie see its creativity . this film written purpose i hope , despite meager sales , we get more like this one instead stereotypical , dumbed-down stuff hollwyood keeps pushing	1

what , stupid sequel crappy horror mess ? i not know studios this desperate some lousy cash . this franchise needs destroyed . skip this look product	-1
demetrius gladiators very good movie , classic sense term . many people his time adored victor mature , while critics sometimes claimed he melodramatic , but mature impressively right majority films which he cast . studio system smart way . this case , mature brings drama life almost single-handedly , certainly carries off this cast-of-thousands sequel robe beautifully . mature well suited 50s sword-and-sandal trend , i'd say this film , demille equally good samson delilah , among his best performances period . this film respectable interesting sequel robe , unequivocally worth seeing . what more , i can't agree jay robinson " over top " -- he just fascinating villain he robe , we're lucky more him role this movie . considering robinson became , all accounts , mentally obsessed his character roman emperor these two films rest his life , i'd say this movie even more fascinating regard . robinson one those actors who proves old saying it only takes one stand-out performance secure actor place history forever . robinson performance easily best roman emperor ever committed celluloid up until now , i claudius notwithstanding . short , don't sell this movie short , or you'll worse it . movie tone certainly different robe , but it genuinely satisfying hollywood entertainment fairly high order . budget generous , cast excellent , movie looks very good all most important aspects result . feel free bring popcorn , i'd recommend kleenex well .	1
i think there packaging or sticker compared this film pulp fiction . if . beyond minor superficial similarities - i dont see it . le samurai one most boring films ive watched recently without turning it off . retrospect i wish i turned it off or never wasted my time since ending so dull . imagine if breathless slightly more complicated plot , but main character no charisma . or if alphaville ( film not treatment ) more 100 times more boring . le samurai makes tokyo drifter seem like thrill ride . i not impressed this film any level . if you into bored . or if your so freaking smart you watch paint drying fill it significance , this film you	1
best tradition love comes softly love enduring promise , this surprisingly convincing lovely film made me smile rest day . teri polo particular shines impetuous headstrong photographer who comes wyoming whim when her friend answers singles ad her , finds what she never expected . andrew mccarthy utterly convincing blunt , hurting , rough-edged cowboy she finds there , chemistry them , clear their second scene together , so exquisite you could cut it knife . lovely , lovely film , surprisingly good dialogue captivating story two people drawn reluctantly together . i would absolutely recommend this any lover romance - better than even usual hallmark movie .	1

ve2 ton potential , but it just doesn't work out . brandy davis both cute sexy , course , but playboy testing limits much better showcase her , um , talents . not mean , but most film other women just aren't attractive , many sex scenes actually irritating because obnoxious soundtrack . contrary previous reviewer , massage scene fairly ordinary . girl-girl stripper scene most disappointing , however . it starts really well , straight girl gradually overcoming her shyness enjoying stripper , but even unrated version then fades black without any real action . only scene worth watching all blue-collar vignette , two girls one guy hooking up . stay away this one	1

denzel washington ( manchurian candidate , man fire ) plays police chief banyan key , fl where he sleeping sanaa lathan ( brown sugar ) who married dean cain ( tv lois clark , rat race ) bascially lathan finds out she dying she some many months live , which then she gives washington part money if she dies . soon after , lathan goes missing , maybe dead that when big kickaroo happens when someone frames him , so washington goes around trying correct things , trying not caught something he didnt . he also sexy cop partner , played eva mendes . some fun this , including hilarious john billingsley ( tv angel , white oleander , high crimes ) washington beer drinking buddy washington saves this complete disaster , there also nice sequence where washington falls out window onto balcony it comes apart he climb back up . mendes hot but she doesnt show anything here casting lathan femme fatale big miscasting . also starring nora dunn ( three kings , hebrew hammer ) . sweet locations help but plot weak	1
nutshell : mutiny during failed rebellion re-enacted graphically ! cast comprised people looked part rather than actors , film divided into five acts . each act focused incident graphic images , story line illustrated 1905 uprising , its convulsively violent consequences . power " battleship potemkin " maximized dramatized amplify impact historical incident balancing docu-drama like realism shrewd orchestration visually graphic images timely editing . what its all : save russian proletariat gentle stalinism ? stalin become " general secretary " soviet regime lenin became gravely ill . after lenin death 1924 , stalin commissioned this film , which significant , their depiction czarist government mob baby killing cossacks needed replaced regime would care nurture common peasant . theme salvation via stalinism pervasive effective throughout film . so effective , it also films weakness history not thought much stalin humanity toward russian peasants during his 31 year reign . [ 1922-1953]here specific example propaganda scene [ plot spoiler warning]for instance , depictions russian orthodox priest aboard battleship potemkin , supporting officers who slaughter crewmen refused eat maggot infested meat not believed . fact , priest shown mauling crewmen none other than his crucifix . honestly , such scenes tough swallow maggot infested meat , there many them . very obvious crude stalinist propaganda . bottom line : okay its propaganda -- but .... images theme powerful clear . emotions viewers inevitably provoked . this very good stuff . not honest -- but great cinema nonetheless ! dvd : image entertainment editionincredibly well preserved print eighty-one year old film ! transfer contained excellent video audio elements very clear mostly unflawed picture .	1
scenes marriage swedish film ingmar bergman . me , this one best films ever . it not only captures great story , but it so well . what makes movie so great you relate how they feel , act , generally take care issues . this isn't one those american films where person breaks off someone they start yelling throwing objects them . here , he telling his wife this other lover , she without emotions , just staring off , no real reactions whatsoever , way most would respond . this basically 3 or 5 hour film wife who believes their marriage great/perfect . it later she finds outs perhaps , marriage isn't so great when she listens patient decribe her marriage why she wants divorce . there , wife wants plan trip her husband try improve their marriage . he later says he woman while now , shortly there after , leaves her . after year so , they get together sign divorce papers , which turns out rough end . after some time , they get together again , some way , fall love once again , even though both married other people . there , movies ends . great film ! hard watch some american films now , because most just seem horrible , ways , corny . i'm glad i got see great film like this .	1

bashing mother-in-law extreme , ha , ha . think how our u.s. dollar devalued since this movie . $ 350,000 . 00 ? almost 20 people tried get it split among them ? now , you couldn't even buy decent condo southern california such meager amount . 1 or 2 bedrooms either downstairs or upstairs , 1 carport 1 parking space , hoa would still either $287.00 or even over $360.00 per month . so , if pentagon contractors charged $ 1,500 . 00 per toilet seat asked we taxpayers chip , it should no big deal all . so same token , spent mucho hundred billions dollars fight ridiculous war iraq most money going weaponry contractors or halliburton or blackwater should no big deal either if compare money value 5 decades ago . this crazily funny movie lot fun . well directed well acted	1
i agree one reviewer who said read book ... yes , all means , read book then watch this incredible film adaptation . yes , this film little dated - but aren't we all . it little cheesy spots , sure . but i feel truffaut really bradbury justice especially making sure only things we actually saw print titles books burnt . both book film powerful commentaries society . we really becoming more more society who wants everything spelled out us . all our technology , we allowed our minds , our hearts , our souls grow flaccid weak . we pledge our allegiance things really not serve our spirit ... things slowly gnaw out our insides make us hollow inside . i friend who recently bought home very nice set built bookcases built into wall den . he took sledge hammer them , resurfaced wall , put up his 72 " plasma flatscreen . i almost cried . i guess it because i love read . i guess it because i like feel . i guess it because i truly feel pit my soul this journey we call like such magnificent thing , i am disheartened all callousness we , society , allowed ourselves individually well collectively become . i put up review not too long ago where some people attacked judged my enthusiasm film . it really kind bothered me bit . almost point where i wanted stop writing reviews things i enjoyed wanted others also enjoy . you see what i doing ? i letting other people opinions made weight more validity than my own . that how society crumbles . that how " futuristic society " fahrenheit 451 allowed law establish ban reading . we must allow ourselves rise up out ashes our past decide who we want , what we want , what we want , where we want go . we must this individually we must this collectively . life much too precious simply go auto-pilot . i invite you watch this incredible movie . i invite you see it group friends . i invite you think it , stirred up it , then decide yourself ( while you still ) what kind life you want bring forth . change you wish see world ..	1

i would like begin saying this one most bizarre films i ever experienced my career movie buff . i seen some twist endings , some passionately bad french films , even some stalker films , but nothing compares cinematic genius i just witnessed . bunuel " virgin " , i didn't know what expect coming into this film . i ready anything , but interestingly enough nothing prepare you this film . deeply rooted cinematic symbolism , we watch two very interesting devises used bring forth overall theme this film . two devises i never seen used movie , until now . first obvious . bunuel successfully uses two different actresses play same role conchita . first i thought perhaps it going one those " twin " double-cross films where these two girls used this older wealthy man all his money . i wrong . similar title this film , this film passions desires . it divulges emotion obsession , reaction man someone he desperately sexually desires . mathieu our possible victim this story . while both not most interesting characters ( both flaws troubles ) , they provide some structured characters . mathieu willing give up everything this woman he hardly knows , but physically attracted her . it hard say he loves her , but he lust her . dual role conchita this film used two purposes . first distraction , while second emotion . both conchitas different their own way used push forward story . whenever bunuel needed convey different emotion , he would bring actress best represented emotion . first it confusing , but film progressed you began see less less separate actresses , but instead one character . it impressive how bunuel created this illusion . i mentioned above , there two devises i never seen movie before . i explained above use two women one female role , but second bit subtler . i briefly mentioned it above how these two women ( one character ) used distract . if you pay attention film terrorism big part universe surrounding mathieu . while he pines continually conchita , world around him falling apart . bombings deaths all time high , yet he doesn't really seem notice this . he so caught up conchita it seems like nothing else exists . he oblivious his surroundings . fact , i would go so far say we also oblivious surroundings . bunuel this job keeping our eye focused interchanging women we sometimes forget or miss actions surrounding this film . i believe bunuel trying prove point obsession obscure your vision . it blurs your eyes forces you miss crucial elements your surroundings . it isn't until end when we reminded violently truth surrounding our characters . i felt bunuel slapping me face final scene . i nearly forgotten myself terrorism outside , but easily he reminded me . this spectacular film really opened my eyes completely new way filmmaking . it reminded me some early works favorite director mine francois ozon . both these talented artists their own way creating world emotion , both it some most beautiful strokes their mechanical brush . i would recommend this film anyone willing experience radical , yet provocative filmmaking its best . you impressed . i cannot wait include this film my collection watch over over again . thanks criterion , they provided beautiful packaging this obscure film . grade : ***** out ****	1

this film course now somewhat obscure considering all since time film life christ . jeffery hunter most handsome christ you ever see screen . apostles all clean cut . movie features very colorful clothing catch eye . great musical score miklos roza , which particular favorite classical music fans request radio even today ! gospel rather compressed ministry christ particular . however , not say it ineffective . sermon mount scene actually encapsulated all comprehensive review christian philosophical points boiled down one mass meeting . movie not adherent bible events contains lot fiction , especially respect activity aristocracy romans . it tries tell several stories , such barabbas , roman officer , mary mother christ , john baptist definitely most beautiful salome you ever see dance screen . taking cross , whipping , death , all handled very delicately . not too much blood or grief . jeffery hunter seen after easter rising shown symbolically end very well apostles gathered beach his shadow overwhelms them he tells them depart preach gospel they leave 2 2 . really effective scene movie so entrenched 50s culture . seen this movie child sixties seeing it again now this century , i think it should not too criticized our 20/20 perception now . back then it after all different time culture , one not exist today should viewed perhaps nostalgic way , worth viewing , but don't depend it filling you biblical truth .	1

i thought this film title . i wanted french film called le papillon , older gentleman who becomes grandfather-like figure young girl , but i wasn't too careful selected butterfly figuring it english translation title . when i viewed it saw little boy instead little girl , discovered older man teacher not grandfather , dialogue spanish , not french , i realized i wrong title . i decided keep title watch it , discovered beautiful moving film . story begins idyllic time setting : spain days prior fascist revolution . it appears simpler time colorful village life not unlike two french films my mother castle its companion my father glory . story revolves around young boy named moncho his first year school . he taught gentle don gregorio , wise man who also knows importance training young minds . we also see loving older/younger brother relationship develop moncho andrea , budding musician who believes he one saxophone lesson away becoming musical dom juan . he also close friend rocque . whatever teacher cannot teach him , moncho believes rocque andrea . we see moncho grow under his teacher guidance , yet film progresses , we know something terrible happen which occurs when tremors fascist revolt touch their town townspeople become divided based more fear than conviction . film poignant largely because way its innocent beginning changes tragic end , reminding us how strong self preservation , how easily young minds learn hate . i've ordered le papillon know i'll finally see film i wanted see first place , but i'm glad i also butterfly my collection . enjoy !!!	1
although given short shrift few critics who watched it , this worthy effort , marked good acting , direction , technicals , intelligent script . although state undress through much film , kelly lynch given opportunity display full panoply her acting range there essentially only two actors . , so often independent films , all involved opportunity truly creative . desert setting enhanced starkness extreme emotions which viewer exposed .	1

20 years ago , there terrible accident mine valentine day . following year one miners , harry warden , takes terrible revange those responsible accident . since day , there no celebration valentine day little town valentine buff . until now ( 1981 ) . but harry warden seems returned stop celebration . music music quite good , but it doesn't lead film any direction , so it not helping . story recycled , which good , but could much more minimalistic . why not just party let miner kill kids ? trying put twist story " explaining " things seldom very helpful . murderar places human hearts valentine boxes which distasteful but not really scary . variation holiday theme , could bit more focused .	1
i love it when two my favorite actors movie together . when one off screen , you other keep you entertained . when they're screen together , it movie-making its best . plot itself leaves bit desired . film production stop-and-go so long , i heard director changed direction before it finished . my guess some what lost what missing movie , particularly regards understanding benicio character properly . nonetheless , tommy lee jones benicio del toro shine throughou t.p.s. animal lover , i love two leads movie pro-animal too	1
this movie defies normal conventions much storytelling visually . plot easy follow but real meat movie contained visual scenes . much like foreign films , cell much more ambiguous non literal than mainstream american films . you could even say plot pedistrian cliche , but heart movie how visuals executed . you drawn into serial killer , carl mind . d'onofrio persona disappears you left madman lost , vulnerable abused human . vince vaughn compelling enough carry his scenes doesn't overact . . lo also low key although i don't think she convey complexities her character . she her job but doesn't go deep enough make it outstanding performance . beware strong violent images . if you stomach it though , you may see original , beautifully designed film . i'd rather see gore this context rather than low brow slasher/horror type flicks	1
great actors/acting . seen it previous purchase wanted add my collection . lots twists turns	1

this terrible , terrible film . it incredibly boring , lame , tedious , filled bad acting , bad direction , etc ., etc .. i know it very popular time , but it still really awful . i difficult time sitting through whole thing , it rather sleep inducing . i wanted see least one friday 13th films , so i watched this one . many murders ripped off mario bava superior twitch death nerve ( aka bay blood ) , so film wasn't even original . we know , there roughly around 1000 sequels , 500 tv shows , jason dolls , jason official murder tools , jason hockey mask , etc ., etc .. film one biggest hits 1980 , year hollywood started decline . coincidence ? who knows ? i just know i wasted 90 minutes my time ...	-1
few reviewers seem disappointed perplexed this movie " unresolved " ending , all i say " i felt same way when i first saw this masterpiece " . advice : watch it commentary after you see film then wait couple weeks watch it again , you blown away . synopsis : rich girl travels some friends yacht , they stop island , she disappears . one her friends goes searching her missing girls boyfriend . you see way movie studio or viewer today might say this film . yet it isn't really . it really " adventure " or quest young woman ( rich girls friend ) into full womanhood . i remember watching this film one day getting end thinking " i don't get it " . whirlwind questions came mind , then i thought i should watch it commentary , see if would help . it . imagery so well explained you think how it you didn't see . way director used nature say so much his characters . examples : island they all disembark dry lifeless lives they all live . boyfriend always seems surrounded background incredible architecture , yet he sold out his dream build great things . close-up rich girl boy-toy sex , you tell she couldn't care less . last scene where broken boy-toys side screen all you see blank wall , but our heroines side there volcano . i mean how you go wrong scenes like these ? those just few . but then again you go this film mentality it not just bunch nonsense screen like unfortunately we see too much today . you actually watching work art , like all works art different people different points view . so give it chance don't go thinking you find easy answers questions it makes . life full questions , would it real art if it didn't make you ponder these questions	1

if you think any s**t walt disney made pinnacle american animation , think again !! heavy metal crushes everything adolf disney made ( he anti-semetic , hence " adolf " ) . i don't know why this only gets 4 star average while there virtually no criticism overrated pile dogs**t nightmare before christmas ( tim burton sucks ) . i recommend this fans alternative animation . this movie , this guy lands space give his daughter green orb , which absorbs him tells girl its stories how it wreaked havoc throughout galaxy . there many different worlds ranging futuristic city hover cars world reminiscent mayan civilization . however , all them , there lots violence , profanity , bare female flesh , tour de force guy his late-teens . soundtrack great , it songs groups like black sabbath , blue oyster cult , devo , grand funk railroad . if you want something different terms animation , this you . if you're die-hard disney fanatic , stear clear this !!	1

even if you haven't read book you'll probably get message this film . most ideas filtered into consciousness western man , especially phrase big brother watching you . surely everyone knows what this means . cast perfect : burton , cusack , hamilton , hurt seem fit their parts exactly . it shock told location shots filmed areas london actually existence 1984 . i recognized battersea power station , london university senate house . those places reflect totalitarianism 1930s , decade produced wwii . book written 1948 ( obviously ) , which only 3 years after ending war . fact conditions post-war britain almost worse than during war itself . austerity watchword . rationing prevailed . bombsite rubble everywhere london . russia , former ally , now enemy . orwell working bbc , he must developed sensitivity potential ways which public could deceived manipulated . it didn't take much projecting imagine how things threatened develop , especially history pre-war communist show-trials executions , rantings nazi oratory draw . all this very well depicted film . warning book these things weren't happening eurasia ( nazi germany ) or eastasia ( russia ) but oceania ( us uk ) . airstrip one uk re-named : place transatlantic bombers land take off . national anthem titled : oceania , ' tis thee . so orwell satire targeting home territory . threat everchanging enemy meant way keep home population under control . vision utterly bleak . however , if film flaw , it visual shabbiness almost too much . it just little over top : if settings fraction less threadbare brutal , then thoughtcrime its cure could perhaps even more chilling . difficult tell . john hurt --- what name part .	1

i bought this movie when i serious vampire-story kick , it got here kick waneing . so i put off watching it , because frankly cover looks like every other silly sex-kittens-and-bloodsuckers vamp flick out there , just today teenagers instead last decade teenagers . i nothing against s-k -- b-s films , but i specific mood want watch them . today , i decided get off my behind ( or rather , sit * * my behind ... ) , stop stalling because i afraid how bad it might , actually watch it . my expectations very , very low . i pleasantly surprised . it fairly well - characters mostly hold together . bits where they go all " natural born killers " filming lame every other film that used them , but rest decently competently acted . all all , it pretty darn good job . they could gone screwed it up but they didn't . hollywood , that major achievement . if i say anything plot i might give something away , would actually shame , because there sort plot it doesn't go strictly according standard script . it sticks close involve bunch pretty , pimple-free early twenties kiddies wearing little possible but still ; it manages few shreds originality . it maintains what integrity it while conforming formula script pretty kids bad situation vampires .	1

honors thoughtful well little " slice life " moral we've all heard before : what makes you happy take time live your life . director alex keshishian screenwriter william mastrosimone , however , don't knock you over head its theme and/or morals . there some scenes where you're expecting probable happen they don't: e.g. , after simon cooks gorky , rooster , you expect his master furious --- when simon finally meets up son he abandoned , you expect some kind tearful reunion ---- you certainly think monty going graduate honors . end results these scenes , however , avoid usual cliche . joe pesci delightfully understated his role , although he never really becomes coochy coo loveable , you understand his pains shortcomings ; brendan fraser starts out pretty snooty insufferable but he matures his relationship both pesci moira kelly ( who delightful courtney ) , fraser becomes more sympathetic character ; patrick dempsey adds some lightweight humor gorky master , josh hamilton eschews usual pain butt role believable touching change hear t.t he movie definitely manipulative , but its heart right place its cast takes it seriously , so it ends up charming little film strong reaffirmation human spirit	1

bollywood loves churn out action films , but indians could learn some lessons jewish-american cartel hollywood concerning story construction this classic sport melodrama presented traditional three act format - three 40-minute blocks produce 2-hour movie . much brilliantly construction film its story . opening scene , antagonist introduced hooks viewer when she reveals premise plot - rotten season where attendance falls below 800,000 year allow her escape her lease city relocate her recently inherited cleveland indians baseball team miami , so she invited has-beens screwballs training camp aim composing team stinks enough cause attendance drop . remainder scenes first act introduce protagonist ( catcher played tom beringer ) all main characters : team coach , born-again pitcher , voodoo man , pretty boy , willy mays hayes , wild thing . nice subplots tensions introduced these unforgettable characters , after which main subplot presented catcher his ex-fiancee . all these characters no idea team new owner expects them stink - they're all playing coaching determination . but act one ends them playing their first game losing 9-0 . act two opens scene office where owner complaining general manager team bad , but it doesn't stink . she complains there even some improvement . so she increases complications characters taking away their perks making them fly propeller plane rather than jet . while they continue lose , subplots tensions continue characters . however , they also continue show improvement especially when coach notices wild thing pitching would improve if he wore glasses . owner responds more complications - their propeller plane replaced bus . end act two , their record 60 wins 61 losses . that when plot given its turning point - coach finds out none them job baseball after season ends because they hired lose . after coach shares this players , catcher says there only one option available them - win whole darn thing ( winners , they could work team next season ) . players need 32 victories stay baseball after this season . act three begins 31 victories later when they play yankees championship , who they've struggled against all season . this act 41 minutes inning-by-inning action , conflict , suspense . melodramatic fashion , they win ! it awesome climax succession dramatic suspense scenes . hollywood subplot fashion , catcher gets his girl	1

reviewer rightly pointed out , this film one most influential films cinema history . masterpiece editing , cinematography , all around directing . it shame , then , because subject matter - much like communism " battleship potemkin " racism " birth nation " - it film doomed always taboo , guilty pleasure film buffs . i sincerely doubt it kind movie you'd watch your girlfriend , but historical piece it still recommended . 1934 : nazi party , now control germany , holds party rally nuremburg . leni riefenstahl hired adolf hitler film it " documentary " show young germans . it opens shots clouds , flying over city nuremburg , finally showing adolf hitler plane landing . then it collection cheering crowds , hitler youth festivals , military parades ... lots military parades . it , however , feast eyes . riefenstahl sees it every single shot serves purpose , every scene flows together nicely . some my personal favorite sequences include : 1 ) cat looking down hitler car it passes ; 2 ) addressing workers ; 3 ) great bit cutting which men bring their torches together close , we cut firework going off . most amusing , course , propaganda value film . there long sequence beginning showing hitler youth laughing , playing , eating food just young boys . watching scenes like this makes one almost think , " wow , it must've cool nazi ! " this complex , fact , still exists today , which people watch documentaries may intended or unintended falsehoods readily believe it . this film important three reasons . first , it obviously classic if not respected then should least studied terms filming . second , it outstanding piece history , showing regime seduced nation would eventually move onto its own destruction . third , it important see nazis they wanted see themselves , realize how they could seduced whole nation . not everything out hitler mouth " purge jews . " dr. anthony santoro explains his commentary ( which , way , excellent listen , especially when he points out few bloopers ) germany just gone through their own great depression lived under chaos weimar republic . this film meant show germans , " look us now : we united , we strong - we better than ever ! " most all , it faith party . santoro makes excellent observation german army itself only two or three minutes film ; rest units paramilitary units under direct control nazis . film portrays united germany not mere power german people , but under leadership direction one man : adolf hitler . some people sensitive subject matter , so this film may not them . however , if you want see history , or you're interested examining filmmaking ... or you're just curious , i would definately suggest watching it .	1

great military movie . it shows what airmen during vietnam war ( or american war , if you're reading this vietnam ) wanted - take fight enemy . great wish airmen come true big screen . retired air force member , i laugh all naval antics shore leave because today military makes them verboten . carrier landings bars angeles city or olongapo no longer exist since us military ordered out there . still , guys great fun letting loose this movie then faced death when time came . scene where willem dafoe his pilot avionics failure , it made me sit edge my seat , because former avionics technician who worked f-16s , i could feel fear subtle panic they facing during battle . i always ensured my avionics components worked so our aircrews would not experience sensation . note : captain , who trying aircrew disobeying orders , fred dalton thompson ; he wasn't mentioned credits some reason . great movie storyline , superb antics troops shore leave , really cool aerial footage . must add your war film collection	1
best way describe best best 3 4 say they solid action films nice display martial arts spread evenly throughout each one . phillip rhee terrific job pulling off punches , kicks , throws great mastery . fight sequences very believable exciting fun watch . most fights phillip rhee against multiple attackers , these scenes all very well . camera angles offer good glimpses each technique hits all look quite real . rhee definitely very adept martial artist , it very clear screen he knows what he doing . however , those you expecting intricate one one fights jet li/jackie chan hong kong style you may disappointed . but if you're merely looking quick paced action story well written enough serve links action sequences featuring actors who actually act , you'll happy checking this dvd out . it great , solid action fun , i would recommend it , especially fans best best best best 2 . best part you get two films one dvd , so you really can't go wrong here . one last thing : gina gershon best best 3 . girl not only great looker , but she very fine actress well . so not only you get great action , decent story good acting , you get great looking women too . i highly recommend this film	1

playboy asks why this movie hasn't become cult classic . i'll tell you . first all , painting cover not look like actual woman film . one or two reviewers liked way she looks . okay , each his own , but don't surprised if you find her unattractive . second , nudity . no , she not nude all time . nor half time . nor fourth time . nor ... she nude few seconds now then . no more than any other movie . third , movie only 79 minutes , first four them skippable . movie mostly man fighting neanderthal survivor . both behave more childishly than primitively . you'll see more convincing behavior clan cave bear . there no explicit sex scenes . also , no effective sex scenes any kind . even fight scenes disappointing . oh , i mention dialogue joke ? bottom line : almost every viewer , this movie not worth watching even once .	1
reading other reviews this film , it certainl seems if nobody really luke warm young guns . it either loved because it relatively accurate or disliked because it so fictional . or viewer enjoys it because estevez other cast members solid or it disliked because it " brat pack " set 1880 new mexico . well , let me throw out my 2 cents . firstly , i've read alot books billy kid while movie not 100% accuarate , it relatively close . i'm going alittle bit my memory here , but i don't recall singlen incident movie complete piece fiction . billy taken john tunstall - english gentleman , who john chisum , " butting heads " murphy -dolan faction lincoln , new mexico . this small group who worked tunstall eventually become deputized regulators who , unfortunately , killed sheriff brady after , became wanted men themselves . now i read one review said kid essentially " loner " his involvement " gang " regulators couldn't more wrong . well , this reviewer clearly doesn't know very much billy kid . kid may many bad qualities ( personally i don't think he ) , but disloyalty not one them . fact , his loyalty john tunstall his decision avenge murder his boss - one man who really gave bonney home - eventually cost him his lfe . there would many opportunities very early lincoln county war kid get out area , but he chose not . estevez depiction kid wasn't far off mark . it said he always smile his face didn't carry gudge too long . but make no mistake - he cold-blooded killer any who resided west late 1800 . fact exception bell , deputy who guarding him who chose resist kid when he retrieved gun left him privy , i don't think kid killed single person who didn't deserve it or wasn't trying kill kid himself . regulators interesting assortment characters i think actors who portrayed them pulled it offreasonably well . today , i would problem seeing charlie sheen dick brewer - leader regulators - but when this film made , he fine . jack palance his usual great self his portrayal murphy , " bad " guy who responsible tunstall murder . terrance stamp fine tunstall - fact , he very convincing man who commanded such loyalty few very young men died avenge his death . keifer sutherland very entertaing doc scurlock . fact , i can't think anybody who really didn't stand out their performance . this movie not red river or man who shot liberty valance - it never going mentioned when great westerns all time discussed . but like silverado , example , it very , very entertaining provides reasonably realistic depiction one west most enduring characterts - billy kid .	1

admittedly this film propaganda produced during occupation fascist germany , but it very educational explaining why more americans probably killed french during wwii than saved them . but this film shows us what vichy government producing way propaganda , not what germans made them . including northern africa campaign serious battles where allied forces attacked french military loyal petain vichy government , well millions frenchmen who assisted nazi war machine their munitions factories , there no question french more enemy allies than they would ever willing admit today . anyone who thinks french diplomatic treachery new phenomenon war against islamofascism , they should see this film . no wonder chabrol widely condemned france shining light this ugly chapter french history . it something any nation should ashamed . but unfortunately they learned nothing their ignominy well documented their own propagandists . hollywood great job fooling world into thinking " free french " majority fighting german occupation , but fact vast majority supported petain his fellow collaborators until tide turning favor allies . but what new ? if you interested this subject robert paxton book " vichy france " even more eye opener .	1

professionalsi recently watched rerun this entertaining action-packed movie cable tv . i remember i watched it theatre during late 60 while i still young college student . it my second movie lee marvin lead cast . first point blank . since then , i always impressed him seen most his action movies , including dirty dozen . professionals definitely one kind movie which i truly say : they don't make them like this anymore ! yes , me , it truly great western classic . it relatively simple plot terrific story , even though there some twists surprises right through very end : four solders fortune , each regarded specialist his own chosen field , hand-picked rich texan businessman rescue his wife , who captured mexican rebels . ransom us$ 100,000 . setting aftermath mexican revolution . four soldiers fortune rico ( lee marvin ) , cool principled tactician gunnery expert ( he really cool his pump shot-gun ); bill ( burt lancaster ) , wise-cracking adventurer dynamite expert ; hans ( robert ryan ) , sensitive compassionate wrangler ; jake ( woody stroke ) , sharp scout/tracker archery expert . it obvious these brave men who lived their tactical expertise sharp instincts . they paid handsomely - us$ 10,000 per head - carry out mission . vast scenery movie magnificent : colourful rocks , barren desert rugged terrains . against this enchanting backdrop , many action sequences took place , four specialists skillfully out-manoeuvre bunch mexican desert marauders /or rebels . dialogue often crisp witty . there some very memorable lines e.g. bill putting load dynamite rock , he said others : " you light this fuse , you got thirty seconds run like hell , then dynamite - not faith - move mountains into this pass . peace ! brothers . " most cruel scene when four specialists witnessed gang mexican rebels , led raza ( jack palance ) massacred train load mexican soldiers . [ movie , bill explained hans rationale rebels ' merciless attack . soldiers sadistic torturers . ] most exciting part movie probably surprise attack , planned military precision , raza fortress rescue mrs grant ( claudia cardinale ) . it this scene rico bill , seemingly bewildered , began realise something wrong . their astonishment , mrs grant turned out raza mistress . they caught moral dilemma : rico bill apparently fought alongside raza during mexican revolution . both respected raza his ideals . other hand , they honour their contract letter rich texan businessman , mr grant ( ralph bellamy ) . rico quickly stopped bill killing raza eventually rescued mrs grant , raza his rebels hot their heels . ensuing scenes beautifully choreographed bill set out diversionary measure slow down their pursuit , while rico , hans jake rebellious mrs grant took off texas via different route . most touching climactic scene movie actually closing scene , when rico , hans , jake mrs grant eventually crossed border into texas rendervous mr grant his men . next scene showed bill appeared out trail dust rendervous wounded raza . mrs grant rushed forward raza falling into her embrace . mr grant then told rico , bill , hans jake they fulfilled their contract asked them leave . instead , amidst short scuffle mr grant men , they quickly put wounded raza wagon mrs grant taking off into mexico . they then rode off into sunset , their professional code honour intact . i really enjoyed watching this entertaining action-packed movie once again . four specialist-characters played very well movie , especially lee marvin rico burt lancaster bill who stood out . jack palance , fine actor ( i enjoyed watching him bronk tv series ) , raza his part well too . claudia cardinale mrs grant provided some eye candy movie .	1

i always loved cross-overs , especially animation . first teamup batman superman expected : filled tension both over lois lane , especially way things . both heroes take some time find some footing each other , learning work together before their super-villains try take them out . this character development accomplished amazing degree ; watching movie you could really feel emotions coming them ! why voice-actors get little respect this country ? there should award them specifically . kevin conroy always batman my mind , mark hamil joker . even tim daly fine job superman . dana delany lois lane always terrific makes this lois sexy personable . animation superb , it almost good some japanese animation . batman " cartoons " far best american animation i've ever seen . batman brought best out superman , joker , well , always scene-stealing ever . i never felt lex luthor much super villain , no offense those who like lex superman world . i mean , he ruthless genius all , but he no joker ! one character i felt sorry mercy ( lex assistant ) geez , she got beat up lot this episode ( harley , batman) ! unfortunately , music not good it could , considering this first meeting man steel caped crusader . it should more intense fiery . oh well , otherwise , i no complaints . whenever superman crosses over batman world , he becomes better hero .	1

wow . this movie bad . but it good laugh if you're mood some brainless fun . patrick bergen gives one great over-the-top performances all time psycho husband . among many major plot holes : hubby smacks julia because he thought she checking out their new neighbor his boat . then few days later he arranging them both go sailing same guy , his boat ! ( wouldn't psychotically jealous husband try keep his wife away man he thinks she lusting after ? )also , fact she would fake her drowning ocean - but flush her wedding ring ( halfway ) down toilet - not smartest move say least . might wanna just ditch ring ocean while you're faking your own death next time , julia ! gotta admit though , i loved psycho hubby would sneak into julia house actually take time rearrange cans cupboard before he hides . what neat freak . final plot hole involves her new boyfriend iowa , who would likely more interested patrick bergen than julia , if you know what i'm saying	1

i saw few scenes couldn't even continue watching . i like lot charles bronson movies . examples include " death hunt , " 80s " death wish " series , " white buffalo . " but his acting this movie unrealistic . he not act like real apache . bronson seems overdo it " stoic . " relative i watched few scenes just switched channels . bronson out his element trying portray real apache . paul newman much more realistic job when he portrays apache-raised white man " hombre , " which i purchased amazon . i applaud bronson trying portray movie more sympathetic plight apaches trying avoid reservation confinement 1880s . given time period , perhaps bronson should hired roman gabriel instead . he realistic job portraying cherokee indian " undefeated , " which also released around same time ( give or take couple years )	1

this typical kind entertaining 1950s adventure film all family , kind " they don't make anymore " . so if you liked " elephant walk " ( 1954 ) or " king solomon mines " ( 1950 ) , this one most definitely you ! what stands out , imo , besides special effects ( good 1954 ) scenes dealing marabunta invasion , great chemistry sultry , elegant , appealing eleanor parker ( joanna leiningen ) , her prettiest most ladylike , but same time , full passion , ardour desire love real man ... there he , charlton heston ( leiningen ) , peak his macho-man magnetism ladies ( my mother told me she absolutelly swooned over him around time he made this film ) . he conveys very well character contradictions his insecurities man his desire this wondrous woman ( parker ) , chosen his wife his brother . first part film plenty scenes fully display , elegantly 1950s style , sexual tension characters played both leads . they make one handsomest couples ever paired . william conrad ( " jake fatman " fame ) good friendly comissioner . abraham sofaer plays similar role than " elephant walk " , but this time more sympathetic towards heroine . some footage must filmed location , but almost all scenes involving leading players obviously filmed paramount backlot . good entertainment ! dvd no extras though . print quality very good !	1

divergence opinion among reviewers regarding this film interests me - reflects changes media itself undergone , inspiring me add my bit dialog here what its worth . first , i confess not seen dvd . i saw under capricorn 20 years ago nuart , revival theatre los angeles , where it played late night feature double-bill strangers train packed house . showing memorable . middle film , tension absorbed audience point where you could literally heard pin drop there - cliche goes . feeling truly amazing - energy watching one great cinematic masterpieces - under capricorn , great it - hardly one greatest film masterpieces . yet , many reviewers here would surprised know surprising number most respected critics consider this rather musty treasure golden age technicolor - 1945-55 - one hitchcock greatest achievements ! part problem " action " this " costume drama " hails age when ne plus ultra special effects stuff like charlton heston parting red sea ten commandments ( several years after 1949 release this film ) . there really no viable action speak film - which , if films academic subtitles , could called : under capricorn : hitch meets henry james . really , it jamesian novel film , before movies james ' novels came into vogue , although heiress , one most lauded popular films 1949 , hollywood first major adaptation james novel . one see flashes under capricorn more droll moments french new wave cinema 1960 - many whose makers nursed hitchcock . but , calling this rather serious film merely slow-paced would euphemistic . film bombed box office back 1949 , would probably not fare much better , if well , today . then what exactly earned this glorified rather messy soap plaudits some most selective critics , enduring cult following , standing ovations revival showings ? not storyline , trite even melodramatic 1940s . not visuals . there not whole lot commend under capricorn any technical category . what great , making film appear larger than perhaps it , surfeit elusive combination awesome acting on-screen chemistry ( could it hitch really great director actors some claimed ? ) . these actors don't need script or props - , truth , they don't get much either , yet - they cast big-time spell . other reviewers concentrated performances central characters - beautiful , strained couple - played joseph cotten , gorgeous ingrid bergman one her most fetching screen appearances - if her character , played hilt , seemingly somewhat vapid heart . these seasoned pros brilliant , subtlety their portrayals , which their characters show truly lifelike , complete unconsciousness what going around them , their bittersweet devotion each other , catalyzes dramatic tension . but center stage this film belongs without doubt , moral battle it evolves protagonist antagonist drama , played respectively magnificent michael wilding , what must simply called larger than life performance , " aunt clary boy " who comes australia " make his fortune " , great british heavy , margaret leighton . action here , which unfold - moral . under capricorn , essence , old fashioned morality play , wilding character , urbane , polished deeper sense , puts `shining armor ' altruism engages furious , yet utterly muted combat , leighton . latter flawlessly projects probably less twenty minutes screen time one great evils age , character fueled entirely envy , desperate , nasty have-not , little or no formal education , utterly lost fury her blindly narrow , furtive , conditioned scheming . escalation this conflict gives film its noted ballast . moral extremes us played out against usual banal , superficial , prosaic social contexts , ponderously crafted sets , costumes finally retired , our real faces revealed what they . wilding character says bergman his incredible farewell scene : " i suppose i'll first man who ever went australia , not return fortune " , she never know how much he loved her , how much he'd sacrificed . sublime .	1
i consider myself pretty big horror fan . i enjoy many different kinds horror movies usually find one or two things movie make it worth watching . sometimes it actor , sometimes it just one gory scene , sometimes it atmosphere . like i said , i usually find something enjoy horror movie no matter how bad it . sadly , i can't say same my friends or other horror " fans " i've met . most time they're typical horror fans who hate anything isn't serious . personally i think it self image thing most people . they're afriad someone might mistake them " mainstream " or corny when it comes down their horror opinion . if you judge horror movie weather or not it scared crap out you , most time your going left high dry . horror movies come many styles , key understand just enjoy ride . friday 13th part viii - jason takes manhattan one those few 1980 gems i hold close my heart . it classic example how dark gritty 80 horror scene back then . jason take manhattan chop full dirty , brooding scenes city it really helps set stage jason what he best ! chop , hack stab his young victems ! looking plot ? you won't find one here ! this your basic big hair , bad acting , 1980 slasher fest ! nothing movie corny , back when they made film thought serious perspective . times change ideas change . sure it might outdated but it classic my book . long live jason voorhees !	1

this short finds stan ollie hapless stable boys who doing their job usual incompetence when they hear valuable blue boy stolen . they resolve ones bring him back claim reward , since they know blue boy name one horses stable . millionaire whose mansion they arrive throws them down key tells them take blue boy inside . he can't come down person because he middle bath . first stan questions wisdom this , but ollie tells him what man says goes . both baffled when millionaire tells them put blue boy piano says he always up there , but resolve get down it right away . this illustrates their childlike innocence ; first they question seemingly bizarre request , but ultimately go it utmost seriousness . there also racy ( time ) sight gag when ollie falls top nude female statue breaks it , putting it back together again middle piece facing wrong direction . gentleman he , ollie puts his jacket over middle section he picks it up puts it back where he thinks it belongs , but since he obviously can't see which side which , it goes wrong . he doesn't think he this ; he explains stan statue looks way because millionaires eccentric twisted , not like other people , things odd ways . however , police discovered real blue boy before horse came mansion , deliver it mansion after horse finally put top piano . millionaire mother also arrived police , shocked flabbergasted see horse emerge behind curtain . furious , owner takes off after stan , ollie , horse , but ends up shooting policeman instead . there number funny gags titlecards , though i wouldn't consider this one their strongest or funniest , i would say it one their strongest second-tier silents	1
ohh no , please mr. corny demon-thing , don't hurt me ! this movie just seemed really suck . while it scare me ( mainly because only thing scary this movie monster growl , then you see monster feel better ) it still stunk usual smell b-rated monster flicks . watching such flicks almost hobby mine , i'd say , triple threat match among this monster ( whose name forgotten or not even mentioned ) , rawhead rex , grim ( similarly named film ) , i'd say rawhead would go all way , but going back movie , it pretty cheesey what all ho-hum acting , ho-hum story , ho-hum characters . i advise you stay away this movie . just ignore it maybe it'll go away	1

storyline movie simple one : two soldiers captured people who live mountains . leader people mountains wants trade them his son , who prison . so leader tells two captured men write their mothers tell them come get them they make deal , so so forth . movie not one greatest movies i seen , but it not terrible piece . ending great completely unexpected . , i'm not sure if it just me , but plot character motivation seemed derived viewer common sense rather than any real motive movie . example older soldier kills sheep herder ; whole exchange seems like something out monty python . throughout movie there sense humor , me person i watched it laughing hysterically few scenes ( most notable when prisoners get drunk ) random times throughout . overall film gave off surrealist feel . it never quite seemed real all . exchanges characters just keep getting more more unrealistic ( i'm not sure if writer planned or not , but it seem lag near end ) . movie definitely loses points front . also there never seemed any real connection things . beginning threw me off , when they attacked them brought them back horses threw me off . it somewhat difficult get into movie , but once it got going it easier watch , then it drug then it over . not recipe success my eyes . although i'm not sure if way russian cinema , but certainly isn't way american cinema runs , least not kind deemed good quality . but overall i would recommend watching it , it good movie . but sure you're watching it someone else so you able laugh them share few raised eyebrows plot how doesn't seem realistic .	1
well , lot said , but myself , i not really preapred watch this movie my 7 year old . i think he handled it pretty well , but this not movie children , specifically . you really not want go sleep right after this movie . make some time watch something else . tricky part cartoon used here make 100% wwii movie . you think you watching anime , but movie could made any other media , such poignant experience same . moreover , there very little action this movie . this movie not you , if you think war necessary evil , unless you ready change your mind . war never , never , never , necessary . if you think americans fought " good " war ( wwii , course ) , again , watch this only if you ready bend your vision little , or lot . fire-storming big metropolis no military value , no matter who bombing whom . fire-storming crime agains humanity , just like nazi gas chambers , russian concentration camps ( gulags ) . thankfully , movie spares us atomic bombing japan , maybe greatest war crime ever perpetrated . but , honest , this movie really not touch politics , or historic revisionisms . it really simply shows you sad story two orfans , trying survive defeated japan , end world war ii . you cannot watch this your kids . you watch it your little man , or woman	1

this 1999 film directed istvan szabo , although three hours long , lot going it . set hungary movie covers three generations hungarian jewish family , sonnenscheins . late 19th century , ignatz ; his brother gustave his adopted sister hannah ; who his natural cousin whom he marries , change their names " sors " order " assimilate " into hungarian society . ignatz son adam even converts roman catholicism wins medal fencing 1936 olympics . after silently witnessing his father die hands nazis , third generation sonnenschein/sors son ivan attempts avenge his father death joining stalin communist party . ralph fiennes ( lately " constant gardener " ) plays all three ignantz/adam/ivan characters through three generations it admirably . young hannah played jennifer ehle ; older hannah rosemary harris , mother ehle real life . william hurt plays ivan friend knorr . both score filming beautifully . many war concentration camp scenes shot black white . sad theme easily stated . eyes oppressors it matters not if you change your name or not . if you choose hate whole nation people because who they , nothing stop you . even though film all awfulness anti-semitism , there sunshine here resiliant character hannah who " breathed freely " always looked beautiful photograph . even through three hours long , this film well worth your time , both all-to-relevant theme fine acting	1

i gave this movie 4 stars not because i enjoyed movie but because i think it important see it . it bit like when you're little you're parents allow you something they know hurt you ( like touch something hot ) . it painful maybe even cruel , but you learn something it stay you rest your life . watching this movie hard me . although i friends didn't dress quite so oddly , main characters story very true my school experience . i see some reviewers believe movie ' campy ' , ' melodramatic ' ' exaggerated ' i am here tell you it not , it entirely realistic . i also see many people found it funny . i suppose if you'd never through things main character it may seem funny , but those us lived life it really wasn't . movie left me terribly depressed ( i've out school 8 years ) . it ended abruptly no resolution or any kind closure , you're left feeling utter futility hopelessness . isn't necessarily bad , just hard bare . who should see this movie ? parents anyone who works children . sadly , most adults no idea what school really like modern day children they need wake-up call . however , if like me you grew up abused , forgotten , lost alone . don't see it , it only dredge up painful memories things can't changed . this just my personal opinion , others may disagree feel we should ' face our demons ' , but i've dealt my issues see no point pouring salt old wounds	1

first off let me say this review vhs version movie . i hoping purchase dvd would correct problems evident vhs . it appears problems remained .. grateful all those reviewers who saved me buying just format same problems . it seems disney just copied film exactly like vhs nothing more . way , one great benefits amazon reviewing ... it hopefully prevents us wasting money . problem now how rate it .. 5 star movie 2 star format . perhaps it money issue disney ... they felt effort wasn't worth return . whatever reason it really corporate shame treat this movie so poorly . movie one those old disney family fares conveys magic disneyland when walt running show . it stars great peter ustinov who carries movie lights up screen his humor presence . he so many great lines pirate seafaring dialogue treat hear(no swearing ) . he plays off dean jones , who way great job himself college coach who unwittingly releases blackbeard limbo .. heaven hell . blackbeard now good deed set free his just reward ... ' help old lady across street ? that silly ! " . movie typical disney formulaic they try help blackbeard descendants save old boarding house . suzanne pleshette stars romantic interest several standard disney stock players fill rest . my favorite scene when ustinov jones lock arms head off take silky boys singing revised version " heart oak " joined pleshette .. " i'm not letting you go there alone " . no cgi here but lots physical comedy great performance ustinov . here hoping disney get their act together tranfers this movie widescreen .. getting aspect ratio right .. it deserves . even if nothing more than letting younger generation enjoy work great peter ustinov .	1

simply put , this movie rules . you've got james spader . you've got lori laughlin . you've got sean . cunningham directing , he not only produced house iv : home deadly home , he also produced last house left , directed some movie called friday 13th . but kicker , reason i really sought it out , novelist harry crews ' involvement . after some research , i've found it difficult determine exactly how much he script . he not credited , but thanked end credits . stephen gyllenhaal brian taggart get screenwriter nods , but old crews interview , he mentions , quot ; i wrote this script called new kidsquot ; ( but that all there interview , snippet posted his website ) . so who knows . actually , i'm sure there someone fatter uglier than me out there who knows , assuming person surely doesn't anything better , they should contact me more information . new kids nothing crews novels like quot ; feast snakesquot ; or quot ; carquot ; or quot ; knockout artist , quot ; all humorously grotesque ( sometimes stomach-churning ) portraits bizarro southern life , which makes his direct involvement even more suspect . but it better-than-expected genre picture . just look what you get ! 1 ) james spader speedo underwear . 2 ) james spader doing really bad , on-again-off-again southern accent . 3 ) james spader snorting cocaine his van while his gang cretins run around outside , dousing lori laughlin lighter fluid taunting her lit matches attempt get her submit good , southern-style gang rape . 4 ) some dude named shannon who plays character named loren . 5 ) death ferris wheel . 6 ) death bumper cars . 7 ) death house mirrors ( super-lame lady shanghai quot ; homagequot ;) . 8 ) death roller coaster . 9 ) lori laughlin shower scene where you clearly see , numerous times , her flesh-colored bikini hiding her wares filmmakers . 10 ) eric stoltz getting called quot ; faggot . quot ; still not convinced ? well , there nothing more i . if you require plot description , you're already internet , so why don't you take some initiative	1
strange intro , i know ... but musician guitar player ...

this insipid remake takes far too many liberties story , butchers its source material , unsurprisingly ends up quite mess . furthermore , movie doesn't even really make sense when you think it . protagonist this time wants travel past save his love , finds he can't alter what happened . he then goes future where he alter events . remake entirely forgets point eloi supposed human cattle . they're not kind entirely destroys whole point book , film greatly suffers result . character played jeremy irons dumb addition story . ironically , special effects used depict morlocks better 60s film	-1
i never liked dogs when i kid , mostly because i runt they could pretty much eat me whole . which didn't preclude me liking idea dogs , or loving this film way back when . nostalgia kick i bought it again expected aspect my childhood destroyed upon reminded how horrible some things i liked back then actually adult perspective ( few examples come mind , but least i won't contend liking few things tv nowadays definitely future adults cringing ... ) . surprise , it actually even more enjoyable now " adult " . it all good i remembered , or better . when i child i never percieved it particularly " dark " film so many claim it ... truthfully , thing stuck me over years songs . they really engaging well written , not squirm-fests populate most children films any era . while certain things stick out not acceptable today children pictures ( drinking , straightforwardness topics such gambling murder ) , i definitely don't think that attitude defines film . " clean up " this movie would suck life it , make it just like any more modern children film . i no qualms showing it my nieces nephews . i think it shame movies nowaday shelter younguns anything resembling reality . besides , core it great , touching story love friendship , i think that what shines through most kids , most adults upon watching film . anne marie absolutely adorable , charlie , voiced burt reynolds likeable scoundrel any . characters all dimensional believable , despite dogs . thing sticks out when viewing this film comparison more modern children offerings . it now seen , unfortunately , throwback when kids movies didn't need rely flashy graphics or super-hip characters settings entertaining . current studios could use dose this adventurousness	1
reading movies discription you should somewhat know what you getting into . it hard find this movie listed anywhere without word dark front comedy . dark generally means some unpleasant material covered movie . within this movie genre you also grosse pointe blank which goofy comedy should hardly construed dark schmidt which virtually no comedic value but dark . this isn't laugh minute comedy , most dark comedies aren't . it story starts out somewhat serious plausible meant funny shear absurdity remaining events . this violence , gore some disturbing moments . if you watch this movie idea it movie meant fun take very serious situation . cast great portray great characters . cameron diaz great crazed bride determined perfect wedding . it over top depiction bride-to-be who her wedding not it ruined any reason , but it funny standpoint . watch it more than once because second time around you'll more numb shock some scenes able enjoy parts supposed funny instead dwelling very bad things	1
i agree some reviewers here , this dvd needs upgrade . it too great funny not time investment make this dvd worthy film . however , until new dvd comes , i settle what i . this film discussed length , i would just like add if you never seen this film , yourself favor buy it . not rent it . buy it . it good . tim burton made classic ghost story [ he made many great films ] but this film where i first became really interested his work . film stars young ( geena davis ) ( alec baldwin ) husband wife who recently died . they don't know they dead first , but come realize they never survived their accident . however , they new people home they once occupied : they don't like it . ( jeffrey jones ) funny this film , his character his wife ( catherine o'hara ) delightfully funny . dark broody daughter portrayed ( winona ryder ) who befreinds two recently departed ghost . however , main character ' beetlejuice , ' who portrayed very funny ( michael keaton ) . he helps rid ghosts pesky intruders : but cost . film funny well worth purchase . highly recommended . [ stars : 5+	1
i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1
bert i . gordon masterpiece , " beginning end " features wooden peter graves waxing philosophic effects radiation locusts ( not grasshoppers ) , which grown varying sizes maurauding through oddly-mountainous illinois , dispatching entire towns . graves accompanied plucky female journalist ( briefly ) deaf-mute gardening assistant . add half-hearted special effects ( shot after shot locusts crawling up postcards buildings ) some leery directing ( opening car sequence takes forever end ; lascivious locust staring into apartment freshly showered woman towl ) , you've got your typical d-grade schlock . this one first episodes mike nelson season ( back dvd box features joel friendly mug ; don't fooled ) , such , there some hesitancy jokes , some ground feeling . opening host segment -- where mike receives bizarre phone call trailer trash mom who thinks he someone else -- sets great tone show , invention exchange ( " re-comfy-bike " new playing cards ) , but movie such dud riffs often repetitive rare . host segments inject bit life into dullness . one them though , deliberately non-funny stand-up routine tom , so deliberately non-funny it ... well , it really isn't funny , mirroring sad way status entire film . joke show hinges movies so bad they're funny , but every once while mst3k crew finds movie that so bad it , well , it nothing but bad . " beginning end " comes close ; after all , there only so many jokes made long , ponderous silences recycled dialogue/scenes . mike bots best they here , but end result just so-so . die-hard collectors only	1

i am appalled greed disney must milk out classic like " absent minded professer " . i found this one worst if not worst remake any movie . i found plot too embelished it made relationship characters played robin williams marsha gay-hayden one where it either tried remake safe easy happy ending that throughout all disney movies , or it showed one where parties wear their hearts out their sleeves . i also feel character " flubber " it waste time considering i don't remember any merchandising character . they should've stayed bouncing rubber balls original . i also feel promotion flubber substance it all shallow , commericial where original it going put good use military , here it make buck . i feel there some movies best just left original state , not remade , this one them .	-1

documentaries tupac shakur tricky business . one hand , he fascinating subject , other hand , filmmakers rarely get hold his music or interview important people needed tell full story . tupac music controlled his mother she hasn't sanctioned official documentary thus far . it only 5 years since tupac murder , most important parties associated him reluctant talk . " before i wake " makes valiant effort but hindered same things i mentioned previously . warning spoilers ahead : this film basically interview tupac bodyguard somehow stretched out into 90 minutes . film maker cannot use any 2pac music , his videos or concert fotage , so they rely still pictures they repeat over over again . credit must given editors though who use moody instrumental score , creepy sound effects dark visual style makes impression . essentially , " before i wake , " boils down brief bio tupac followed recap his legal problems . main focus documentary his murder 1996 . we get blow blow , often minute minute summary his final day before shooting . bodyguard interesting story tell . unfortunately , his story drags . which add some suspense but it gets overkill . like filmmaker teasing audience big revelation never comes . nutshell , film reveals tupac security detail messed up big time day vegas las vegas police terrible job investigating shooting . no big surprises there . nonetheless , " before i wake " indispensable document pac murder his troubled last years . film make you miss him terribly . wonder just why he seemed destined die young	1
i always fan batman tv series , this movie basically overlong episode minus cliff hanger . this movie not psychologically provoking like tim burton series . but it fun your whole family watch . it features cast tv series . only casting change lee meriwether catwoman instead julie newmar ( or eartha kitt ) . one last comment : this movie proposes possible solution tension nations . one may say it not realistic , but nothing else seems working	1

i rented this film immediatley after seeing first bride white hair hoping fluid entrancing continuation story . there perfect setup sequel i couldn't wait watch it unfold . after first half hour i knew director ronnie yu abandoned feel first film it seemed he didn't really give damn how interesting story . poor dialogue , inadequate story , there nothing satisfying or even interesting this film . if you enjoyed first bwwh you'll probably still tempted watch this movie just make sure you rent it before buying	-1
i didn't high expectations this movie , yet it still managed completely disappoint me . i adore robin williams , his performance best part movie . but script abysmal sara , played marcia gay harden , completely one dimensional character . antics sidekick robot " flubber " itself just plain embarrasing watch . too bad , because idea great - but frankly , original pretty bad too . they really could so much this story either first or second time around	-1
friday 13th , part - new beginning worst series so far saying allot . acting much worst then prior movies . script awfull like police academy parts 4 onwards level nothing short terrible . special effects looked cheap even time movie made budget like nothing close first couple movie . music outrageously bad probably some worst 80 music i ever heard . i love 80 hairdoes , tacky cheap looking clothes , make up atrocious . dialogue so bad one wonders if it highschool project gone awry . killing scenes also kind lame they seem run out ideas . movie only 92 minutes long but it sure feels it like least twice long plot makes no sense all . this movie no redeeming qualities should avoided all costs	1
back cover : miracles happen ! award-winning actress mary steenburgen ( tv joan arcadia , hope springs ) gives solid performance ginny grainger , young mother who rediscovers joy beauty christmas , thanks unshakeable faith her six-year-old daughter abbie ( elisabeth harnois ) gideon ( harry dean stanton ) , ginny very own guardian angel . ginny wonderous experience touch your heart warm your soul timeless tradition past disney favorites . one magic christmas fulfills all your most treasured christmas fantasies . share it those you love . my review:i'm such sucker christmas stuff . i probably own more christmas books movies than regular ones . so this review not " bah humbug ! " scrooge . i don't expect all my christmas films " happy happy joy joy " all time . my absolute favorite all time it wonderful life , which very dark places . first off , i don't think acting bad this movie . cinematography pretty good well . i made my judgment based content storyline , which , my opinion , flopped . what i really found annoying way ginny , heroine , constantly villified . example , let me paint you picture her life : her husband laid off hasn't worked six months . they two young children . she making minimum wage , they're barely scraping . they've also evicted their home ( since it owned her husband previous employer ) forced move her father-in-law . they very little saved bank , yet her husband wants take out $500 buy christmas presents kids . she understandably balks idea . first all $500 way too much spend presents just two kids , even if you're rich . unless you want your kids become spoiled ! ( remember , this movie originally made 1985 , so number even more outrageous . plus , they only one meager paycheck live no house their own . i think she reasonable . but she painted bad guy not blowing bunch their savings toys . then her husband wants sink what little money they into his own bike shop , possibly go into debt own his own business . again , she villified only responsible one , telling her husband he needs get steady job steady paycheck . after all , they may need their savings survive . this not time blowing it dreams may never pan out ( usually don't , since most small businesses fail first year ) . but no , she shown mean , cold-hearted witch saying this . grr . it just so irritating . yes , you want give your kids magical christmas , yes , husband always dreamed owning his own shop , but you responsible , especially when you children feed clothe . i don't think she scrooge wanting responsible adult ( she buy her kids resonably priced gifts , after all ) , but film painted her such . this film so depressing . it felt like world constantly kicking this family while it down . happy ending long time coming . also , i'd very hesitant show this movie impressionable young children . i certainly wouldn't want one my children think they constantly disobey me , run away home middle night , or talk creepy-looking strangers trench coats . that how kids end up abducted or killed ! not really realistic . i really expected better disney , especially when i really loved one their other christmas movies , santa clause . there way better christmas movies out there . see my list " christmas movies i watch every year " movies worth your time money . i don't recommend one magic christmas . if you're still determined watch it , try rent it first , or you might find yourself upset you wasted your money , like i .	1

sure , first tmnt film classic , but i've always prefered tmnt ii , it one my favorite movies my childhood . it coolest/greatest opening sequence out all tmnt movies , foot soldiers , paige turco april , most all , super shredder ! let not forget vanilla ice " out nowhere " performance himself , performing " ninja rap " . what more could young tmnt fan ask ( especially early-to-mid 1990's!) ? this film , turtles find substance made them mutate into humanoids , they find out where it came . shredder finds out it well , he uses it become super shredder , well create two monsters defeat turtles , rahzar tokka ! so , basically turtles recover ooze , defeat shredder his monsters . sure , film seems " sooooo 90 " . sure , tmnt fad my childhood over . however , this film holds up well , first film . today , i'd consider this great b-movie , or even guilty pleasure . if you fan tmnt during late 80's/early 90 , check this out if you haven't already ! oh , yourself favor avoiding third tmnt film . it atrocious	1

i watched hollywood action film , theater , day before i watched this dvd . what difference . i'm not saying there no place die hard or kung fu hustle or movie like . but people who've only seen sort movie should see power slow accretion details precisely added way bresson tells story man escaped . lack extraneous entertainment perfect presentation main story forces viewers appreciate building drama . i wonder if constant visual distractions some films aren't because director knows he can't what bresson . tension fantastic time fontaine escape it tremendously moving when he succeeds .	1

it fun watch first episode scooby doo ( high rise hair raiser ) my computer download my kids . we go back watch it time time . i am glad amazon gave me this free download , so i could try this feature	1
after reading all these 5 star reviews i confident i myself some real , sick , perversely arousing my macabe taste this over-priced movie such bore i didn't finish it . maybe when it got good , but i doubt it . there lot human waste shots , but , it obviously fake , " torchered " youths seem enjoying themselves , there no attempt penitration , no terror , no reckless tastelessness . i don't get it i guess , i literally bored sleep .	-1
first all , i would like start off saying this movie sucks . here few things supports my decision . 1 . dacascos not know capoeira . he played berimbau ( insrument used capoeira ) wrong , he pronouced many terms incorrectly , he no flow his movements . 2 . acting horrible . while watching this , you kind get picture director wanted finish this movie soon possible . most lines just stupid . dacascos character no real history . apparently this mysterious past you really could care less because plot so predictable . 3 . fighting laughable best . capoeira only martial art outlawed so violent unstoppable . you don't need corny fight scenes show it usefulness . most fight scenes where repeated movements shot different angles . dacascos doing meia lua ( spinning kick which both hands ground you strike ) knocking out three people once . one ridiculous scene , saverio ( drug lord ) pointed where he wanted dacascos stand so he could miraculously appear behind him perform unchallenged jumping kick back his head . i wish experinced capoeirista would fight scenes . although this movie horrible , it only movie which capoeira suppose main artform used . while watching this movie , one only hope this poor performance dosen't hurt capoeira chances cornerstone movie .	1
most fundamental level , i.e. , sexual/semi-erotic level , l'ennui most definitely its moments . total film , however , it stutters more than few times . technically , subtitles occasionally flash too fast or offered no contrast so they become almost unreadable . camerawork quite good , however , definite european style . story itself also intriguing , but once point made , it nowhere go . problems begin actors plot . not actors bad ; they actually very good . but you understand minute one martin isn't wrapped too tightly ( his treatment fan , example , early ) , so his bizarre behavior once he meets cecelia isn't surprising least . more simply , guy evinces no sympathy least viewer ; none . he complete ass . he comes off needy , selfish egomaniacial , one those boors who so deeply personally insecure they become outwardly obnoxious nasty hide it everyone . you really don't care what ultimately happens him , also understand if he get what he wanted film , he would immediately reject it once he , just hurtful . cecilia , more you get know her , just bad way . she doesn't come off stupid ( someone else said)or obtuse , but almost totally uncaring unfeeling , not mention far more immature than her few years . she simply whatever she wants whenever she without lot regard how it hurt or affect people . she understands how they feel things , but unless it touches her directly negatively , doesn't really care . look how she regarded her father . all all , it hard feel sympathy her well . she not opaque but almost completely transparent . say film point hammered home way too long or ending ridiculously abrupt putting it mildly .	1
this good movie watch whole family . it may also spark some interest baseball those not already interested . all all movie entertaining , realistic believable far families emotions concerned	1
" prom night " my favorite early slashers . i love disco soundtrack whole late 70 feel movie . ever since i saw halloween i craved more jamie lee curtis this gives you healthy dose . plot pretty usual but killer wasn't predictable like lot slasher movies . it horror/slasher classic , not much gore but still effective . i say woman i would never take ride fat boy van ~ !! jude ~ ! what you feelin girl ? 70 80 slashers jocks usually didn't any musclesbut girls always big [ ... ] . go figure . anyway .. buy movie it slasher royalty .	1

this probably best hoffman video . domingo his peak here , best hoffman i've ever heard singing best i've heard him sing role . particularily good ballad klinzach " amis ! l'amour tendre " , which acted excellently domingo features some really great buisness anges balsta , domingo chorus . conducting pretre speedy , most time it works , but , some places ( like baracolle , sung beautifully ) it seems singes hardly keep up . production values nothing short increadable . late john schliesinger shows himself capable operatic director , several nice touches production , such lindorf appearing end each act , mocking hoffman laughing . i would prefered see roles acted one man , but seperate apperances lindorf just well . begining venice act very impressive , gondolas floating ominously writhing orgy taking place banks cannal . designs maria bjornson willum dudley utilize three-story stage excellently , give each setting different feel : tavern place grity reality , paris zany victorian invetors lab , venice c.b. demille nightmare , munic feeling derilict , clostrophobic mansion hell . singing , other than domingo almost uniformally good . luciana serra , olympia fine acting-wise her voice pleasent enough , but i don't like her phrasing . balsta guiletta increadeble , real stand out . she looks terrific , too . ileana cortubas ' antonia sings well enough , but could act part better . still , you warm up her eventually , she very good final trio . villians , robert llyod ( asways reliable ) memerable lindorf , though he speaks rather than sings stella letter takes his aria much fast . sir geraint evans amazing coppelius , both zany extreamly creepy . seigmund nimsgern extreamly hypotic dappertutto , gives best vocal performance out four villians . nicolai ghiuselev miracle production biggest letdown , he overpowered his two trios easily acts rather woodenly . claire powell excellent masculine nicklausse , makes ravishing transformation into muse , where her sdialouge not good . smaller roles , robert tear memerable spalanzani gwynne howell excellent touching crespel . bernard dikerson very funny frantz , giving best acting performance ( if not vocal ) " jour et nuite " i've heard yet . paul crook execellent conchinelle , but not andres . chorus orchestral work both excellen t.t his production i would highly recomend under any circumstances	1
i pleasantly surprised this film . i happened catch it israeli television while tel aviv business . nothing better i left it , fully expecting treated one half hour festival hedonism celebration hedonism . what i found instead hedonism but additionally honest portrayal consequences lifestyle . it amazes me some people who give this film one , two , or three stars criticize it its hedonism completely totally fail recognize film anything but celebration it . if anything it warning young people life lived service self often lead pain , anguish even death	1
this movie not well theaters , it got bad reviews , even leguizamo apologized it . i don't care : this one funniest movies ever ! it jeffrey jones , guy " howard duck " " ferris bueller day off . " now you know film hilariously corny if he it . great thing this movie how leguizamo acts like live , human version bugs bunny . this type slapstick rarely seen modern films . further , leguizamo mocks all people who think race solely blackwhite terms his ethnic drag all cultures . too funny . " latinus s___ticus " gag rollover funny ! i hated homophobia how gayness rendered white only ( if miami doesn't many latino , black , asian gay men ) , but still this movie great	1

disney released certain evidence new " masterpiece edition " this timeless classic should expected somewhere 2007 , whether it single or 2-disc edition not known yet , but " masterpiece edition " likes 2004 alice wonderland dvd re-release , it quite possible rescuers too see two disc set ! i'm so excited , i can't wait , it well time . like i said , don't waste your money this poor standard edition , print looks horrible , colors dark , murky unbalanced , nothing like they supposed look like sound nothing extravagant . 2007	1
i child insomnia when i first caught this movie channel 56 late night , horrified see my president shoot man i wanted this gorgeous sleepy-eyed girl . recently , again , i wanted see this movie order watch ronald reagan villain especially satisfied because this late his acting career so he looked much like he looked time he became president , so it interesting hear him say stuff like quot ; i believe larceny , but i don't condone murder . quot ; he stiff criminal who can't even satisfy his girl , orders cronies most his dirty work , ... ( no i'm talking character , though i suppose you might think not ) . furthermore , angie dickinson absoloutely gorgeous this fact kept me ! why she not famous marylin monroe , etc .?? her sleepyish eyes , her body , whew . plus lee marvin great , film interesting , shot some neat angles which add quot ; weirdnessquot ; it . something like watered down hitchcock film , almost . i recommend movie fully , but it almost nothing hemingway short story it supposedly based upon	1
" no way out " applauded tackling subject racial tension time when it probably wasn't fashionable or commercially viable . said , despite moments searing truths , film only treats it subject matter superficially . my mind it never gets root causes institutionalized racism . makers seem slough it off class resentment blacks white underclass who depicted here wild eyed yahoos , none worse than over-the-top richard widmark . never mind real power wielded elites like industrialists , medical profession , film industry . despite these quibbles there alot recommend here , not least all towering performance young sidney poitier intern caught middle racial maelstrom . despite his youth , poitier radiant screen presence much evidence here suggests greater work yet come him	1

this film tells powerful story , " crime punishment " -esque recovery soul , except without ending dostoevsky his novel . after neel auguste committs murder , madame la ( juliette binoche ) , much like dostoevsky sonya , takes monumental task recovering lost soul succeeds . those who suggest this film unrealistic no grasp eternal , christian values compassion those who call this film ideological propaganda no appreciation beauty , acting ( all three , especially kusturica auteuil , whom i discovered through this film who almost eclipse talented binoche ) , cinematography , directing absolutely brillian t.t his must-watch many different kinds people , those interested st. pierre miquelon ( i look up islands map surprised learn they french , not canadian ) , those who would like illustration why there never soul , lost forever , those who would just like receive aesthetic pleasure beautiful film . finally , some commented character neel auguste , saying he " retarded " not running away . not let comment like fool you . it would not made reviewer understood character or even picked up direct quote madame la , " you so fatalistic !

i seen many historical war dramas far east ( mainly china ) most them not only historically inaccurate but strong bias toward enemy . yi soon shin , however , rare exception . not only drama very historically accurate but it also very comprehensive detailing meticulous battle planning admiral leads each victory but also political in-fighting chosun political factions ( second-guessing nature king ) which causes his eventual death . also , special effects great . battle scenes ( whether sea or land ) realisitic outstanding quality . only problem i find dvd not placed sufficient focus contribution ming china . then again , this not unexpected since this korean drama focusing great admiral . also , entire selection should 104 episodes . i don't know why it stops 101 . if you want more comprehensive knowledge subject , try samuel hawley imjin war ( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately quoting original sources ) . any who only intered fighting may also want check out stephen turnbull samurai invasion ( which more colorful maps detailed description battles japanese perspective ) . lastly , anyone who fan samurai warfare may want check out shogun : total war creative assembly ( now gold version ) .	1
this movie i think people either like lot or dislike lot . i've seen it twice movie houses now three times dvd . it cool film , decadent core only one really likeable character , 14 year old boy . i'm one those who like it lo t.t he boy brought shanghai ( 1930s ) his gangster uncle work " family " powerful , aging drug boss . drug lord mistress , nightclub singer , played gong li . boy assigned fetch carry her . gong li plays her willful , beautiful , selfish perhaps overly confident courtesan . gong li sings dances several times star nightclub , she wonderful part . nearly everything seen perspective boy -- which means you don't get full picture any one time . there brutal gang attack boss his key henchmen , his mistress boy flee isolated fog-bound island regroup plot . there betrayal merciless , calculated revenge , practical killing . ending , needless say , not pleasant ... except , perhaps , boss . boy , least , survives . film gorgeous look beautifully lit photographed . dvd transfer excellent	1

see this comedy classic 43 years later revelatory . many reviewers here find this introduction bumbling inspector clousseau , extended pursuit jewel thief , too slow . pity , but entirely understandable . even those who remember 60s , since then , conditioned speed-up all entertainment , especially film . subtracting fame pink panther series sellers , whom this break-out movie , many younger persons just puzzled . bottom line comedy here much closer chaplin than us , now . world changed fast also give edge sadness watching movie some us . what triumphs , however , innocence , charm , visual beauty . international sets lovely starlets sort thing added pizz-azz time , but if we more jaded all now , beauty remains beauty . then too , always professional david niven delivers necessary ground let sellers ' gags -- invariably physical dumb -- develop . where sellers got his facial expressions god knows ; man inspired , inimitable , gift . 65% what he comes silent film era ; rest marvelously tuned comic pitch his voice , perfect any situation . so sure , what would take 15 minutes screen now extended 2 hours . what funny , then , you see ; it acquired taste today . comedy , unlike tragedy , very particular time place . almost any shakespeare tragedy pumped up re-mounted modern audience ; he wrote many comedies but only very top ones , such midsummer night dream , redone any era . film , so accurate unflinching , really press issue this ephemeral nature comedy . so why see it ? peter sellers . david niven . capucine young claudia cardinale , young robert wagner . they here , preserved fresh day this deceptively low key comedy shot . what would we give 5 minute clip , even silent , great 18th century shakespearean actor david garrick ? priceless amount , course . film such this asks appreciated sort homely , poignant light	1
this movie really great . i loved it !! i won't give away any it because it would probably give away too much . go see it !!!!!!!!!!! it great funny !!!!!! definetly must see !!	1
war flicks go , this one pretty decent ; no overdramatic , sappy acting , cast playing belle crew pretty cohesive , just like you would expect . most part , film reasonably realistic ( i've known lots b-17 b-24 pilots ) . it impressed me they even got belle model ( b-17f ) right ; i didn't know there any flying f still around , most g-models . there some inaccuracies though . why they glamorize belle name nose , when it actually made up plain block letters ? " little friends " ( fighter escort ) would not made up p-51 early 1943 , more than likely p-47s ; i forgive this one because there only couple flyable " jugs " left . belle 25th mission actually " milk run " over france ; they fly once over bremen but i believe around their 20th mission . smoking not allowed , or anywhere near , bombers . i could list several other things , but you get my point . still , it one better bomber movies many ways . i would agree reviewer though " twelve o'clock high " . it doesn't much action this movie , but totally accurate much more dramatic	1
i used like this film back late 80s but after purchasing it , reading book watching it again i realized there isn't much say redeeming this film . sure it low budget , but story characters so cheesy not good movie way . i guess this film still it fans but after reading book ( i dont normally compare books films because its downright impossible compare ) i found characters just not likeable ending very ridiculous . film achieve cult status isn't too hard if its movie but whether its good film or not real question . me i rate this low because i find it atrocious but it fans , ones out there really love this film call it " classic " i must say i hope some day they remake story better actors , effects plotting	-1

i thought this might only interest science enthusiasts or real film buffs , but acting chemistry greer garson ( mrs. miniver ) walter pidgeon ( forbidden planet ) really make science romantic . there other stars supporting cast , they all great job bringing this slice science history life , including robert walker ( strangers train ) , van johnson ( 30 seconds over tokyo ) , henry travers ( it wonderful life ) , . aubrey smith ( beyond tomorrow , five came back ) , margaret o'brien ( meet me st. louis ) . my favorite movies this type edison man spencer tracy , young tom edison mickey rooney ; but sheer quantity raw talent makes madame curie just good those favorites	1

i never smiled sooo much through ' mystery film ' . this very cool movie . many labeled it " artsy " movie , my artsy usually means abstract or undefined . this movie straight forward , guy dead begining movie detective trying find out who killed him or if it suicide . very basic , but what not basic suspects / witnesses . each one living his own world , you mentaly challenged , [ ... ] artiest , one who thinks he 5th beatle . so enjoyment seeing how detective * who just strange other charecters * tries get information out them . so you get little romance , alot smiles through this experiance . i personally enjoyed it , espcially fact you hear bono singing almost throught whole movie :d why i give it 4 not 5 stars ? i not too happy extra features , they not title anyone when they speaking , so if you don't know names actors , producers ect .. then your out luck . also audio extra features bit unstable , low high depeding who interviewed .. i very disapointed not find least one music video movie bono , there songs movie bono written movie , it would helped if they actually interviewed bono , since he co-writter film give us more insight inspiration this project . other than , it very cool movie , very believeable cast , i mean you actually believe this guys nuts , its fantastic . murder/thriller , it actually dosen't much violence or blood it ... but alot smiles	1

there something fact this vampire uses or needs airplane fly around place place just takes away any horror this film could really create . stephen king " night flier " very poor plot even poorer cast characters . shame you stephen king !! moreover , there not one character entire movie you relate or even sympathize slightest . movie centers around selfish crass newspaper reporter who trying track serial killer who flies his plane airport airport search victims . it becomes increasingly apparent this serial killer not human . now , only reason this film not get 1 star rating vampire rather horrifying looking ending slightly creepy , but everything else this movie fails evoke any interest me whatsoever . if you really want see good vampire flick , you should watch original " salem lot " , directed tobe hooper ( not " new " garbage came out recently tnt ) , which one , if not scariest movie all-time . quite frank , i'm reluctant give " night flier " even 2 stars , but , i said above , there couple creepy/scary elements it . if you see it tv , you should check it out yourself , but it not worth penny me .	1

' phantom ' released ' 96 my all-time favorite comic book superhero film . billy zane perfect phantom just everything else this movie . this not special effects extravaganza like most movies this genre though it few . it however everything good movie should , strong script cohesive storyline , great cinematography , excellent ensemble cast hero you'll love cheer ! cast includes ; treat williams , kristy swanson , catherine zeta jones patrick mcgowan . i wish they made sequel . my highest recommendation	1
before he helped craft fodder like gone 60 seconds remake swordfish , dominic sena directed this slick looking psycho thriller , featuring wonderfully twisted performance brad pitt , who verge becoming household name . pre-x-files david duchovny stars budding author who , his photographer girlfriend ( michelle forbes ) , make trek west coast advertise riding partners . what they get white-trash sociopath early ( pitt ) his whacko girlfriend ( juliette lewis ) , soon enough terrifying trip begins slowly escalates point no return . though it narrative something we've seen before again , kalifornia more than worth seeing thanks pitt psycho performance , which showcases he indeed unique versatility actor , which shown spades here . if there any real weak point , it duchovny comes off rather drab , but what else would he ? all all , if you dig films like natural born killers or anything tarantino , you'll most likely want take trip kalifornia	1
oscar winner roger avary ( creator " gold watch " segment pulp fiction ) directed this adaptation novel bret easton ellis like avary directorial debut " killing zoe " , this movie highly original good but lags some parts isn't really movie i'd watch again . don't get me wrong , i'm happy i watched it ; avary talented film maker , but ... movie college kids doing exactly what college kids . means get drunk , get high , get laid . every one our characters this pretty much throughout entire movie . one keys this movie success it cinematography film editing , both which oscar worthy . scenes reverse thing great . but , we meet all characters party they ; sean bateman ( james van der beek , who very far away his former creek ) , senior college drug dealer who desparate win over lauren ( shannyn sossamon ) when all while he recieves love notes his p.o. box . lauren virgin , whom we meet she loses her virginity , who wants win over victor ( kip pardue ) . then there paul denton ( ian somerhalder ) who gay desparately wants sean . also involved this triangle lauren slutty roommate lara ( jessica biel , who middle trying shed her " 7th heaven " image ) . movie weaves through events transpire their lives eventually bring them back each other very skillfully . ending , which ends abruptly movie stars , really good . one thing i've noticed while watching avary movies , dialouge his strong suit . both this movie " killing zoe " dialouge very smart quick witted . also both movies , story lag . but , this pretty good movie it worth renting . dialouge : b+movie : b-overall grade :	1

i say i surprised when i first saw this . this why bridget fonda used big star . there no reason she should able kill like 20 people restaurant , yet she sells it so well , she could killed 100 . if you not seen french movie le femme nikita , don't worry , this almost good . beign action fan , i liked it even more . story gets little stupid couple points , but those minor becsue movie so freaking good . i don't wanna give nothing away cause it easy follow i promise you enjoy it least one time through . but i say fonda sheeit , harvy keitel awesome playing jean reno role , sadisticly i might add . gabriel byrne best part me , writer didn't come up greatest dialogue but gabriel just man , he turn any role into fittign himself . so awesome movie doesn't any special features . anyone know fo special edition coming out	1
like review i just read , tarkovskies ' andre rublev movie i keep coming back over years . it my favorite film until something special comes . more than any filmmaker any country , any language , this movie imparted impressed it viewpoint into my perception . i incorporated it into my vision . i resonate it ... it plays me like bell . it not entertainment really though much it entertaining . this film transcends both entertainment mere artistic success - images themes so spiritually charged archetypically strong one may sense while watching it , he or she remembering half forgotten dreams . like person whose review i just read , i often pause simple wonder after chapter just let it ring . film chronicles life spiritual development russian artist , icon painter andre rublev . epic unfolds 6 chapters last which introduces artist , young church bell maker . chapter reveals aspects components creative process both literally allegory ... one senses filmmaker tarkovsy young bell-maker may great deal common he may written himself into this section .... this last chapter " spring " shot through narrative vitality , energetic quality expression simply colossal - there joy unfolding discovery this bell-makers own creative powers ... all which witnessed aging jaded andre rublev who , witness , transformed what he sees , anyone who eyes see apprehend naked wonder this last chapter . andre tarkovsky made this film what used ussr during period rigid scrutinizing censorship . he used artistic restraints hoops he jump through brilliant advantage carefully codifying individual artistic spiritual themes into chapters this epic . constraints seem served discipline streamline narrative ... result golden ... more truth per foot film than any i compare it . i saw it first video college russian art history class , later bought dvd , more recently attended screening disney studios colleague given invite but couldn't make . i brought someone who just didn't get it . tarkovsy not everyone though you should give yourself benefit doubt because , if he you , you may very well changed touched rewarded again again this truly timeless gem	1

yep , like many viewers i watched this when i too young scared like weeks end couldnt get tall man image out my head . well , when this got re-released i just " " it figuring it would bring back memories really allow me get into once again . unfortunately because i am now older hopefully little wiser , film ends up rather cheesey horror movie mix-mash plot no tension or scary moments whatsoever . hey , i wasnt looking dustin hoffman like performance horror movie but geeez acting pretty rough forced . plot started off pretty cool but then began not know what itself got almost silly towards end . mausoleum itself eerie but dwarf guys ( star wars jawas ? ) pretty funny whole thing just didnt add up . always horror films quick call police all it would taken stop this tall man , but no .... lets grab trusty shotgun take care it ourselves ...... c'mon . scene plastic bug jacket made me laugh outloud i rewound it just get laugh . film makers know how silly this looked .... didnt they ? i hope scene supposed tongue-in-cheek or film makers need rethink their film careers . course , thought process characters just didnt make any logical sense . i wont go into details , you'll see what i mean when you watch movie . oh yeah , mustard-covered fingers also classic laugh momen t.t he silver fyling ball still cool hell alone earned movie extra star rating me . i like jody , he tries right things most part waaaay cool ' cuda he drives around . little mike just young kid you almost felt bad him losing so many people he cared .... it tough . however , doesnt excuse inherent silliness movie or plot just doesnt unfold correctly or logically . maybe i expected too much , maybe i've become overly-critical movie watcher , but nontheless , i cant recommend this other than quick watch . rent it , dont buy it since it really zero redeeming qualities or multiple-viewing value . this could soooooo much better proper direction little more time put into films flow . it great concept horror . sci-fi thrown mystical elements well . great starting point it refershingly different opposed usual " 10 kids go camping get hacked ax murderer " [ ... ] you always see . again though .... it not polished all just didnt work well enough . sorry if i've burst proverbial bubble movies fans . but , its " cult " classic reason . much like rocky-horror picture show , event real attraction fans ... movie itself horrible pointless but fans dont want face fact so they hide behind " cult classic " label . hey , whatever .... :) way : dvd quality only average . i expected better transfer but my plasma based home theater , it pretty grainy not up par what re-release should , imo .

lawn dogs surprisingly original exceptionally well independent film . mischa barton devon amazing . her face pliable ultra expressive , even though she strangest little 10 year old captured film , her adult mannerisms dialogue show us little girl who treated like china doll her parents ; she rough life heart problems , which she explains dippety dit , etc . she wants show she still person quite capable doing things her parents trying spare her . sam rockwell equally effective " poor white trash " who mows rich people lawns , put upon young man , surprised his friendship this odd little girl . when watching film , though , watch subtle portraits painted : when devon wants give trent glass water , she reaches one better glasses whereupon her mother tells her there glass him under sink --- when trent takes devon meet his parents , mother offers them iced tea -- her best glasses ; when trent interrupts barbecue devon house , daddy offers him couple hot dogs while rest guests eating steak baked potatoes ; when community fancy lantern shades stolen , they blame trent , when it really nasty little boy who doing this ; when cds stolen golden boys ' car , it trent who blamed , when again , it our little cowboy/indian/monster . supporting performances very good : kathleen quinlan , devon mom , who messing around one golden boys ; christopher mcdonald her dad , lost political workings development ; eric mabius one golden boys obviously interested rockwell body well . there no real dramatic big scenes it leisurely film , but barton rockwell remarkable movie sense realism counteract fantasy elements	1

this sorry excuse comedy which i am sure inspired whole generation young teenagers start experimenting marijuana . no doubt couple years some them would overdosed heroin but fact seems conveniently overlooked makers this piece junk . any movie which " glorifies " drug use not cool cheech chong aren't even very likeable this movie . it also interesting note stacey keach plays drug policeman this movie then real life he busted possesion drugs which seriously damaged his career only goes show real life lot more serious than movies . how earth tommy chong ever managed produce beautiful off spring such rae dawn chong totally beyond my comprehension . i give this movie 5 stars because i get feeling it just might funny if you dumb enough ingest some illicit substances before watching it . however this not enough good reason me recommend it	1
this movie great several ways - all audrey hepburn fans would love it . she shows her talent more than just beautiful face . it also front runner , because it shows artistry great filmmaker , who build suspense tension merely use light , staging , without resorting cheap tricks excessive violence . film use light shadow amazing . timing characters exits entrances like watching finely tuned play . ( this play actually . ) this one you edge your chair . famous ending scene take your breath away every time , even if you've seen it before ! when suzy husband finally gets home realizes what happened , his reaction lame - they should rewritten one . but only 2 minutes , so don't let keep you watching this one . rent this movie your teens who like suspense thrillers - they enjoy it .	1
story conventional , idea isn't new ( it remake , fact ) , but true victory this film lies creative power talent behind it . george cukor behind camera , judy garland front it , moss hart penning words ; one could hardly go wrong . mix it dazzling performances lead supporting characters , plus magnetic pull judy garland mere presence , you've got yourself instant classic . film opens all glitz glamour hollywood provides , annual benefit academy . ester blodgett performs number her band suddenly interrupted when drunk superstar norman maine staggers onto stage . ester makes most situation comically incorporates him into her act so audience wouldn't suspect he drunk . this opening song shows sheer performance power judy garland makes it clear why she labeled " world greatest entertainer . " norman quickly seeks her out pushes her pursue bigger dream her remarkable dream , soon she huge star , eclipsing his own . his alcoholism bitterness , not towards ester but industry , soon gets better him . ester norman , meanwhile , fallen irrevocably love , it strength this connection much plot centers around . garland innate vulnerability , she so often described , so fitting this character i found myself moist eyeballs many time throughout film ( i'll concede my eyeballs loathe get least bit wet ) . her quavering voice large dewy eyes ring up host emotions makes you wonder how heck academy could overlooked this performance . musical numbers this picture also memorable , most important which " man got away . " judy garland doesn't look like she singing camera , but herself herself alone . audience almost feels moment too private intrude upon . but we quickly forget we're frozen , riveted garland magic . " born trunk " sequence elaborate looks like it took quite bit green . i must say it pleasure see garland perform " swanee " stage , complete dancers singers . one those ' little jabs pleasure ' norman maine would say . oftentimes when creative heavyweights mixed together venture , end result not miraculous . ' star born ' however , none voodoo . it sensational artistic achievement every department .	1

read tons books articles subject evolution i understand this film very much . i know some who understand evolution far less well certainly confused intricate plot concerning big . other complaints amazon reviewers i'll say this : 1 ) i find acting this film anything but hollywood-like . this film reminds me lot fatal attraction other rather realistic 80 hit films . this movie very realistic acting . 2 ) dialogue this movie profanity true --- but it delivered very sophisticated , educated , realistic way . not cheap like 80 rambo movies . realize most characters professors doctors such therefore it extra-cerebral dialogue . 3 ) blair brown much sexier than william hurt . 4 ) hurt character big scene goes back beginning mankind discovers how without love , little anger , happiness otheremotions life unbeliavably drab , indifferent purely technicality . that why he quits search . why so many insist it cheap ending ? 5 ) hurt character quits happily embracing earlier stages mankind upon realizing man not actually , ultimately god just single cell there no feeling all , no control , etc people . people better off their current , multi-celled state . therefore he successfully fights all regressions off end ( power he really all ) because it no good this realization makes him appreciate his loving sexy wife all more . 6 ) hurt character goes mexico --- not south america like some posters think	1

no this isn't courtney friends , but once you get past - this must watch tv ! while show content shocking , it so well written edited it all fits . it definitely sequential drama makes much more sense watching episodes back back . fleshes out characters so you start care understand them . courtney shows her acting chops best those moments when she silent lets her expressions say it all because sometimes her dialog bit stilted . best character functional schizophrenic photographer , don konkey . he exhibits endearing combination weirdness , loyalty , insight sweetness become break-out star this series . if you only watched one episode wrote this one off - go back watch few back back you may just find yourself addicted .	1

it takes hbcu graduate write hbcu experience , period . just look " different world " how bad first season . debbie allen ( howard grad , i believe ) stepped gave show authenticity it sorely needed . so it no surprise spike lee , morehouse man , would make movie sparked so much emotion both sides coin . i'm not saying you attend hbcu understand " school daze " , but you attended one get real " flavor " what it like . you open mind . any hbcu alum saying this film wasn't realistic flat-out lying . yes , it hit some things old folks call " dirty laundry " ( such hazing , color issues , those who think getting education makes you " white " , so ) , but those things real hbcus - yes , even today . ( major props spike one dark-skinned sista gamma rays . isn't always way ? ) there no " good " people or bad people ; spike leaves decision up you . julian his good points ( his intelligence , leadership pride his town , school , etc ) dap his bad points ( his blatant bigotry bullying ) , both them legitimate points . one thing spike nailed right confrontations students tended regular basis . no offense whites or anyone who graduated pwc , but my experience predominately white high school , i noticed students there lot more subtle their dislike ; they particpated more " destroying within " kind system , grew wide-eyed offended when confronted , even solid proof .

this movie lavished praise when it first came out , but after number viewings over years i find its intense mysteriousness less less appealing . holly hunter plays ada , mail-order bride who goes remote new zealand meet her husband ( played sam neill ) . we learn choice she not spoken since age six , though why never disclosed ; indeed , point made she doesn't know why , either . her one solace piano , which she plays well . but neill refuses instrument brought his home man , george baines ( played harvey keitel ) , uneducated , but morally decent , takes piano lets her play it his place . but he wants something her return - sexual favors . gradually they fall love movie end gone off together , sans piano , which they thrown into ocean . there lot unanswered questions raised : why ada voluntarily mute ? why she so repulsed her husband ? why she fall baines ? - fact these mysteries linger after credits roll annoying . main theme seems revolve around love triangle , but devoid purpose . heroine , hunter more freak social outcast . movie poetic sensual , but expense all reason . piano itself interesting symbol lots implications , but wildly lush settings extremely odd behavior principal characters overshadow its significance . although quite eyeful ( earful ) , movie leaves too many important questions unanswered	1

`beyond borders ' starts off brilliantly , it continues down turf quite sometime before veering off beaten path heading straight into generic hollywood fluff . prose established outset young socialite named sarah jordan ( jolie ) who her eyes mind opened relief worker named nick callahan ( owen ) caught my attention , most part film initially played out like coming age film woman who unaware horrors others face became determined help everyway she could . me angelina made this character part her , since i truly believe this character part her , thus made sarah very believable person . sarah married henry bauford ( roache ) but their marriage falling apart years . they mostly stay together sake their son jimmy . sarah since her initial visit ethiopia become member un , when nick his partner elliott ( emmerich ) need supplies sent them cambodia she takes this opportunity escape her philandering husband venture off this country help those need . it while there she realizes her attraction or love nick two them begin struggle thought their future since sarah son needs her family where nick so attached his work normal life something he'll never . much i not looking forward romantic nor dare i say tragic love story i alright sudden change pace when these two star crossed lovers began switch focus dying children each other . what threw me sudden shift into action adventure thriller when nick hot head gets him kidnapped sarah rushes out chechnya save him . me this movie would better served if it kept its focus its humanitarian side left action out it somewhat robs movie its dramatic nature turns it into generic hollywood blockbuster , which my opinion it shouldn't . `beyond borders ' lot important things say , if it kept focus those important matters then outcome would better film , but instead it feels too compelled add romance add adventure make it appealing every audience it loses audience would normally embrace it . i say acting all fronts elevates this film delivers bit realism . every tear angelina jolie clive owen shed feel real genuine . nothing feels forced or out character . some said they feel angelina miscast , i admit end when she goes her humanitarian care giver lara croft tomb raider i felt she stepped out character created new one , she still every bit convincing . i just feel this movie forgot what it trying prove allowed pressure box office blockbuster , draw large crowd , cloud their judgment caused them sabotage what could dynamic film . said i still very impressed most likely enjoy this film again ; i'm just disappointed such brilliant original start i would liked see less generic more focused ending	1
seen " stormy monday " many years ago , i completely enchanted this small interesting picture . nowadays , it commonplace every self-aware " cool " british crime drama embraced american audiences . but 1988 , this stylish film mike figgis bit more unorthodox . where else you get sean bean , sting , tommy lee jones , melanie griffith together ? it such weird amalgamation acting styles , yet somehow it works . this , i suppose , gangster flick heart . but what i like " stormy monday " familiar crime elements downplayed . there action when needed , some brutality -- but you've also got credible romance , peak polish subculture , commentary american commercialism , loving tribute jazz . music plays just great role setting tone " stormy monday " plot . it cool leisurely picture flows over you comfortable waves . this movie doesn't try too hard , it not designed your face--it subtle smart . sean bean great lead . bean someone i've always admired , but he never really connected american roles leading man . forever villain or sidekick here -- you turn his british resume his greatest performances ( check out sharpe saga ) . melanie griffith subdued believable somewhat sketchy part -- we never know quite what she . tommy lee jones provides his usual bravado . sting surprisingly good . someone who only flirted acting , this picture show you potential went unrealized . " stormy monday " definitely small picture , but very worthy . it effective mood piece -- one may initially seem bit slight , but it effect lingers you . kgharris , 11/06	1

before fulci earned his title " godfather gore " , which enhanced(and some , ruined ) his reputation , fulci made this very entertaining giallo film . i'm not 100% sure , but i believe this film actually got him blacklisted or something back 70s . duckling story young boys who murdered small town . who doing it ? it peeping tom village idiot ? local wizard ? witch who sticks pins in(and spits ) wax figures boys ? priest ? priest shady mother ? sexy annette o'toole lookalike thing drugs 12 year old boys ? reporter ? or maybe police themselves ? you'll watch it see , fulci decent job keeping us dark . those buying this trademark gore we all love disappointed . there only two real scenes violence . one identical whipping scene opening beyond , other killer demise which looks pretty silly , but still cool . this film shows what talent fulci , proves he wasn't complete hackmeister .... only mostly . i think there quite few critics who actually like this one . though low gore , it far p.c. subject matter unsettling enough , but there quite tantalizing scene every boy dream come life . leading lady one point throws herself one boys , but boy pesky mother interrupts . young boys allowed act scenes naked women ? i suppose they could italy early 70s . watch it , good flick	1

this not shoot-em-up western . if what you after , stop reading right here . what this , real heartfelt tribute cowboy . genuine article cowboy . particular , it charts group cowboys through decline golden age cowboy , near end 19th century . almost whole first half movie , there no plot speak , just character exposition building up picture life character these men . nothing rushed , yet it never dull , thanks intelligent script . there humorous moments great lines , but plenty pathos melancholy too , characters all deal end era their own ways . we see cowboy-turned-outlaw , cowboy-turned-storekeeper , cowboy-turned-floor sweeper ... but most all we see cowboy turned into legend . plot kicks , there nothing contrived it , but it all feeds into central idea examining what men when their purpose taken away them . movie benefits some great performances some classic character actors such william devane barry corbin , well brilliant star turn tom selleck who never better . it also benefits stunning scenery - ironically not wyoming movie suggests , but shot canada . sweeping vistas , free any trace civilization , set against backdrop rockies , stunning superbly photographed . what pulls this above it tv-movie-of-the-week origins sincerity poured into it all concerned , not least prolific director simon wincer ( lonesome dove , quigley down under ... crocodile dundee los angeles ! ) executive producer tom selleck . this fills movie those little , almost subliminal moments which make it feel real . result no classic big screen film , but perfectly judged understated homage bygone era . it leaves us notion , though golden age over , there always real cowboys .	1

it seems many us who taking time review this very good movie came away same feeling disapointment weak title lack promotion . i didn't realize until reading others ' reviews movie three hours long because it didn't seem long me . end journey , you understand building wealth , reputation , political idealism ... things which seem matter so much moment , mean very little . possesions mean little . who we , ultimately , means lot ... what left after world takes its toll . i'm usually very attached characters , but perspective this movie wasn't characters . it through larger lens character perspetives seemed small comparison .	1

very powerful , all means . i think it movie enjoyed many . cast amazing redgrave fry . i think this far one best performances jude law lover wilde . i always thought all his performances turn out powerful , honest , but very similar each other general . but here , he molds himself around such different personality , it very hard pass his existence influence story even scenes he not present . both jude law , jennifer ehle ( wife ) could turn out 2 dimensional whatever characters , but they much more than . they not dry , their relationships fry just written , acted , depicted wonderfully . good script , very powerful performances , never loses momentum , decisiveness , or its artistic strength . plus , many young talents orlando bloom , ioan gruffudd , adam garcia , tom wilkinson etc . seen small roles which makes movie seem even more decadent rich .	1

watched this movie twice , going back forth scenes . trying find tangible clue , she affair .. or not ? this affair emotional or physical or both ? my husband i both discussed this . comparing movie our married friends lives , well our own , we saw true depiction how mariage grow stale not meet our preconceived notions . i only believe individually we responsible our own personal growth , our happiness . when you marry , person they always , no matter what changes life , deep down . we examples , methods etc . we adapt we go but you cannot expect change someone . you sorely disappointed . unfortunately , we don't always grow same pace same direction . it either make , break , or promise endless sadness dream " what could .

les miserables always wonderful , but dream cast concert surely deserves special mention . i seen dvd five times , still am held spellbound exquisite music amazing performances . it truly dream cast . colm wilkinson delivers his songs beautifully perfected panache . he manages portray valjean both veiled threat ex-convict softened repentance philanthropistic mayor . phillip quast epitomy javert , managing create inspector who both law-bound human once . alun armstrong performs most hilarious thernadier i ever seen , expertly backed jenny galloway . michael maguire passionately fierce enjolras , michael ball performs marius just right touch good humour . ruthie henshaw fantine suitably poignant , while lea salonga clear voice superb acting skills make certain her eponine never forgotten . while i found singing acting fantastic , after few viewings dvd , discerning watcher becomes more intrigued what performers doing while sitting down . interaction javert valjean especially intriguing . it satisfying , too , all those who wished two redoubtable characters could friends . also worth mention heart-stopping rendition you hear people sing end concert performed 17 valjean some world productions . i highly reccomend this production .	1

life great lenny bruce who paved way so many great comedians come . dustin hoffman plays bruce greatly realistic , well valerie perrine bruces stripper wife honey . movie slow going could put anyone sleep , especially those unfamiliar bruce . i suggest watching documentary " lenny bruce : swear tell truth " first get more acquainted bruce comedian . lenny bruce really important figure our american history he tried all his might beat hypocritical system . unfortunately he lost but his work some most important fullfilling any generation because he spoke truth informed all how screwed up it really . i want give this 5 stars because it important film but i said most film drags , especially first half . but i recommend it those who want see great dustin hoffman work those who want familiarize themselves bruce all hype surrounding him . bruce surrounded himself strippers , sex drugs this film documents side him.so those looking comedy very disappointed this full out drama , eventhough their moments bruces routine funny . those looking laugh should check out some bruces work disc . all all i recommend this non-republicans(he he ) open-minds alike	1

tommyknockers one more unsuccessful stephen king adaptations hit screen . originally 1993 tv miniseries , movie suffers lackluster direction , mediocre performances no sense true suspense or horror . typically set homey little new england town , plot centers discovery mysterious object woods local writer ( marg helgenberger ) who her alcoholic poet boyfriend(a poorly cast jimmy smits ) decides keep it secret until whole thing unearthed . meanwhile , ghostly green light emits object , causing townspeople go bonkers one form or , whether it inventing stupid gadgets or wandering around glowing green eyes . three hours , tommyknockers definitely overstays its welcome one problem watching miniseries one take ; it become redundant . tighter direction more focused cast could helped but aside john ashton , eg marshall joanna cassidy supporting roles , most performances seem phone , traci lords ridiculously hilarious postal slut . real misfire	1

`the greatest story ever told ' magnificent . it classic sweep splendor lives up its title . while there some questional interpretations , some scenes unnecessarily plodding , performances strong crowd scenes often rousing . filmed utah , cinematography gives grandeur match film . max von sydow provides proper transcendence jesus , charlton heston demonstrates both passion prudent understatement john baptist . honorable mention goes telly savalas who gives right ambiance pilate . furthermore , judas portrayal conflicted betrayor proper subtlety even if his lines don't always match character .

when i first saw this movie shelf local video store , i quite bit trepidation . yet , i rented it . now i own dvd , i can't count number times i've seen it . no , it not original concept , no , it not animal house . i don't think they're really trying animal house , though , even if they give quite few nods movie . what this movie , something light comedic you sit back enjoy . comedy crude times but well , play relationships dildo fencing match . i said , you'll either love it or hate it . if you're type person who think any movie you see , you should probably move movie takes itself more seriously , because this one nothing sort . if you're looking animal house , try searching under " animal house " . just suggestion . beyond mere comedy movie , they actually some messages hidden underneath , we're not talking boxers or briefs . it common theme gender perceptions , peer pressure self-esteem . so maybe there something think after all	1

" then film gets nasty . it doesn't take too long discover jonas unbalanced cult leader who stop nothing protect his flock outsiders . there also tribe dangerous cannibals nearby , tribe nearly finished off mark sheila their journey into village . jonas cannibals don't get all , but there benefit bunch flesh eaters hovering around perimeter ; they keep followers perpetual state fear , which keeps them inside camp further mind control fun games . how jonas keep his followers line ? he makes them drink some sort juice turns them into mindless automatons , starters , then moves tried true methods torture , murder , banishment dissenters into cannibal camp . soon , sheila morris falls under jonas wicked enchantments , leaving it up mark diana plan inevitable escape . it bit frustrating review film like " mangiati vivi " because you can't talk depth atrocities . lenzi throws out bit everything , not only recreating jim jones massacre small scale , grape kool aid all , but also subjecting us cannibal atrocities . final scenes , diana morris cannibal film regular me me lai falling prey cannibals , ranks right up there anything you see deodato " cannibal holocaust . " good reason -- because lenzi stole chunks it deodato " jungle holocaust " feature . he also borrowed footage sergio martino " slave cannibal god . " oops . plagiarism aside , this stuff so deeply disturbing shockingly realistic , least certain parts , one boggles over how something like this ever got made . answer probably lies fact these movies largely appeared 1970s , time when almost anything went cinema . there no way something like " mangiati vivi " would play theaters today , definitely no way lenzi could secure financing such extreme film . if anybody hollywood tried pass this one off studio , his or her career would permanently suffer . extras disc include interviews robert kerman , ivan rassimov , umberto lenzi ; poster film stills ; five awesome trailers such schlock classics bruno mattei " zombi 3 , " " zombi holocaust , " " jungle holocaust , " " zombie 4 , " " mangiati vivi . " listening these interviews lot fun , especially robert kerman . i would never suspected he went lengthy career adult film business after this movie ! unfortunately , rassimov talk less interesting because he doesn't seem remember much making movie . if you feel like jumping into gory cannibal genre , you find plenty here wet your whistle . make sure watch " cannibal holocaust , " " jungle holocaust , " tamer " slave cannibal god " soon after .	1
none three young stars this film - norm macdonald , artie lange or traylor howard - ever became movie stars but they combined make this funny film , albeit what i call lame-brain ( somewhat low-class but effective humor ) one . this not untypical comedy today : tons sleazy jokes , sightgags , lightweight romance story , generally stupid story happy ending ..... yet this one far more appealing than most i've seen .... more i watch it , more i like it ! macdonald very likable guy lead . he just friendly face demeanor him . he makes film . lange bit loud . i'm glad film wasn't longer because lange constant shouting begins become grating . traylor , she acted well pretty face . after watching this twice , i wondered why she never made it , but least she now found tv fame new partner hit tv series , " monk . " two veterans actors here - jack warden chevy chase - play irreverent sleazy roles , something they certainly before ..... well . warden brutal ultimate dirty old man chase smug always . don rickles makes short appearances his normal obnoxious character john goodman makes cameo near end . main story this movie familiar one : revenge , but this time it played strictly laughs , there plenty . movie shows revenge isn't just sweet , it funny . what you say ? movie crude , it sentimental , it fun 82 minutes .	1
i remember seeing this movie years ago college continued like it ever since . movie starts off 1988 calgary olympics . doug dorsey ( d.b. sweeny ) talented hockey player kate mosley ( moira kelly ) pairs figure skater . both mishaps during their big moments , doug suffering career ending injury kate falling during her performace failing meet her own expectations . movie picks up few years later kate trouble getting new partner doug skids unable fulfill his dream becoming star hockey player . added mix kate russian couch anton pamchenko ( played great roy dotrice ) who decides rick kate new partner they struggle get back 1992 olympics . first glance this sports movie figure skating , but not entirely so . scenes involving leads ice surprisingly abstract neither professional skater . truth this character driven story most action takes place off ice . it absolutely charming watch two lead characters go dislike one , extreme rivalry finally ending up love . thing absolutely makes this happen chemestry leads sweeney kelly . they magic together screen , so much so i am surprised they never paired up again movie . i highly recommend this light hearted romance everyone . side note dvd , only special feature theatrical trailer . there no deleted scenes . this where i question , because version film this dvd i've scene tv recent years not one i remember seeing college . i distinctly remember end scene medal ceremony . i somewhat like version because what doug kate won version so much more . so where version alternative ending ???	1

although it some time since i last saw this film , it my " must " list based wonderful musical score , charismatic leads , its importance vehicle black american talent time when racial discrimination rife . dandridge would true hollywood success story her years hollywood today . america still hesitant give black performers key roles motion pictures . true , we films such cabin sky ( 1943 ) but where film go ? otto preminger must credited taking big chance making this all-black picture concerning carmen jones , who works parachute factory , soldier , belafonte , who must escort her magistrate when she broken law . dorothy dandridge nailed this role carman jones . she catty , seductive , her men wrapped around her finger . harry belafonte sensational joe , naive soldier who becomes prey carman . it interesting watch joe trying tame wild tendencies carman , while love triangle grows outside their relationship . it like watching cat hot tin roof . ( oops , great movie . ) added plus wonderful production numbers dance choreography songs . costume , wardrobe , props reflect culture city slickers country folks , presenting differences lifestyles among characters . these differences became evident dorothy dandridge performance , earn her academy award nomination best actress . halle berry oscar acceptance speech best actress monster ball reminded me just how far we come how long it taken reach this stage journey ! if you haven't yet seen carmen jones - take time view this milestone american cinema history - you won't disappointed .	1
i seen this movie several times videotape am eagerly awaiting criterion collection issue , which it richly deserves . movie set burma ( now myanmar)at end wwii , just after armistice . troop japanese soldiers created very tight-knitted solidarity among themselves through efforts captain inuoe , music teacher . one his soldiers , muzashima , built mastered burmese harp plays it when unit sings chorus . captain inoue troop surrender british , muzashima offers himself negotiator persuade rogue unit japanese soldiers cornered cave give themselves up ; they refuse bombarded killed ; muzashima , however , escapes disguises himself buddhist monk . movie becomes very touching because he tries unite himself his unit , he treated honor moank , he begins behave like monk -- he starts burying proper rituals orphaned , exposed corpses japanese soldiers . he eventually finds his squad ; he stands outside fence prison compound ; soldiers , who believe he killed , recognize him even though they see he become very different person . he serenaded their haunting music , he replies wordlessly playing fareweall song his harp -- but he cannot become one them now , because he found mission : give proper burial all japanese war corpses burma . i cannot justly articulate how deeply touching it see this man , japanese , renounce his homeland his tighly-knit company men he shared deepest experiences -- become solitary , itinerant undertaker completely alien land . there transcendence abandonment self breathtaking . i've seen many movies life christ , but oddly enough , this japanese movie , no theological or ideological intentions , seems capture spirit better than any them . just case you missed point , i'm standing my tiptoes give this movie highest rating i : real masterpiece .	1
like review i just read , tarkovskies ' andre rublev movie i keep coming back over years . it my favorite film until something special comes . more than any filmmaker any country , any language , this movie imparted impressed it viewpoint into my perception . i incorporated it into my vision . i resonate it ... it plays me like bell . it not entertainment really though much it entertaining . this film transcends both entertainment mere artistic success - images themes so spiritually charged archetypically strong one may sense while watching it , he or she remembering half forgotten dreams . like person whose review i just read , i often pause simple wonder after chapter just let it ring . film chronicles life spiritual development russian artist , icon painter andre rublev . epic unfolds 6 chapters last which introduces artist , young church bell maker . chapter reveals aspects components creative process both literally allegory ... one senses filmmaker tarkovsy young bell-maker may great deal common he may written himself into this section .... this last chapter " spring " shot through narrative vitality , energetic quality expression simply colossal - there joy unfolding discovery this bell-makers own creative powers ... all which witnessed aging jaded andre rublev who , witness , transformed what he sees , anyone who eyes see apprehend naked wonder this last chapter . andre tarkovsky made this film what used ussr during period rigid scrutinizing censorship . he used artistic restraints hoops he jump through brilliant advantage carefully codifying individual artistic spiritual themes into chapters this epic . constraints seem served discipline streamline narrative ... result golden ... more truth per foot film than any i compare it . i saw it first video college russian art history class , later bought dvd , more recently attended screening disney studios colleague given invite but couldn't make . i brought someone who just didn't get it . tarkovsy not everyone though you should give yourself benefit doubt because , if he you , you may very well changed touched rewarded again again this truly timeless gem	1
