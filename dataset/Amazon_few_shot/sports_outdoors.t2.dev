two amazon statements this product absolutely misleading : 1 . " usually ships 24 hours " . it actually took 1 week ship it . 2 . when i finally received package it turned out watch didn't " leather band " . band made artificial materials ( nylon rubber ) or something like . i return it	1
our three year old twins received two these cars christmas . joystick control broke one cars one hour after they received them christmas day ! my husband ordered replacement car then shortly after , other cars ' joystick control broke ! so , now we stuck two broken cars one work , but wondering when one break too ! i need mention kids not particularly rough cars ; we right there when other car broke not witness any rough behavior . controls cheap break eventually . cars very loud , but positive side , kids love them provide fun entertainment them . i would definitely not recommend this product	1
it best price around when it finally showed up my door i couldn't wait put it together until it harder than it looked . you should use more than one person put it together maybe it my fault but net not fast nor easy set up , just like box says it challenge . extremely ! i would not recommend this product someone who no time nor patience hour long set up process . i recommend anything folds up quick pops up into position . but extreme deal would actual 10x10x10 cage you could get online less than 500$ . you might spend money but not deal headaches over over again putting this together well worth it . find your self area out side build your real cage enjoy it all year long . nets not worth time nor money , balls still fly up out net , you really close fabric just like tent . much force im hitting balls it wont long till material damaged . dont waste your money even if you get it 60 bucks . wind always win , once it catches sail it tumbles like sage grass . get bigger better deals real cage	1

this imported ' sword ' actually long dagger , size wwii-era bayonet . scabbard it all 15 inches . construction , fitment parts , finish , overall quality poor . definitely mass-produced , low quality item . blade plain stainless steel would not hold edge . it would properly labeled " masonic-ish " sword symbolism handle , guard , scabbard not strictly conform those any branch masonry . there prominent red crosses few knights templar-ish symbols but no one knows anything masonry would mistake this genunine implemen t.t he blade sharply pointed so this not something children should play ! it looks okay hanging wall ( scabbard ) but all it good . price not bargain , it right chinese-made import this size quality . long you don't expect more what i described , you might like this item	-1

i bought this watch one design sailboat racing , it many thoughful improvements over other watches/countdown timers . it countdown timer sync button reminder beeps , tack/gybe angle calculator benzel like " one-wheel " musto compucourse or citizen sailhawk or navisail . it fits nice niche below expensive full function regatta watches like citizen sailhawk suunto regatta would shame beat up while racing , more features than inexpensive timex ironman or optimum time series race watches . pros : -countdown timer beeps minute every 59 seconds , every ten seconds last minute , every second last ten seconds . -count up or repeat option after countdown complete . repeat doesn't stop after seven times unlike casio watches . -long hold required stop countdown timer . electronic lock sync button manually activated . -countdown particular time so race committee start gun exact minute ( like 11am promptly ) . -tactical benzel click stops every five degrees so less likely drift lose track wind direction during race . -reasonable large numbers countdown timer-nice euro look isn't fugly imho unlike old musto competition watch or ronstan clear start watch so it worn outside race course . -left out silly sensors such electronic compass , barometer , altimeter useless day racing makes watch more afforable than suunto sailing watches these functions . -one design class legal because it doesn't built gps . still love my foretrex 201 races which allow them , but this looks like good pre-start timer strict od class regattas don't allow gps . cons : -benzel only click stops but no lock so drift during normal sailboat operations . -no 5-degree markers benzel interpolating 15 degree labels result errors . also no 70 degree or 80 degree tack angle marks watch inside benzel . why doesn't someone come out cheap digital tack angle computer watch help us joes poor memory remember tack angles ? calculation tack angles easy . its hard recalculating tack angles detect headers/lifts because you forgot numbers while steering boat puffy , choppy conditions while simultaneously looking air , looking mark , jostling dozen other boats going upwind . -non-intuitive buttons menus strange short or long press certain buttons different functions requires time spent instruction manual scratching one head . -not all functions documented instructions such logbook . -silly designers mixed up starboard port tack angle arrow colors . arrow pointing 45 degrees left north would port direction , but starboard tack should green . gybe angle colors correct .	1

this heavy bag stand pretty good piece equipment . heavy bag part it definitely requires add'l weight ( hint : bags sand much cheaper than amount barbell plates you'll need keep this thing moving - i use 200 pounds bags sand keep it place . also sure you get double end heavy bag too ( i.e. one bottom d-ring ) , otherwise you'll get too much bag swing . you also put true double end light bag this portion unit , which nice change pace heavy bag . ( light double end bag small inflatable two bungees holding it chest level reverberates like mad when you hit it . ) speed bag platform bit flimsy , especially earlier models where " drum " or rebound board two pieces ( latest versions this model use single piece drum ) . if you become moderately proficient speed bag any amount time you'll outgrow this aspect unit . part problem single vertical pole which speedbag drum attaches flex when you get bag moving really fast , throw off your timing . use smallest size speed bag possible minimize this inertia . lastly , speed bag platform doesn't really adjust high enough people over 6'2 " height , if you're over 6'1 " or so you're going need use small or xtra small speed bag it hang correct height ( i.e. belly bag mouth/chin level )	1

any sword only $15 fact very dangerous . these swords called wallhangers because they only designed hung wall , not swung . reason underneath handle very small piece metal connects blade itself . ( called tang ) real martial arts sword , tang normally thick piece metal almost thickness sword itself . if you swing wallhanger too often or too hard it break tang , fly off hurt someone . if you want learn more how dangerous these wallhangers google search words : anatomy wallhangerany sword designed real martial arts practice- like iaido , starts $250 not $15 , should bought reputable iaido store .

past couple decades , only real name pocket flashlights maglite minimag . used police professionals alike , even honored design awards , minimag pretty much ran show since it introduction 1984 . sure , light output just decent , " beam focus " feature gimmick no one really used , but well-engineered flashlight , it couldn't beat . until now . it classic david vs goliath tale - fenix p1d-ce small even small flashlight scale , keyring small , silly small ; picture cylinder roughly half height aluminum soda diameter nickel : that kind small we're talking here . it doesn't even look real ; size combined perfectly smooth exquisitely faceted exterior gives impression this perhaps 1/2 scale mock up actual flashligh t.t he disbelief continues you remove fenix it slightly-larger-than-a-cigarette-pack box . p1d-ce without battery weighs 27 grams , or weight 27 paper clips . more precisely , that less mass than ipod nano . that * less than one ounce * . but feel without question cold unyielding touch heavy-gauge type iii aluminum , lens not just actual glass , but perfectly flat coated optics-grade glass . size might not serious , but engineering certainly . yet all dimensional absurdity just prelude light itself - this where real ridiculousness begins : light phosphor-white ( similar hid car headlight color ) , but plainly speaking , there more it than physically possible object this size . it would make more sense if someone standing behind you spotlight , or perhaps if fenix nuclear-powered . p1d-ce produces * more than twice total light output 4 cell full-size maglite * . point fenix ceiling unlit room area lit more ambient light than 15 watt light bulb . license plates street signs hundreds feet away blaze life night . shine it your eyes you're legally blind next twenty seconds . course , unless you turn it down ... if fenix engineers weren't content alien-technology light source , p1d-ce also includes " modes " which give you range lighting options . you probably don't always want walk around flashlight blazing full-tilt , so there low , medium , high settings . twisting head flashlight turns it , twisting it off again moves it into next mode . there also " strobe " mode , which flicks light off quickly stroboscopic effect , sos , allowing you send emergency signal automatically without further touching flashlight all . all this powered - ( drum roll ) - one battery . no fumbling giant family packs box store batteries just get some light , single 123a lithium battery ( sold overpriced your local store " photo batteries " section , find them online less than $2 each ) powers everything . battery life varies wildly modes - low mode net you over 10 hours , while high suck cell dry less than hour . but key here " intelligent " circuitry ; unlike flashlights old , where you could determine battery life how bright light , fenix employs power regulator circuit - no more slowly fading light over time , leaving you wonder if flashlight really bright it could ; p1d-ce just bright when batteries first installed nearly all total runtime . means low setting , ninth hour beyond just bright first few minutes . since it lithium battery , months shelf time doesn't make difference . so what fenix secret ? it all comes down led technology , durham , north carolina-made cree led p1d-ce fine example . just you buy led light bulb your house which uses less than tenth energy incandescent bulb , same concept works just well flashlights , people starting notice - these super-small , super-efficient led flashlights all rage nowadays ; police departments actually doing away old full-size maglite replacing them newer better mini led lights , which p1d-ce large margin brightest most versatile . you're only $70 away dumping your vintage incandescent antique joining them . five tiny but beaming stars fenix remarkable introduction 21st century lighting technology . ( addendum : what new led minimag ? maglite new led series minimags less than half light output fenix , their " energy management " circuit doesn't quite live up it name , so light gradually dims over time like most other flashlights . led minimags also larger heavier than incandescent originals , still use plastic lens prone scuffing , still use type ii aluminum collects nicks scratches over time . powered regular aa cells [ no brightness options ] , battery life most four hours until completely dead , plus there no polarity protection ; should you accidentally place batteries backwards , light destroyed . led minimag definite improvement over original , but not quite par fenix .	1

i've got relatively small knife collection ( maybe 15 blades ) , but this one i tend carry every day . i've got few kershaws , speed-safe opening what initially attracted me brand . said , while it cool way open knife , i've ultimately decided it mostly gimmick . i find it just fast , somewhat easier , open knife thumb stud . my collection 3 other kershaws : two chives avalanche . leek best size carry/defensive knife . blade long without cumbersome , shape sleek manageable . knife also good chores , although anything really heavy , i'd use bigger blade like avalanche or blur . black finish nice -- although truthfully , my leek titanium oxide ( rainbow ) . one my chives black , though , finish sleek holds up well . this knife definitely worth price	1

i carry least one swiss army knife me every where i go ( except plane , course ) . this 3 1/2 inch all-purpose tool suitable your pocket , glove compartment or tool box . this knife dozens uses do-it-yourselfer , gardener or camper . this little wonder large small knife , corkscrew , punch , opener flat blade screwdrive end , bottle opener flat blade screwdriver end what purports wire stripper side ( i never used ) , key ring , tweezers toothpick . this knife water resistant made high quality components . i tend use knives pocket knife more than any other tools . after i find combination one knives tweezers useful splinters thorns , thus tweezers often become third most useful tool . i must admit occasionally i use toothpick , particularly when real toothpicks not available . smaller screwdriver blade small enough it also fit into phillips head screw . i even able use flat blade some small internal hex head screws . i never used corkscrew , i used punch awl . opener blade yet used this knife well . difficulty carrying tools they fill your pocket very quickly . this small swiss army knife small enough fit into purse or pocket yet large enough useful . while larger swiss army knives even more larger tools blades , they also harder carry . course this particular knife not replace tool box , but i find it amazing how many tasks i accomplish simple tools available this gem .	1
used this pedometer several weeks i found it not always record your activity . like previous reviewer , i noticed my first usage it may not record your steps when you not walking quickly . but past few days i also found it not always record vigorous walking either . it simply stops recording entirely times . i pedometer , costing less than half what this one cost , without all bells whistles , but it accurate dependable . this product not only not worth price charged it , but given its inaccuracy , not worth any price	-1

i'm very satisfied this lifetime basketball system . amazon free shipping great , but somewhat slow . i assembled setup unit myself , but times two people would convenient . if assembling yourself , just sure you few things like garbage cans or boxes support it when needed . i even raised hoop myself , which pretty easy . i found instructions sufficient , not terrible , but not great either . first thing i inventory parts nothing missing . there no extra parts either . i recommend you inventory parts if no other reason than become familiar many parts . some readers felt optional drill bit needed . this isn't case because all screws self tap also self drilling . i never used drill bit . but sure you good power drill drill drive screws where needed . i careful took my time assemble unit . i guess my assembly time 6-1/2 hours , i assembled it multiple times . there few confusing steps but little thought it fiqured out drawings . instructions mostly assembly drawings rather than step step detailed explanations what . hoop mechanism raises lowers ease . i filled base water system seems sufficiently stable . i spoke lifetime they recommend not using antifreeze . they said base designed withstand freezing water expansion contraction . i didn't use sand because fill opening so small i imagine it would quite problem emptying base sand if i move unit someday . i think this system excellent value , but i noticed amazon significantly raised price since i purchase mine 1 month ago	1

resident pacific northwest person new sport triathlon , i confronted unfortunate truth this winter - there not many good biking days after september . work , weather , sun deprivation , i finding it hard regularly fit trip gym ride , much less get my bike . minoura hybrid trainer tops my christmas wish list . i looked into other options , minoura seemed like good point entry . fluid/mag hybrid touted low noise " road-like " , but overall cost i still found affordable . i quite happy since i first unpacked it . my observations : 1 ) instructions simple actually written english ( welcome change over all-graphic instructions all too common ) . one point unclear use skewer ( crossbar through rear wheel ) . skewer provided , but my bike fit fine using skewer already rear wheel . 2 ) once assembled , it quite simple attach bike . i spend more time getting my shoes , shorts , towel my workout than i putting bike trainer . 3 ) balance stability good . i not any concerns , even when listening ipod or otherwise not devoting full attention . 4 ) most important aspect , workout , exactly what i wanted . i'm able get my heart rate up whatever training zone i want . resistance provided magnet smooth proportion effort i expend . need simulate intervals ? no problem . resistance changes nicely each shift gears . when workout ends , my thighs " feel it " like they would after similar length time effort road . 5 ) riser block nice touch ships same package trainer . 6 ) consider getting training aid encourage you vary workout . otherwise , it too easy get steady cadence not vary it through duration workout .	1

first , this beautifully designed built machine . rowing action smooth closely resembles feel rowing shell . it quiet easily adjust people differing heights . while machine large foot print when use , it easily fold into compact size storage or simply clear floor space . due quietness this device , it joy listen music or watch movie while working out . other exercise equipment i too noisy this . others stated , it easy under estimate amount exercise you're getting . even though i often end hour rowing feeling like i really haven't much , feeling my legs when standing up afterwards lets me know i've good workout . assembly time consuming , but not really difficult . other reviewers stated , parts high quality , finish fit excellent . three minor problems i've encountered easily fixed : 1 ) smooth cement floor , machine tended drift during long work out . carpeting or rubber pad under machine fixed this . 2 ) hard plastic handles become slippery when wet sweat . wearing pair cotton work gloves resolves this problem extra benefit protecting your hands friction handles . 3 ) shipped , foot straps tend work loose during exercise . this due assembly problem factory . when straps properly positioned , they don't slip . fix this problem , remove two screws ( one each foot plate ) hold straps position . while you're it , you might want reverse one straps so both buckle outside your feet . when you tighten straps , position them so back buckle touches foot plate . this leaves end strap going through buckle pulling same plane buckle . loosen strap , pull end buckle away your foot , increasing angle which strap enters buckle . straps loosen during exercise because factory setting leaves end strap pulling angle buckle . very slight change this angle sufficient loosen strap . note i didn't try replace two screws . replacing screws buckle properly positioned may make it easier tighten straps . despite minor problems mentioned above , this excellent machine well worth expense . it clearly deserves rating five .	1
this fine weapon average citizen who not inclined carry knife or handgun , but it cannot effective cane or police baton , two other alternatives consider . cane perhaps most innocent seeming yet it reach advantages over kubotan deal most damaging strike . above review good one , but please ignore advice sharpening keys using kubotan flail . this unlikely provide any real stopping power determined attacker . kubotan excels loadfist weapon , so use it enhance your hammerfist punch strikes . you also use point ' stab ' your attacker body points bony targets like back hand excruciatingly painful when struck . other words use kubotan like it intended so . nowhere any traditional yawara training it used like mini-flail like above poster suggested	1
