color actually received ear rings quite light . darker amethyst color would much better picture computer screen really deceptive , since showed much darker colored amethyst . i won't buy jewelry amazon again when it comes colored stone . hsn depicts their jewelry much better screen provides better stone quality products	1
nice looking but very serious design and/or manufacturing flaw - after less than 2 month use office environment glass cracked without any impact whatsoever . now i'll find out if skagen customer service any good . $70 watch i certainly expected better quality . after reading other reviews this models i realized many other people same issue . bottom line -avoid !!	1
these my mom wishlist , so i bought them . they just arrived i'm totally disappointed . i'd return them if it wouldn't cost me i wasn't so lazy . they look pretty darn cheap , starters . also , they came little , plastic zipper bag inside little , pseudo-velour bag , price tag $3.30 it . save your money . it best not buy jewlery sight unseen	1

i don't know who running show amazon , but thier packing atrocious ... they packed this watch only single air bubble . course when i received it it fell out its tin , scratched ... wary buying anything amazon regards precious jewelry ..... watch fine though , so if you really want this item , purchase it somewhere else	-1

my wife received this heart rate monitor me christmas 2005 . first my wife , them my father law then finally i unable get chest strap begin transmitting wrist watch . we read documentation looked timex web page without success so far . it now january 2nd i still cannot get it working . i may change my review later if i find this all due operator error , but this point three well educated people unable figure it out . very least there problem either ease use or documentation . fitness sensor user guide there pieces listed not my box . however , web page not mention them . i suspect guide older version . if not , perhaps there shipping error . any case , i am not happy .	-1
i really liked watch it looked picture . but , when i purchased it , i realized its way too shiny . if you thin wrist , then watch looks really bulky . besides , 12 o'clock mark watch not exactly north . so , you tilt your head make sense time ... i am going return this watch ..	1
this set earrings only $10 delivery silver insanity fast , but false advertising really pisses me off . they not look nearly nice picture , fact " glass " part earring plastic ... it even bubbles it . it ugly . other earrings i bought them also not look much like their photos	-1
i love knowing exact time ( even if my mom thinks i am crazy ) , it works like ... clock ! i never issues updates ( illinois ) , but i few minor issues : watch too thick ( 5/8 inch ) , band made gorilla very difficult adjust human , buttons hard press , manual too small hard read . still , if i choice this watch or my borhter rolex , i take his rolex exchange it 40 casios . thank you , casio	1

lovely jewelry , great price , but clasp pretty tough work . this not necklace anyone stiff fingers . i'm also worried clasp might not hold up repeated use wish it more traditional link link closure than this insert-key type clasp . it probably great choice very occassional use , though quality price , it really regular-use type necklace . i think it best suited nimble-fingered , traditional-fashion person	1

equal my swiss watches . fit finish very nice . only two seconds off per day . luminessence incredable . reason not giving five starsbecause not saphire crystal	1
watch looks great ; prominent , yet not overly large . orange really sets off look . large luminescent indexes easy see long after dark . i also like both day date complications , find automatic watch these features less than $300 ( way less amazon ) really find . you need pro adjust bracelet , though , each link pin held two tiny bushings impossible replace without proper jeweler tools . bother watch gains over minute day . overall , i really like it . it become my daily wear watch .	1

this ring absolutely gorgeous i havent taken it off since recieving it . but when buying this ring , careful not take string off bands . this string protects you well .... insanity . i unfortunately took off string my ring separated into 4 separate bands . luckily i found website gave me instructions how reassemble it . my dad put it back together it fine , but i admit i'm little distraut how there no indication or warning telling people not take it off . if this happen you , google " puzzle ring solutions " there many websites guide you restoring your ring normal .	1

i bought nighthawk ( although one leather band ) year ago i very pleased it . it looks very masculine classy , style certainly age well . slide rule takes little figuring out , but it very useful . it keeps time pretty well , too . i've only got couple complaints : leather band , which i picked because metal bands always uncomfortable me , little too large my wrist . even when i use innermost hole band , watch still kind floppy . price , watch could sapphire crystal instead glass one . those conplaints very minor compared everything i like watch . i didn't want give watch five stars if i complaints it , but my rating would probably more like 4.75 stars . price , it great value .	1
i always wear timex never problem	1
beautiful box hold most my watches . two other watch boxes hold 11 watches ea some rings . this box holds those watches less space ! no place rings not minus my opinion . nice able see 10 my most worn watches glance ! 10 drawer below . if you several watches you want put nice looking , good quality box you not go wrong buying this item	1
this watch classic . i no issues it losing minutes . i am very tough watches , i never take them off , this watch real tank . i needlessly worried red blue dial would chip or scratched off . i am amazed it not b/c i accidentally scraped , smashed it into doors , walls etc ... same dial , tough diamonds . it big watch , so it may not everyone , but if you like styling , it steal . seals never weaken b/c it never opened change battery . i am very impressed	1
review below " owen wilson " pretty funny . he never took it out box , it stopped running , so he returned it . lol ! it automatic watch , dude ! you wear it wind it , or it stops . anyways , i've mine 4 months now barely ever take it off . it keeps excellent time , gaining only second or two day . i really like this wonderful piece classic technology my wrist , i like size substantial weight it , it very comfortable wear . i took star off rating because original strap developed unpleasant odor after couple weeks , which no amount scrubbing would remove . i replaced it after-market italian rubber strap . 3 months later new strap still smells pleasantly vanilla , which i guess common additive real rubber straps . who knew ? original strap looked bit beefier more diver-like , but new strap deployment clasp which handy . occasionally i wish i bought skx007 instead , i like look round markers , but it hasn't bothered me much these square , i prefer second hand this watch . i really like way sat blue sun red - reminds me it weekend . this my first modern automatic overall i'm very happy my purchase .	1

when shopping around new watch , this model fit bill perfectly . analogue face , additional functions ( date , stopwatch , alarm ) , waterproof , perfectly sized case . bonus finish - black ( very dark grey ? ) gold details . i thought all metal cased watches these days silver or gold little variation , so it nice surprise find this model . one slight gotcha - what appears " second " hand face not actually second hand . it used stopwatch . there smaller face ( located 9 o'clock main dial ) counts seconds . little odd , but not big deal . still very happy product . all this got it half price amazon . nice one	1
