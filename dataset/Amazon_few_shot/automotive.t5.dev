i put sunforce 50012 inside my car windscreen plugged it into cigar lighter . ( this car cigar lighter " live " even when ignition off ) . sunforce 50012 worked one day . next day it appeared dead ( there blue led blinks when it working ) . i picked it up , it started working , sat it down , it quite . twisted it , it worked , then it didn't , then it . old intermitant ( sp ) connection problem . basically it shot , dead , kaput , trash it . long story short , i fixed it taking it apart re-soldering components . i am smart lucky nothing better . 99.999% users could not make this fix . so just forget it . this thing garbage	-1

i wanted digital tire monitor becuz theyre supposed more accurate than stick models . this gauge comes instructions fairly easy use . my favorite part this gauge bleed valve . other gauges , you put air , then check gauge , put air , check it again . this gauge , you overinflate your tires little bit , then bleed air out valve til you reach your desired psi . assuming this lasts long time , i would recommend it everyone	1

many useful features this design : compact but capable rugged . recommended item emergency power outages , general service where portable power needed : starts dead car batteries , pumps tires , runs 120v tools , etc . two design shortcomings i hoped weren't there , keep it 5 stars - #1 : it charges either wall-wart 12v adapter , or 12v cigarette lighter plug . i much prefer direct 120v power cord connection versus wall adapter variety . #2 shortcoming : it doesn't self float-charge cycle - you must limit your charge times manually unplugging it ( battery damage if charged too long ) . ach ! still , guess person could attach his own float-charge unit instead supplied 12vdc adapter . but heck , wagan , design into it , like better powerpacks	-1

bought this , spent 15 minutes studying manual , plugged it , it worked first time -- read out " check engine " code , , when later plugged into pc , allowed details printed nice report . only negative i've noticed when you reset " check engine " code car computer , it erases reader memory it , so you pc printout before resetting code . some folks believe if you use device like this one car it " locked " car can't used different car . this not true -- i've used it several different cars no problems	-1
this ramp set just one heck item . traction great if wanted each three ramps used alone or all held together easily removable rubber hinge system . i like ramp because it used small wheel products like lawn mower , track machines like snow thrower , or even great loading platform my road king motorcycle . i recommend 77 " length set purchased if you store them easily because hinged attach platform vehicle easier load angle . enjoy !!	1
