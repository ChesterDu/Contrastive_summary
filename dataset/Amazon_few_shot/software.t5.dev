acrobat 5 so buggy i thought i'd give adobe couple product cycles before upgrading . should waited longer . there improvements v7 : better look , better commenting , ability add text actually prints , far better ocr functionality . but other basic functions way worse than v5 : some word documents easy convert pdf v5 not convert v7 , seems something font license issues . installation nightmare repeated re-installation required get past system hangs , clashes standard security software , endless errors automatic update feature . new product activation makes this even more pain because too many re-installations force you activate phone . despite my already low expectations adobe , this product disappointment . acrobat 7 , adobe , usual , charging top $ what any decent company would consider embarrassing mess even beta version .

several years ago i used delorme street atlas usb gps receiver . software worked but interface lousy . this year i tried microsoft streets trips 2007 surprised find it interface smoother some ways than delorme software , but still surprisingly clumsy . help possibly worst i seen microsoft product ( that saying lot ) . here some problems : 1 . street trips expecting gps receiver uses ** com port ** . you kidding me ? 2007 ??? delorme earthmate 20 ( usb ) work if you use delorme com port emulation software , but why this necessary ??? ( it not trivial get it work . ) 2 . handling pushpins ( identifying spots map ) , favorite places , like , extremely clumsy . ( although , contrary review , you don't re-enter information each time . you just save file reload it . ) 3 . directions sometimes not so great . why would you instruct someone " turn left " if you don't know which direction they're pointing ( e.g. , when you're stationary parking lot) ? much better such cases say " head ne " or some such . freeway exits ( least so . california ) often not handled well . ( one freeway entrance identified " local road " , which time proved quite confusing . ) 4 . why doesn't software automatically recalculate directions put you " on-route " once you're off-route ? you push f3 , but why this necessary ? 5 . i never got voice providing driving guidance work . online help useless . i'm sure someone jump tell me how it , but it should trivial . 6 . general , software feel bunch modules written independently thrown together . i'm not reflexive anti-microsoft bigot ( i bought this software after all ) , but i find much ms software bad precisely because it feels like it cobbled together without much attention given integration . it shiny surface but shine vanishes once you really start use it . given this experience , i probably give delorme software try next time around .	-1
everything negative reviewers say true more . please note following well : 1 . if you college student taking class online uses blackboard software , vista prevent you posting class discussion board answering any fill-in-the-blank or discussion questions tests ! fix this download foxfire browser ( free ) use it access your course . because vista uses so much memory already so huge , they drop quite few little programs software needs access operating system . 2 . huge memory hard drive drain . look this comparisonwindows xp professional size drive 1.5 gig memory requirements 128 mbwindows vista needs 15 gig load . not say how large program but i wouldn't think its small !!! memory requirements 1 gig ! if you check dell website you see they recommend you 2 gig memory use windows vista . few $$$ worth memory just run operating system while openning program . try running game or doing animation kind sink hole your system ! less memory you available , slower everything , including websites load ( no matter how fast your internet connection ) what worse fix what wrong it ( ie replace all those small programs your software expects find operating system ) , they add patches only make it bigger hungrier memory ! this most pathetic excuse upgrade i ever seen . i would expect some lawsuits before this over ! not buy this product	-1

teacher i use word , powerpoint , publisher when working students engaging professional activities ( presentations organizations , etc . ) i using office 2002 , thought i should upgrade . big mistake . ribbons icons frustrating scroll through , especially since i previously just customized toolbar so everything i needed immediately available . i'm still trying figure out how type chinese , although spanish german working fine . additionally , they've come up truly ugly color scheme their ribbons/icons/etc . previous commenter noted , making changes basic template creates extreme problems , i also unable get darn number bullets renumber . it took me almost twice long write test usual , i ended up doing manually what used quite easily using toolbar . designs publisher now very difficult see differentiate . previous versions , you could see stark differences different designs . current options pages , everything so soft , both line color , well so small , it hard tell what you're looking . but truly big disappointment powerpoint . their new selection slide designs all appeal rotting road kill -- i would embarrassed give presentation professional group using what available 2007 . i reinstalled my 2002 programs . i feel like i just wasted all money i spent this suite . my suggestion ? if you absolutely pc because you lot word processing , stick word 2002 or 2003 . if you need presentations/brochures/etc . your business , get mac avoid this problem altogether	-1

this worst software i bought . first , it cost $100 mcafee not honor $55 rebate because i sent rebate form little late . they only 15 days send out after purchase while compusa receipt much longer deadline send our rebate form . isn't kind trick ? second most important , it slowed down everything , not bit but dozens seconds or even more than 1 minute . third , speed not only problem , its wireless connection sucks maximum couple my machines can't get online can't connect network . i 3 pcs 1 laptop . only two machine get connected . it also conflicts belkin network card driver which so popular so many years . how hell mcafee not know adaptor ? fourth , there no manual whattsover you all figure out yourself . given it so much problem it very frustrating configure it . sometimes security center downloading forever . who hell knows what it doing . sucks . i spent so much time fine tune it it still sucks much . i changed back internet security suite which much better than this . don't buy it even they give it you free or you break disk .	-1
this first review i written probably few years . normally , i don't feel strongly enough any product , good or bad , bother entering review . this new version quicken , i something i feel strongly enough write . i using quicken close 20 years . i built all my finances around it . past 6 years , quicken going steadily downhill . this latest version , i hope , represents rock bottom . i don't see how product could possibly get any worse . words cannot describe how bad this product . no functionality added previous 6 years . what happened screen become more cluttered more links quicken " financial partners " , more redundant links other , old , program features , more white space . return , user page through tab after tab after tab view same information previously fit only 1 screen . further , each screen refresh now takes seconds , whereas older versions screen refresh instantaneous . entering simple transaction may require this bloated sofware generate 2 , 3 , even 4 complete screen refreshes , each one taking maybe 1 2 seconds . means , once you hit " enter " key complete transaction , you waiting long 8 seconds before you move entering next transaction . little 3 years ago same step required less than second . obviously , time required vary your computer - but it bad enough quicken now requires you " downgrade " your quicken software every few years - it also necessary you replace your entire computer system same time just so you realize same performance level you previous version . all this no additional features or functionality . there new kid block i am switching . it called " moneydance " . it import data quicken , it fast , compact , runs any platform , windows , linix , unix , mac , even os/2 . it easier use than quicken support great . it available download - functional evaluation version free full version only $30 . you actually speak person get help w/out pay . since i using quicken years , it take while test mondeydance out make sure it works properly . i am running 2 side-by-side while make sure numbers agree . so far , things going well . then i plan dump quicken forever . well run dry quicken ; everyone who made product great apparently left company . obviously people quicken free make their product bloated cumbersome they want . but they should not allowed force people downgrade . yet , what they doing . i am absolutely positively through quicken , i am not coming back	-1

i am retired senior software engineer ( web development ) . i've used many antivirus/malware packages both work home . this absolute worst . after installing it , i got popup virus alerts bitdefender every 10 seconds . no kidding . i couldn't believe it . i previously copy norton antivirus 5 my computer which highly reliable ( not like latest version ) . i tried bitdefender based reviews below which obviously written people less than standard operating systems . i use pc windows xp sp2 ie6 ( ie7 still buggy ) . although multiple runs bitdefender show absolutely no viruses or malware my system , i continue get these popup " virus alerts " every 10 seconds when i browse internet , which way more irritating than anything norton ever my computer . addition , it drags my computer almost screeching halt when i go web page i haven't more than day , sometimes even ones i just went hour ago . i find this truly irritating went bitdefender website tried their online chat . " jack " completely worthless . he told me completely wipe out my cookies , well lot other useful files no apparent reason other than he probably not named jack , but something like vishnu this first thing long list things tell people . very useless . not recommended anyone . try get old copy norton antivirus 5 pay update feature ($20 per year ) . much better than this garbage . addition , there virtually no options customizing this product . you're stuck what they think necessary ( like automatically deleting internet files you may need -- like shopping carts ) . it literally cripples your computer .	-1
we very disappointed this product because it provides almost no options customize spreadsheet . we cannot rename catagories not applicable us ( i.e. , child care ) , we cannot create new categories specific our needs . what even more limiting disppointing you cannot create different tab each month use comparison , which makes us wonder what value we gain single month finances captured . finally , bar graphs summary comparisons shaded same color background which makes it very difficult read	-1

this software might recommended if better utilities weren't out there . this one gives user sense security , but when my system crashed , fix-it couldn't . i dutifully put rescue disk , booted up it , restored my earlier system , exited rebooted . nothing . before i'd able get into safe mode , but now nothing . so when i manually restored my system , guess which program got yanked ? it freed up lot system resources , too . ( i known how much before , alone would soured me . ) my system now runs faster doesn't lag while typing . small criticism : even though fix-it automatic update virus scans , i found more often than not i go vcom site manually download anti-virus files . no reason ever given ; i'd just get message telling me it . very inconvenient . also warning*warning : this program strict activation . you only it one computer , so forget putting it your notebook computer . finally , careful when cleaning your registry . look every entry this suite wants delete . if you run it default , it may remove critical registry keys settings . fact , i'd use different registry cleaner or some free ones . fix-it some great features , but not enough make it worth system resources system sluggish system . ( not mention anti-virus problem ) . try system mechanic instead .	-1

since most complaints recent switchers i went ahead bought this because most their problems don't apply me ( running powerpc , no old data transfer ) , because intuit offers 60 day money back satisfaction guarantee . oh , i downloaded it their site , saving like 5 bucks . here thing . qfx file quicken uses get data financial institutions restricted . my bank offers download , so i get file just fine . however , part quicken import process internet check bank see if they " support " mac users . support , all really means bank pays quicken allow mac users import their qfx files . if not , you get error message saying try import again later . there hack floating around ' net invloves changing some text qfx file , it works . but there cheaper alternatives out there support format ( moneydance one ) no fuss . aside this issue , interface really bad . it looks like check register . if i wanted glorified spreadsheet shape my checkbook , i would made one . program not even close intuitive , which means if you dislike/avoid tracking your finances like me this software scare you away pretty effectively , making your purchase pointless . lastly , customer support really very bad . you basically get canned responses don't even really address questions you ask , semi-broken english . i'm sure someone banks mac supported qfx , tons patience , predisposed dealing accounting minutiae would find this program useful/powerful . me , all advanced features world don't matter if i can't even use most basic ones	-1

honestly , i don't know how much more they improve adobe acrobat . it excellent product , god-send electronic file management . i upgraded version 6.0 . only problem i 6.0 it seemed terribly slow . this new version seems much brisker . it loads quickly , files seem " print " it much more quickly than version 6.0 . i not utilize " one-button " feature it provides ms office other programs . i try keep all my programs non-integrated possible , because my previous experiences showed they really , really bog each other down , no matter how much their makers claim they won't . i don't come close using all features acrobat , but my needs , it far surpasses anything else i've tried ( or researched ) . if you're problems version 6.0 , or older version you just want upgraded , i strongly recommend this . however , i don't foresee ever needing upgrade acrobat again	1

i used this program 5-state road trip midwest , while overall it " adequate , " it some key shortcomings . bad stuff : first , this not especially user-friendly program ; there steep learning curve operate it ease predictability . spend lot time playing this before using it primary navigator ! lot commands not intuitive , you need go through lot menus figure things out . this problem when you road looking get somewhere . it doesn't lot clickable buttons main screen . example , get program talk you , you must certain tab bottom screen . if you any other many tabs , program doesn't talk you or show you turns . it took me hours figure this out ! help function useless . second , tracking very slow , result you easily overshoot your turns -- especially when there no physical street signs many areas country -- which happened me numerous times . many times screen showed me i lot farther go before scheduled turn , this caused me overshoot it when there no sign . third , " rerouting " function awful perhaps biggest problem this program : if you stray route -- even pull off get gas -- program flips out keeps trying route you back original route even if route not easiest or most direct . i not found way it manually or automatically calculate new different route . i also found no way modify route once you begin route ( see below ) . several times several different cities , re-routing function totally wrong -- spitting out names streets weren't even screen close zoom level . this really annoying glitch , it happened without fail every time i strayed route . once off route , there no way hush program yelling you you're off route , there also no way easily program recalculate change route . when there construction you didn't anticipate , example , this program sucks able change route once you've started it . very annoying . there no construction updater plug-in , which would helpful long term construction projects go forever . fourth , program not audibly warn you if you going wrong way one way street . this actually happened me , there no " one way " signs particular street springfield , il . though there green arrows screen indicate one-way , but voice commands didn't warn me i actually going wrong way , so i not looking screen , i wouldn't known . you can't always look screen when driving . iowa i35 , construction brought northbound drivers over southbound lanes . i heading north southbound lanes ( i supposed ) but there no visual or audible indication i going wrong way ! big time safety issue here . fifth , search function wholly lacking not easy use . i needed find police station while missouri -- no such luck . i also needed find state fairgrounds missouri ( which i later came across screen ) but it not show up when i intentionally searched it . search limitations second biggest problem this program . sixth , several times screen showed me " off route " totally blacked-out area no roads around me when i fact u.s. highway or interstate . something wasn't communicating correctly . other times screen showed me more than 1000 feet off highway even though i certainly highway . illinois , screen showed i pretty much driving through corn fields even though i u.s. route . this problem pronounced multi-lane highways . if you're not center lane , often program indicates you're off route . very annoying . seventh , zoom level not stay constant ; it fluctuates automatically high zoom far-out zoom . i wanted high zoom most time see all minor roads landmark indicators , but program kept zooming out every few minutes . eighth , help function joke . it totally lacking substantive information . program should come separate dvd movie showing how use it . ninth , program not recognize lot road name synonyms . example , some u.s. routes also county/state/local designation numbers and/or alphabetic name , but map often only listed one or two many " also known " names/numbers . this quite problematic when signs roads don't match up turn commands ( e.g. " turn left u.s. route 40 , " when only street signs showed alphabetic name no numbers . this also quite annoying . tenth , antenna comes program sucks . without fail , i would get red " no signal " indicator every city i where there high-rise buildings . this happened kansas city , des moines , indianapolis , springfield . if you city , you risk no gps tracking ability . yes , my antenna mounted recommended . one point i held it up through my open sun roof no success . eleventh , main-screen buttons way too small use while driving if laptop your passenger seat . you pretty much pull over or risk crashing see what you're clicking . yes , i'm aware disclaimer program states you should separate navigator operate program while driving . i'm also aware almost no one who uses this program actually navigator/operator . twelfth , trip planning lacking . when you input starting ending point , program gives you one route . there no way easily plan alternate routes or preview them . true , you things like program it not take you toll roads , but this function not easy use . several times program kept me off interstates when i wanted them , sometimes it kept my interstates when i wanted u.s. or smaller county roads ( sightseeing purposes ) . i would go off route listen program whine off route . thirteenth , i emailed list my concerns/constructive criticisms/recommendations folks delorme . never heard back them , which concern me quality issue . ok , so there some redeeming qualities : first , * general * gps tracker on-target . 95% my 2000-mile trip , i knew where i program operated just fine . just realize this program ( well gps general ) lot limitations , especially when there bad weather or you woodsy area or place lot obstructions . third , you easily add points interest comments yourself . i used this function lot mark places where i want return take photos daylight . fourth , there selectable function show high contrast colors ( black background bright road colors ) . this quite helpful . summation , money this program good deal , but not rely it ( or any gps program ) your * sole * source road information/navigation . if i hadn't my rand mcnally paper road atlas back-up state city maps i borrowed library , i would big trouble several times . there lot ways this program should improved , but meantime i'd still recommend it despite problems . knowing limitations i've listen save you time frustration . there no better alternative imho price . it possible some my complaints fixes , but you wouldn't know it crappy help function .	-1

after using this software week , i'm generally pleased results . learning curve not too difficult climb ; though i some prior experience less sophisticated versions this type software . box comes thick printed manual , which nice reference . index manual good but not great . unfortunately manual not comprehensive . it appears cover core functionality but not any depth its discussion " power tools " . manual appears nearly verbatim copy online help . software comes short online instructional videos -- basically animated screen captures voice-over commentary . two or three videos i've watched filled gaps manual left open . my pc 2001-era 1ghz celeron 1gb memory . it renders 3d drawings fast enough not frustrating , i limited patience this sort thing . however , i not added great amounts detail plan yet -- mostly just walls , roof , electrical , some trim . addition detail may slow rendering down enough annoying . other reviewers complained performance , but documentation hints speeding up if you run into problems . while core parts software pretty good , power tools leave little something desired . this may just lack education my part , but if so then i'm going blame skimpy documentation . these power tools almost appear developed either different groups or third parties . overall they lack polish usability part core software . take " room wizard " , example . this slick way put together interior floor plan house . problem room wizard launches almost separate application , when you're it asks " update current design " . when you say yes , it appears paste picture drawn room wizard back into main application . there , it difficult ( impossible ? ) get interior layout overlay your foundation design . i difficulty other power tools : topo designer clunky , site planner annoying lot size limitation ( no line more than 1000 ' ) , estimator won't let you add additional materials ( you put cost concrete your foundation , but you can't add fill or stone drainage ; if i manually put this stuff into separate spreadsheet then built-in estimator pointless ) . so . again , maybe this learning thing , but rest software easy figure out -- why these so different ? overall , i would give software 3.5 stars : four stars doing stuff it absolutely must very well , minus one star advertising extras don't work so good , plus star good documentation core functionality , minus half star failing document extras . ( i figure extra thirty fifty bucks cost over competing brands due these extras , but i haven't tried competition .	-1

pros : good , well contructed , colorimeter novice , easy use software walks you through every step . i notice definite improvement my new 22 " ws lcd picture . i tried adobe gamma quick gamma , but these programs rely your eyes making brightness contrast corrections , setting gamma . my eyes not sharp they 20 years ago . cons : new updated software , version 2.3 , out since june , 2006 but colorvision still shipping older version . go their website [ ... ]) , download 2.3 ( 110.3 mb ) , install it , use keycode your 2.2 version run it . 2.3 version changes target white point lcds 6500k instead native . i personally prefer 6500k anyway . gamma 2.2 6500k only choices express . if you want more choices you purchase more expensive pro version . after calibration exiting software i got " not find color profile " error message . rebooting solved this . counter-weight adjusted , i still tilt my lcd monitor back 15 - 20 degrees before i could get spyder lay completely flat screen .	-1
