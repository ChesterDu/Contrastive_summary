i just purchased hallmark card studio 2004 (...) . everything installed fine but when attempting print card , first side printed fine , but when printing next side i keep getting " this program performed illegal operation shut down " . i contact their technical support but not any luck so far . i wasted lot paper ink so far getting just part card printed . i am running windows 98se . i probably returning this store ( if possible ) . it looked some nice cards it , which basically all i wanted it , but some reason not print correctly my computer .	1
1 . you can't print anything over 8.5 x14 paper . useless if you want review your house any standard scale . 2 . i bought this thinking it would better than my 1993 version 3.0 broderbund 3d home architect . it turns out this exactly same software ! i strongly recommend looking something better	-1
i trusted this software would what it claimed so let down its lack performance i am dumbfounded left speechless . during backup process i selected 15gb info backup , spanning 4 dvds . everything looked fine , except two ( 2 ) simple errors i received , indicating those related files may not copied/backed up properly . i figured no big deal , 2 files/errors out 15gb , i could handle . based upon false pretenses my critical info backed up properly ( simple pictures , videos , mp3 files financial files include previous years tax files ) , i then proceeded slick my drive . remember , only 2 simple , benign almost inconspicuous errors during backup process . everything looked great . during restore process , i then received numerous errors , each them requiring me click ' yes ' when asked if i wanted proceed . i got tired clicking yes around 100 or so mark decided click no . when you click ' no ' , everything undone ; there no ' ignore all ' function so i sit through every prompt got tired it decided proceeding 1000 files answering yes would involve too much pain me . i then selected smaller group files restored , only ' my documents ' folder but ran into same situation . eventually i ran test small folder restored still ran into errors but pressed through . hardly any files received error free those issues never restored . my guess approximately 2/3 or 3/4 my files not restored course none really mattered made it . i latest update applied program , so should not cause . i would better slick my entire hard drive without going through backup process i would nearly same place but without experiencing all headaches , frustrations investment hours , no days my time . program recently purchased microsoft inclusion vista os , i imagine . it well microsoft product , it fails deliver upon its promises	-1
this program not allow you switch elevation view or alter framing details . i'm only using it simple garage i expected able generate simple working plans basic demensions . not so . you might well pick up copy sims so you could least some fun it . if you want get rough ideas this might you but if you actually want work it , forget it . very disappointing waste money	-1
first all , microsoft needs come down their prices ( not this ever happen ) . i build computers living , i'd say 9 times out 10 windows single most expensive piece any pc i build . said , xp come long way . service pack 2 wonders security . i also found it most stable version windows i've used date . that not say it doesn't it flaws . it still lets it share " germs " , stops responding time time ( hangs ) , it very slow shut down . built-in cd writing software terrible remote desktop not always pleasure use either . however , biggest problem i've so far product activation . pc technician , i'm always testing new parts . most annoying problem i've after you make certain number hardware changes ( let say you replace video card , hard drive add some memory ) all within certain period time ( 180 days maybe ? ) windows makes you reactivate . this becomes problem when you reactivate twice within this period time . it makes you call microsoft , where you convince representitive you're not trying steal them . then you read them long number ( i think 41 digits ) then they'll read long number back you you need type . it driven me point using windows 2000 again test my parts , even though this isn't always practical testing xp compatibility . overall , i feel i paid too much this operating system .	1
i agree others who said it crashes system . overall , i found ss6 pro more problems than it worth -- even if it free , it not worth all time effort . besides all crashes , downloading virus/spyware updates via dialup takes forever ! each download runs 1 1 1/2 hours . forewarned . end , i returned my copy vcom , though date i not yet received refund	-1
front box it says it used professional photo editing 20,000 professionally designed projects , when i received box it disclaimer photos cannot used products re-sale , i purchased this product work home video spent all morning evaluating different software now i find out it totally worthless me . i went there website it says allow 4-6 weeks refund ! i am going turn them into ftc false advertisement	-1
i've norton anti-virus since 2002 my 2002 dell machine which meets teh program requirements . its gotten so slow really annoying use . it takes 30+ seconds open 2 page word document . when norton updating virus file , machine slows crawl , instead downloading quietly ( bit slower ) back groundits slowed machine such great extent we don't use sleep mode anymore because when machine woken up it take 10 minutes dsl update . its so slow i am trying kaspersky 6.0 . i don't know if thats better or worse , but since i don't go " dangerous " sits or perfom lots downloads its got better than teh current state . way i look it - norton anti-virus my machine functions 100% time if its slowed virus . anything bette	-1
this among most disappointing symantec products !!! when one tries log infovault , login box often empty ! there no way submit information . it also impossible get straight answer customer service . bring back old product , please !!!! norton customer years .... this one just not great !!	-1
i found this product represent extremely poor value money . i purchased product based all marketing hype testimonials . however , i since come conclusion these guys must pay people write positive testimonials . this product only covers basics ( levels 1 2 ) . then they try rope you into paying even more money their intermediate levels . i since purchased cheaper ' tell me more ' package ( spanish ) highly impressed scope it . they packed so much more value into their package . it complete package - all way advanced level . i think it really disgusting rosetta stone get away selling such seriously inferior product such highly inflated price people still buy it . i think it borders scam	-1
i looking intructional cd help my daughter learn chess . i read reviews endorsements thought this what i looking . wrong ! first all , cd comes no instruction book you're left try figure out what you're supposed yourself ( good luck ) . i've spent over 2 hours this thing so far i still haven't seen one thing would help my daughter learn play chess . i've emailed their ' help line ' hoping get some answers never heard back them . save your money your sanity don't buy this cd .	-1
benefits may great , but exercises so boring it way too much effort them regular basis	1
i've using apple macintosh systems since 1984 seen some great improvements system stability , which i consider most important aspect os . first off tiger smooth running system ( when it smoothly running ) , some nicest bells whistles around . best dog-and-pony show around . said , watch out ! this os capable completely hosing your user settings , all your software registrations , bookmarks , email settings , etc . whole enchilada . any os drop dime isn't worth time . since i use disk warrior , cocktail disk utility regularly , this should never happened . i waited until os 10.4.3 stage before upgrading 10.3.9 -- apparently it not yet ready -- best wait year before upgrading . hopefully these bugs fixed	-1
this caused serious technical errors my systems -- all new laptops , desktops . it cause ms word 2007 crash also cause number errors your file system , possibly requiring you re-install your vista os . worked well windows xp office 2003 environment , they claim this vista compatible , paperport 11 . company not offer me refund . i pursue .	-1
i've used paperport years mostly because it best bunch poor options . however , version 11 buggier than earlier versions : every time i launch microsoft office product , paperport installer starts up . there no reference this paperport help file or ridiculously inadequate knowledgebase paperport site . bug imprints " trial copy " legend your pdf files . this one explained knowledgebase , but requires you tinker registry correct it . that bit ridiculous . why they distributing code known bug ? nuance expects you pay $9.95 e-mail technical support - even if it bug their own product . product modest performer best , but nuance awful technical support policies real sinker here . i've requested rma refund . jerr	-1
i wanted make sure people who look this product full understanding adobe audition 2.0 not install windows 2000 pro or server operating system . almost every reference i seen regarding os requirements say windows but not specifically windows xp . only exceptions audition box itself this amazon listing ( go amazon ) . so if you windows 2000 user understand you need xp this product . if you find copy audition 1.5 you're good go . i would say more product if i could actually get it installed but 12 pcs i use not one xp so i $300+ book end until i upgrade ( if you call it ) xp	-1
okay ... so i'm not astute technical aspects software some reviewers , but i say my experience this software absolutely terrible . first off , it built integrate outlook , but doesn't really . it always leaves one e-mail your outbox ( one you posted first ) . if you open your outbox before they send , then one you posted most recently won't send either . seriously , only way i dealing this i left dead e-mail box permanently . if i need change something posted outbox , i open it , then get out outbox , change it , repost it , otherwise it won't send -- ever . i set nis so it doesn't scan my outgoing e-mail , it blocks anything over 2mb , my business , i send things big all time . recent update , however , it reinstated now scans all my outgoing e-mail whether it set or not . i spent hours hours phone ( supposed ) technicians , who refused answer any questions unless i disabled my whole network . what this program , i don't know . i tried " live internet chat " function , but -- i kid you not -- it took almost two hours me get ten responses guy . when i complained , he hung up me . gotta love . when i tell nis something it categorised spam " isn't spam " , it doesn't remember sender e-mail address , like it supposed . it just keeps calling it spam quarantining it . regarding spyware , i piece anti-spyware software called webroot spy sweeper , routinely finds spyware my computer nis didn't catch . this just one headache after . their customer service unresponsive totally unhelpful , not one actual solution any these problems . only piece software i ever bought anywhere close bad this winfax 10 , norton product . i never , ever buy piece norton/symantec software again long i live . they should ashamed themselves	-1
if i could give it 0 star , i would . my humble opinion kaspersky not better than norton slowing down your computer . one brand new computer , plenty space memory . one old computer but plenty space memory well . each time kaspersky updates , i can't open outlook express nor explorer . well , programs open actually but i time vacuum dust before they're launched . i used repair fonction uninstalled reinstalled without any improvement . samwis	-1

many who like writing html/xhtml code , homesite holds special place heart . it just feels so right addictive . tool extended , extensions use script which makes development cycle dead easy . support macromedia not good . now adobe process buying macromodia ( 2005-04-19 ) so who knows where it all goes . saying people who like this product still like it prefer it . if it fits you don't need support . you just run it day after day it works great .

there no other product which compares microsoft office suite . " microsoft office standard edition " place get started . it place you'll probably stay . you need word excel , occasionally , powerpoint . learn basic word processing spreadsheet usage . shine meetings powerpoint . you need upgrade xp ? not likely . there no new features i found impressive after xp version years . it lacks access , but most people don't need database strength it , survive nicely just excel . e-mailing documents files coworkers , you confident they'll easily open office files . there good chance they use it themselves . outlook one those highly underrated , but enormously useful applications help you organize your contacts , schedule tasks easily . you use it e-mail reader well , though feature vulnerable viruses . word huge program which far more than you'll need , but it allow you versatility simplicity wordperfect yet pull off . excel basic spreadsheet incredible math functionality . i don't need most math tools , other than minor budgets such . i find it handy tracking my poetry submissions ; i see which magazine i sent which piece when , how when they replied . powerpoint makes those cool slideshows text animated screen . templates , you look good without requiring graphic design degree . i fully recommend " microsoft office standard edition . " it business home office standard . you need it , it easy learn , price right . anthony trendleditor , hungarianbookstore.co	1

i use microsoft streets trips 2007 laptop computer navigational assistance anytime i'm traveling destination where i'm not absolutely certain how get there . general , i'm pleased it performance . it saved me wrong turns many times . however , data seems much five years out date many street additions . gps tracking country roads inaccurate enough cause constant " off route " - " back route " messages you navigate twists turns . i suspect , case , map data just not accurate	1
this great pda bible many reasons , several which already mentioned other reviews . it easy use , most niv study bible notes crossreferences , comes multi color highlighter ( great using different colors different purposes ... red commands , blue promises , etc . ) , you change font easier reading , it great search engine case you want all references , say " peace " occured new testament . programs come it nice well , including one tells you what read if you want read bible one year , ot one year , nt one year , many more options . i somewhat disappointed few features would made it hands-down 5 star program , though . original niv study bible elaborate introductions each book , including author , purpose , structure , much more . palm version lacking all this , no introduction all . original also many cultural information boxes all throughout bible , like description differences pharasees sauducees ; palm version not . cross references wonderful - click small circle after verse , all cross references pop up . simply click cross reference , program takes you right there . unfortunately , however , palm program no feature like " back " button gets you back original text . finding your original spot not difficult - it only takes 5 seconds little concentration - but would much nicer go instantly back same way you instantly get cross refernce clicking it . finally , i would actively marketing this product palm platform all my friends if it included all wonderful maps original - maps holyland , jerusalem , middle east , temple , others my paper niv study bible . despite these flaws , however , program joy use i highly recommend it all . i am using tungsten t3 - larger screen size make reading easier	1

ms put office 2007 dvd rather than cd so there only one disk , so they make installation easier right off bat . unlike all previous versions office , you not get into details what options you want . previous versions , if you didn't make sure you installed all features , when you went function wasn't installed , you dig out your office disks install feature . huge pain , but not anymore . installation hands down easiest all versions office . you don't tell it manually where find your files . you don't manually put your favorite buttons . it all you . yes it takes some getting use new layout functions , but once you figure them out , it so nice smooth . this version light years better than all previous versions . most impressive part installation outlook 2007 . all previous versions , you export import all your files contacts . anyone who experienced this , knows it never went smooth . sometimes it awful you lost emails contacts transfer , time it took this , very painful . this not case outlook 2007 . just load program it all transfers your previous version outlook . you don't thing , you're up running without missing beat when program loading . you shocked how simple it . anything new it growing pains learn , but once you , you very glad you made change	1
